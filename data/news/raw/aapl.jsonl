And I want to take a look at how shares have performed this week. So Apple now up 13% on the week, it is up another 4% today. And what's interesting with this Apple move, of course, this main move coming Wednesday after Tim Cook and President Trump were at the White House on that day and the rally is really sort of continued. But what's interesting in this move with Apple is if we zoom out on the year and we talk about this mag 7, this big tech rally that we've seen for really two years now, but you take a look at a year to date at Apple, Apple had not been participating in this rally. Apple was down more than 15% on the year, a clear laggard among big tech. Now it's starting to come up positive. Our friend Jerry Blickary has pointed out that a 215 level on Apple was a very interesting remembrance point for investors. Apple has surged past that. Now, that of course begs the question of if Apple can get back to positive this this year and keep rallying. And I do want to bring in our Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley to break this down a little bit more. Dan, just interesting to see the move in Apple this week. Of course, shares reacting well to this investment. I mean, how does this sort of add to their overall US investment and how have you sort of made sense of the Apple story this week?\n\n02:47 Dan Howley\n\nYeah, it does add to their US investment. Uh they they obviously are pushing this uh you know, building in America uh kind of narrative. And yes, they are investing in America. They are going to be doing certain things in America. Um they're not building the iPhone in America. Uh that's not going to be happening. They're going to continue to build that overseas, but they are sourcing more or investing more in some of their uh supply chain partners in the US. That includes things like Samsung, Corning, uh what have you. Uh this is really a move, a strategic and political move by uh Apple. They were under the gun uh when it came to uh their relationship with Trump. Uh there was calls for them to build in the US. There were uh discussions on, you know, uh I think at one point Peter Navarro had gone on CNBC and said that it was the biggest soap opera in Silicon Valley that the company couldn't build uh in the US. Experts that I spoke to said no, it really is uh an untenable question to ask them to to build in the US now at least within the next four years. The issue being that the supply chain isn't there, the workers aren't there, the skills don't really translate. Um there was an article in CNN uh discussing how Motorola had tried to have its own plant uh in the US where they were building smartphones and that folded in a year because the workers just had the choice between uh you know, working in a factory, having to develop skills or working in the restaurant industry. And it's you know, the question was, okay, what's going to take more time to learn? Uh and so that was an ongoing problem. They had initially said they were investing 500 billion in February. Then the the idea of building in the US became an issue, especially around the time the tariffs came out. Uh Tim Cook had kind of made the idea to move US bound iPhones out of China and into India to get around those tariffs. And the Trump administration didn't really appreciate that. And that's when you had these calls uh for Apple to, you know, build in the US. Uh there were some remarks that Trump had made about Tim Cook saying uh that he wasn't very happy with him uh at certain points. And so you have this hundred billion dollar investment, this meeting at the White House. Uh and then the same day, uh President Trump had said at that meeting that he was going to be doing the 100% tariff on semiconductors unless companies build in the US and that Apple would likely avoid that tariff because of the moves that it's making. So obviously, you know, Tim Cook is a smart executive. obviously he's been the CEO for Apple for years because of that. and this is just kind of the the latest show of that kind of uh gamesmanship that he's he's able to work through.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-09T08:39:07.331812+00:00"}

CEO Tim Cook was in the White House for the unveiling, where President Trump also announced a 100% tariff on semiconductors produced overseas unless the company commits to building in the US.\n\n\"The good news for companies like Apple is, if you're building in the United States, or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge,\" Trump said.\n\nRead more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\n\nApple's shares rose by 0.4% before the bell on Friday, after closing 3% higher the day before. The stock has traded 12% lower year to date as investors remain concerned the company is falling behind in the AI race.\n\nBerry noted that Cook's political engagement benefits shareholders by \"fostering relationships with powerful decision-makers.\" But investors shouldn't confuse Cook's political goodwill with real impact.\n\nFor investors, the key question is whether Apple's investment will meaningfully reduce its tariff risk. While Apple has moved some iPhone assembly to India and explored alternatives like Vietnam, the company's semiconductor packaging and most of its core hardware production still rely on Chinese factories.\n\nBerry emphasized that building out domestic capacity, especially at Apple's scale, will take years. The timeline to secure permits, construct factories, hire and train workers, and begin mass production likely exceeds the next three and a half years, she noted. Additionally, tariffs could shift within that period.\n\n\"I highly doubt that Apple is going to start breaking ground on as much new kind of land,\" Berry said, which means it may not meaningfully change Apple's near-term supply chain exposure.\n\nDespite the cautious outlook, some on Wall Street cheered the news. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan raised the firm's price target from $213 to $250, citing the upside potential if the company is exempt from tariffs.\n\nMohan suggests that if the US government grants Apple an exemption, the company might reduce its projected fourth quarter headwinds of $1.1 billion, although the precise details remain undefined. This action could also bolster confidence in Apple's gross margin expansion, which Bank of America anticipates will reach 50%.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-09T08:39:08.841710+00:00"}

There are official distinctions, like S&P 500 components versus those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but there are also more nuanced groupings, like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, etc.\n\nSometimes, investors will get a little whimsical and come up with catchy names to describe red-hot, winning stocks. The \"Nifty Fifty\" was a popular term for large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nJim Cramer used \"FANG\" to describe Facebook (now Meta Platforms (META 0.92%)), Amazon (AMZN -0.23%), Netflix (NFLX 2.65%), and Google (now Alphabet (GOOG 2.44%) (GOOGL 2.48%)). It eventually expanded to \"FAANG\" to include Apple (AAPL 4.24%).\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the largest seven technology-focused companies: Nvidia (NVDA 1.05%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (TSLA 2.28%).\n\nBut the Magnificent Seven has its problems, which is why I'm introducing the \"Ten Titans\" -- the Magnificent Seven plus Broadcom (AVGO 0.40%), Oracle (ORCL 0.28%), and Netflix.\n\nHere's why the Ten Titans is a better representation of top growth stocks than the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe Broadcom blunder\n\nThe biggest flaw of the Magnificent Seven is that it doesn't include Broadcom. It's up about 450% in the last three years, which has pole-vaulted its market cap well over $1 trillion.\n\nBased on market cap, it deserves to be included in the Magnificent Seven over Tesla. However, some folks may prefer the diversification that Tesla brings to the table with electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). And some may argue that it's redundant to include both Nvidia and Broadcom since they're both chip giants, but Broadcom has a much different business than Nvidia.\n\nNvidia generates the vast majority of its profits by selling graphics processing units and associated hardware and software to data centers. Like Nvidia, Broadcom makes AI chips, and AI is its fastest-growing segment, making up around 30% of total revenue in its latest quarter. But the bulk of Broadcom's business is not directly tied to AI.\n\nEnd markets include networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, infrastructure software, and more. In fact, Broadcom was considered a dividend-paying value stock before its recent boom -- similar to another high-yield semiconductor stalwart, Texas Instruments.\n\nAnother \"value\" stock turned growth stock\n\nNot long ago, Oracle was seen more as a mature tech stock with an entrenched legacy business and limited upside potential. Investors were more excited about hotter software stocks like Salesforce, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Palo Alto Networks. However, Oracle has completely transformed its business, integrating cloud infrastructure as a complement to its foothold in database software and enterprise applications.\n\nOracle has carved out a growing role in the cloud that is uniquely different from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle's hybrid and multicloud strategy integrates with the major cloud players, which allows customers to use Oracle's database advantages even if they're with another cloud provider.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers some advantages over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, including lower prices in some cases, more AI tools, and vertical integration with the company's other database services.\n\nSome drawbacks of OCI are that it has a smaller ecosystem with fewer preset tools for developers. However, Oracle is growing faster than the major players with a 27% year-over-year cloud revenue increase in its most recent quarter, including a 52% rise in cloud infrastructure revenue.\n\nLike Broadcom, Oracle is a great addition to the Ten Titans because it's a highly diversified company that's playing a growing role in AI.\n\nFAANG's anchor is a worthy addition to the Ten Titans\n\nNetflix was an integral part of FANG and FAANG, but it fell out of favor for a while as it underperformed the broad market. The streaming company is now worth around half a trillion dollars, which has catapulted it to the top 20 S&P 500 companies by market cap.\n\nNetflix has pulled back from its recent highs, but the stock has still crushed the S&P 500 year to date. A big reason for its rebound in recent years is its improved cost management and more purposeful spending.\n\nA major problem with the business in the past was the boom-and-bust nature of its earnings. The company would steadily grow subscribers, but it would overspend on content and have dry spells without major success.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix spent most of the 2010s being inconsistently profitable. But over the last five years, profits have skyrocketed and its operating margin continues to climb in lockstep with revenue.\n\nThe company has revolutionized entertainment and remains the gold standard in streaming, despite tons of new competition. A lot of that success comes down to its ability to balance the quantity and quality of content it produces.\n\nIt's time to add some all-stars to the team\n\nExpanding the Magnificent Seven to the Ten Titans corrects for the blatant error of Broadcom's omission and includes massively important growth stocks in Oracle and Netflix. Over the next three to five years, it wouldn't be surprising if all of the Titans were worth over $1 trillion due to their industry leadership and runways for growth.\n\nWith a combined weighting of 37.7% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans offer investors a useful way to track the top growth stocks that can really move the major indexes and keep tabs on prevailing themes that are driving the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-09T08:39:10.649322+00:00"}

Until we get more clarity, here’s where things stand:\n\nEarnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nBut growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.\n\nActions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nStocks are not the economy: There’s a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nMind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nInvesting is never a smooth ride: There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nThink long-term: For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T07:36:14.864348+00:00"}

AMD will deliver the same share from MI308 revenues, the person added, asking for anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe arrangement reflects US President Donald Trump’s consistent effort to engineer a financial payout for America in return for concessions on trade. His administration has shown a willingness to relax trade conditions like tariffs in return for giant investment in the US — as with Apple Inc.’s pledge to spend $600 billion on domestic manufacturing. But such a narrow, select export tax has little precedent in modern corporate history.\n\nBeijing, which has grown increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese firms deploying the H20, is unlikely to warm to the idea of a chip tax. Yuyuantantian, a social media account affiliated with state-run China Central Television that regularly signals Beijing’s thinking about trade, on Sunday slammed the chip’s supposed security vulnerabilities and inefficiency.\n\n“This seeming quid pro quo is unprecedented from an export control perspective. The arrangement risks invalidating the national security rationale for U.S. export controls,” said Jacob Feldgoise, a researcher at the DC-based Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\nIt “will likely undermine the US’ position when negotiating with allies to implement complementary controls,” he added. “Allies may not believe U.S. policymakers if they are willing to trade away those same national security concerns for economic concessions — either from U.S. companies or foreign governments.”\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said the company follows US export rules, adding that while it hasn’t shipped H20 chips to China for months, it hopes the rules will allow US companies to compete in China. AMD didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Financial Times earlier reported the development. It followed a separate report from the same outlet that the Commerce Department had begun issuing H20 licenses last week, days after Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang met with Trump.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T07:36:18.916593+00:00"}

Opportunity is knocking.\n\nGot some idle cash you're ready to put to work for a while? Although the market's rally to record highs -- and steep valuations -- might make it feel like there's not much worth stepping into at this time, worthy opportunities are out there. You just have to dig deeper to find them, and perhaps look a bit off of the beaten path.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three growth stocks to consider scooping up sooner than later, while each is still underpriced thanks to recent but unmerited weakness.\n\n1. Upstart\n\nYes, Upstart (UPST -1.01%) shares stumbled on Wednesday in response to its second-quarter report. Although revenue of $257.3 million topped analysts' expectations of $226.5 million and adjusted per-share earnings of $0.36 beat expectations of only $0.25, the Q2 earnings call highlighted lingering risks like inflation and competition. Investors took that ball and ran with it, dragging UPST shares down 19% for the day.\n\nThe market, however, arguably lost all perspective on the matter. Revenue still doubled year over year, and the company went from an operating loss of $55.5 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier to operating income of $4.5 million this time around.\n\nBest of all, Upstart's guidance for the rest of the year also suggests this degree of growth should persist at least through the end of the year. Indeed, analysts are calling for a top line of more than $1.5 billion for 2027, versus this year's projected revenue of just over $1.0 billion while annual per-share profits are expected to grow from $1.51 to $3.12 during the same three-year span. It looks like Upstart's business is here to stay.\n\nBut what is its business? In simplest terms, Upstart is a new kind of credit-scoring bureau.\n\nAlthough plenty of banks and lenders still rely on information from Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian when making lending decisions about potential borrowers, their credit-risk assessments aren't necessarily the most accurate anymore. Using an artificial intelligence algorithm that considers more than 1,600 different data points, Upstart's approach allows for 43% more loan approvals with no more defaults than the more commonly used scoring system from credit bureaus.\n\nLenders are finally catching on, too. The total number of loans the company's tech facilitated jumped 159% last quarter as well.\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nMuch like Upstart's stock, MercadoLibre (MELI 1.00%) shares initially tanked in response to Monday afternoon's release of its second-quarter earnings. Revenue of $6.79 billion beat estimates of $6.67 billion, but earnings of $10.31 per share fell well short of the expected $11.93.\n\nAlthough the stock fought its way back to a gain on Tuesday, it's been rough sailing ever since. The stock's now down about 5% from its post-earnings peak, and more than 12% below May's record high and still testing new multi-week lows.\n\nAs with Upstart, investors may be missing the much bigger bullish picture here.\n\nSee, MercadoLibre is an all-encompassing e-commerce platform that's often compared to Amazon, frequently referred to as \"the Amazon of Latin America\" in a nod to its growing dominance of the region's e-commerce arena.\n\nIf it wants to truly become the Amazon of that particular market, though, it must do there what Amazon did here. That's offering free shipping even if it hurts profit margins -- which it did last quarter. But in the long run the trade-off is worth it, particularly given the fragmented nature of Latin America's online shopping industry, making it still up for grabs.\n\nAnd the opportunity is enormous. With broadband internet and smartphones just now becoming common in the region, Payments and Commerce Market Intelligence expects Latin America's e-commerce industry to double in size between 2023 and 2027, when it will be worth more than $1 trillion.\n\nThe thing is, MercadoLibre is clearly cashing in on this growth. Although it missed its second-quarter earnings estimates, revenue was up 34% year over year. And while operating income only improved a relatively modest 14%, the reason is neither surprising nor troubling -- it was the free shipping it offered to Brazil's consumers that ate into its profit margins. Again, the short-term pain is worth the long-term growth the free shipping perk sets up.\n\n3. Apple\n\nFinally, add Apple (AAPL 4.24%) to your list of growth stocks to buy if you've got $1,000 (or more) you're ready to put to work.\n\nNo, it's not off the beaten path the way Upstart and MercadoLibre are. Apple is currently the world's third-biggest publicly traded company, sporting a market cap of nearly $3.3 trillion. Like MercadoLibre and Upstart, though, Apple's stock is undervalued thanks to unmerited weakness since late last year.\n\nBlame its fumbled entry into the era of on-device artificial intelligence, mostly.\n\nWhen Apple Intelligence was first unveiled in June of last year, consumers as well as investors were excited that the tech would turn their iPhones and iPads into stand-alone generative AI devices. September's introduction of the newest mobile devices capable of running Apple Intelligence stoked further optimism. Then October's actual release of Apple Intelligence tech was met with cheers.\n\nBy December, however, consumers and analysts were largely in agreement that the onboard AI tool just didn't live up to the hype. Apple's stock has been struggling since, in the shadow of failure that the world's not accustomed to seeing from this iconic company.\n\nThere's hope on the horizon, though. While it took a painful wake-up call to get the ball rolling, Apple has spent the past several months restructuring and rethinking its entire approach to consumer-facing artificial intelligence. It's also likely come to appreciate that it's better to wait until a new tech is fully ready before launching it. In this vein, the company now says the next version of its AI-powered digital assistant Siri won't be released until early in the coming year, just to make sure it's truly ready.\n\nWhile it's been a relatively ugly stretch for the company, just bear in mind that stocks reflect their underlying company's future rather than their past. And Apple's future looks bright in light of Precedence Research's outlook for the intelligence virtual assistant market, which it expects to grow at an average annual pace of 24% through 2034.\n\nThe irony is that investors are already seeing glimmers of hope from Apple even before it's fully regrouped. Last quarter's top line was up 10% year over year, led by iPhone revenue growth despite plenty of nay-saying about the most recent versions of the device.\n\nAnalysts are still calling for a slower growth pace ahead, but AAPL stock's strong rally since the late-July release of last quarter's results suggests investors may be expecting more. The thing is, in this instance, the trading crowd may well be right.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T07:36:20.229268+00:00"}

I think all of these stocks are growing more interesting each day, but of the seven, I think five are a buy and two are to be watched.\n\nI'm keeping an eye on Apple and Tesla\n\nOver the past few years, many of these companies have delivered explosive revenue growth, except for Apple. Apple's growth finally returned in Q3 FY 2025, delivering double-digit growth (if you round up) for the first time since early 2022.\n\nStill, there are some questions about being behind in the AI arms race and what Apple's next big product is. I'm not ready to declare Apple a buy yet, but it's growing more intriguing with each quarter.\n\nTesla is in the worst shape of any Magnificent Seven company, with revenue falling 16% year over year in Q2. Additionally, with EV and regulatory credits getting eliminated, significant headwinds are popping up. However, Tesla's business has never been solely about EVs; otherwise, its valuation wouldn't make sense. An investment in Tesla is a bet that its humanoid robots, AI, self-driving, and rob-taxis will all be successes eventually. But for right now, I'm comfortable waiting on Tesla's situation to improve.\n\nI'm a buyer of the remaining five\n\nThe other five members of the Magnificent Seven all look promising to me, as they're all experiencing strong growth.\n\nMeta Platforms delivered a shocking Q2 report that delivered 22% revenue growth despite only guiding for 13% growth. That strength is expected to continue through Q3, with 20% revenue growth expected.\n\nMeta's advertising business is second to none, and the improvements it's making with AI to aid in ad creation and engagement are starting to pay off.\n\nAlphabet similarly had a strong advertising quarter, despite many investors being worried about Google Search potentially being left behind by generative AI. Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year, showcasing its strength and silencing doubters about its longevity.\n\nCompanywide, Alphabet's revenue rose 14% year over year, with diluted earnings per share rising 22%. That's an impressive result from a company that is supposed to be struggling. Additionally, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading for 20 times forward earnings.\n\nAll of this combines to make Alphabet one of the best stocks to buy right now.\n\nDespite Microsoft being the second-largest company in the world, it delivered monster growth in Q4 FY 2025 (ended June 30). Revenue was up 18% year over year, but the biggest shock in its report was Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing product and is a leading platform for building AI models. Azure's revenue was up a jaw-dropping 39% this quarter, showcasing strong demand for computing power.\n\nThis tailwind will persist for some time, making Microsoft an excellent stock to scoop up now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN -0.20%) investors had a negative reaction to its report, which caused shares to sink following earnings. However, I don't think they were as bad as the market thought, and the long-term outlook is still positive for the company.\n\nAmazon's profit growth continues to outpace revenue growth thanks to the strength of high-margin businesses like advertising and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAs long as this trend continues, Amazon will be a strong long-term pick. With both advertising and AWS being Amazon's fastest-growing segments by far, this trend looks primed to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nLast is Nvidia, which hasn't reported earnings yet. However, all of the companies involved in building out AI infrastructure on this list stated that their capital expenditures will be rising next year due to increased data center spend. This bodes well for Nvidia, as it receives a huge chunk of this spend. Additionally, Nvidia has reapplied for its export license to begin shipping H20 chips to China again, which will provide another growth tailwind for its business.\n\nI expect Nvidia to report blowout earnings on Aug. 27, making the stock a smart stock to scoop up before then. Nvidia may be the world's largest company, but I expect it to get even bigger with increased AI buildout.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T07:36:23.140947+00:00"}

That might seem like a silly question to ask about a company with a market cap of roughly $3.3 trillion and sales that will almost certainly top $400 billion this year. However, many investors view Apple as an underdog in a critical arena: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nRumors have floated recently, though, that Apple could be investing heavily in developing AI glasses and is considering a major AI-related acquisition. The company could probably nip investors' concerns if it played up either story. However, Apple's executives remain largely silent on its AI glasses strategy and any acquisition plans. Is that strategic genius on management's part or a warning sign for investors?\n\nPlaying it close to the vest in Cupertino\n\nCiti analyst Atif Malik gave Apple CEO Tim Cook a great opportunity to comment on the company's AI glasses strategy during Apple's fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings call on July 31. He first noted the momentum that Meta Platforms and Xiaomi are enjoying with their AI glasses. Malik then asked Cook if Apple was considering using the technology from its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset in other devices.\n\nDid Cook hit the ball out of the park with his response? For many investors, it was more like a swing and a miss. He first praised the latest release of visionOS, the operating system for Vision Pro. All Cook would say about the future of Vision Pro, though, is that the company is still \"very focused on it.\" He added, \"I don't want to get into the roadmap on it, but this is an area that we really believe in.\"\n\nMalik was also the only analyst on the call to bring up potential AI-related acquisitions. Addressing his question to Apple CFO Kevan Parekh, he asked, \"Do you feel like you need to accelerate your AI roadmap or just keep the organic focus?\"\n\nCook jumped in to reply instead of Parekh. He noted that Apple had acquired seven companies in 2025 already, although not all of them were related to AI. Anyone hoping for a hint that Apple was on the verge of a significant AI deal, however, was probably disappointed.\n\nTo be fair, Cook did state: \"We're very open to M&A [mergers and acquisitions] that accelerates our roadmap. We are not stuck on a certain size company, although the ones that we have acquired thus far this year are small in nature.\" But he quickly added that management didn't \"have anything to share specifically today.\"\n\nWhat should investors make of Apple's AI silence?\n\nIs Apple really behind several other technology giants in the AI race? I think the answer is clearly \"yes.\" The generative AI features in Apple Intelligence weren't as impressive as many investors expected. The delays in launching an update for Siri have also been embarrassing for the company.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't say that Apple's silence on its development plans for AI glasses or the possibility of AI-related acquisitions is a warning sign. The company has historically said very little about products in development until they're nearly ready to roll out. And staying quiet on potential business development deals is prudent, especially if there's a possibility that another big player could enter the picture.\n\nOn the other hand, I wouldn't necessarily call Apple's approach a brilliant strategy. In particular, it wouldn't hurt to at least acknowledge that developing new AI devices, such as glasses, was on the product roadmap.\n\nCook and his team are almost certainly aware of what other tech CEOs are saying. For example, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has unabashedly proclaimed that glasses are \"the ideal form factor for AI.\" Sundar Pichai, who is CEO of both Google and its parent, Alphabet, said in his company's latest quarterly update that Google is \"super excited about our investment in glasses\" and referred to the devices as \"an exciting new emerging category.\"\n\nIf Cook made similar comments, it wouldn't harm Apple's development plans. However, I suspect it would calm the nerves of some jittery investors.\n\nThree predictions about Apple's AI future\n\nWhat will Apple do regarding AI glasses and deals? I have three predictions.\n\nFirst, the company will, as rumored, develop AI glasses. The first version of those glasses will be comparable to the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, in my view. But I expect Apple to integrate the AI glasses with iPhone along the lines of what it has done with Apple Watch. That would be a smart strategy because it could boost iPhone sales.\n\nSecond, I don't look for Apple to make a huge AI acquisition. Just because Cook said that Apple isn't \"stuck on a certain size company\" doesn't mean he's willing to spend too much. The most Apple has ever spent on a deal was $3 billion for the purchase of Beats. I predict that the company won't acquire Perplexity, for example, which was recently valued at around $18 billion and would likely cost a lot more for Apple to buy.\n\nMy third prediction is the one I'm most confident about: Apple won't be an AI underdog forever. The company's fortunes hinge too much on the technology.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:24:31.006389+00:00"}

In fact, he and his team of investment managers at Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.40%) (BRK.B 0.83%) have been net sellers of stocks for 11 straight quarters.\n\nBuffett's stock sales have accelerated over the past five quarters. That includes monster sales of Berkshire's stakes in Apple and Bank of America. In the meantime, he's stopped buying one stock investors had seen him buy consistently each quarter since mid-2018. As a result, Berkshire's cash pile has climbed to a whopping $344 billion.\n\nBut the market may be offering Buffett an opportunity to start buying his favorite stock again, and investors should consider doing the same.\n\nBuffett isn't timing the market\n\nBuffett's big stock sales over the last few years and his lack of purchases may be seen by some as the Oracle of Omaha trying to predict the future and time the market. While it might look like market timing, Buffett is merely sticking to what's worked for him as an investor for the last 60 years or so.\n\n\"We try to price, rather than time, purchases,\" Buffett wrote in his 1994 letter to shareholders. The same could be said of Berkshire's stock sales. If the market is offering a massive premium on one of Berkshire's holdings, Buffett ought to sell it, pocket the cash, and look for opportunities in stocks trading well below their intrinsic value. That could even include buying Berkshire Hathaway shares themselves.\n\nIn fact, the board of directors updated its share repurchase policy in 2018, allowing Buffett to buy back shares of the company as long as it traded below its intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Buffett quickly went to work buying back shares following that change, indicating that the stock looked like a bargain. Between 2018 and May 2024, Buffett spent $78 billion buying back shares of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nOver the last 14 months, however, Buffett hasn't spent a single dollar buying back the stock based on Berkshire's quarterly earnings reports. He holds himself to the same high standards he expects of the CEOs of all the companies Berkshire invests in. \"All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done at a premium,\" he wrote in his 2023 letter to shareholders.\n\nBut Berkshire shares have fallen considerably since Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of the year during the company's annual meeting in May. And after a further sell-off sparked by its second-quarter earnings report, shares are starting to look a lot more appealing. That could open the door for Buffett to start buying back Berkshire's stock.\n\nWill Buffett start buying again?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's earnings disappointed many investors, leading the market to sell off the stock.\n\nAfter a stellar 2024, the insurance business is back to more normalized operations, including big payouts earlier this year due to the California wildfires. That's led to a drop in underwriting profits, which pushed the conglomerate's total operating earnings down nearly 4% last quarter. It's worth noting, however, that Berkshire faced significant foreign exchange headwinds last quarter, which negatively affected operating earnings.\n\nBerkshire also wrote down its Kraft Heinz investment by $5 billion. That follows a $3 billion impairment charge it took in 2019. That further negatively affected reported earnings.\n\nNonetheless, Buffett has seen the book value per share of Berkshire Hathaway climb, including a 2.1% gain from the first quarter, and a 10.9% increase from a year ago. Combined with the declining stock price over the last three months, Berkshire Hathaway shares now trade for a price-to-book ratio of about 1.5.\n\nThat's an important valuation, because when Buffett last repurchased shares of Berkshire, the stock traded below that valuation. The stock has rarely dipped below that price since last May. But shares are certainly more attractive after the sell-off.\n\nA couple of factors could keep Buffett from buying at the current price. First, Berkshire's marketable equity portfolio is a significant factor in its book value. Buffett may still see most of the stocks in the portfolio as overpriced, especially as stocks continued to climb over the past year. That would push him to require a lower multiple for Berkshire stock, since repurchasing Berkshire shares would also mean purchasing a small piece of its equity portfolio.\n\nThe other factor is that he may want to use a significant chunk of cash to bolster the railroad business in the near future. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have agreed to a merger, threatening the competitiveness of Berkshire's Burlington Northern Santa Fe.\n\nWhen you consider the strength of Berkshire's balance sheet and that it's not relying on insurance float for any capital at this point, it should trade for a higher price-to-book value ratio than it has historically. With shares trading around 1.5 times book value, the stock finally looks to be trading near its intrinsic value again, making it worth buying.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:00.199101+00:00"}

If you spend your time worrying about that, you’re going to fail for sure, because you’re going to miss the signal,” O’Leary continues.\n\nScoring a deal with “Mr. Wonderful” on Shark Tank and beyond is no easy venture—he’s known as a quick-witted, bold, and demanding business investor. And he isn’t afraid to ruffle some feathers, as he’s embodied a “ founder’s mindset ” that prioritizes signal over noise. That means being able to get three to five of the most important things done quickly, while drowning out outside chaos and distractions. It’s a leadership strategy he observed from Jobs in the 1990s, who often disregarded feelings in order to ensure his business partnerships thrived. O’Leary knows he needs to crack a few eggs to make an omlete—even if it means not being popular.\n\nO’Leary, the so-called “Mr. Wonderful,” doesn’t feel the need to play nice or sugarcoat his opinions, and it may be part of the reason why he’s amassed a $400 million fortune through his business success . The serial investor made a big splash in 1999 when he sold his business SoftKey Software Products to Mattel for $4.2 billion, just after working with Jobs on developing Apple’s educational software. O’Leary Ventures, his venture capital firm, has also backed more than 80 startups including sustainable company Blueland —which has raked in over $100 million in lifetime sales—and $14.5 million photo printing app Groovebook.\n\n“I don’t think people you work with need to be your friends,” O’Leary tells Fortune. “They have to respect you, and you have to lead them forward on their careers, make the money, and help them achieve their goals.”\n\nCEOs take on all sorts of personas, from the benevolent leader to the cutthroat business executive. Millionaire entrepreneur Kevin O’Leary is famous for his brutally honest , intimidating aura on-screen as a Shark Tank investor—and some of that leadership style rubbed off on him from working with the late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs .\n\nMultimillionaire Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary goes by the nickname “Mr. Wonderful,” but he doesn’t feel the need to play nice —he says being liked has nothing to do with success. In actuality, being a respected and effective business partner is most important, in order to tap into “signal” mode and drive the best results. It’s a leadership style he picked up from working with the late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs in the 1990s, who may not have been the most enjoyable to work with, but whose infectious success drew people into his orbit.\n\nStory Continues\n\n“The signal is not having everybody like you—that has nothing to do with success…You can’t worry about whose feelings you bruise. You’ve got to get it done.”\n\nWorking with Jobs and leading with tough love: ‘You’re gonna deal with it anyways’\n\nSilicon Valley CEOs aren’t known to be the most friendly or personable—and the late tech mogul Jobs was no exception to that rule.\n\nWhile SoftKey was working with Apple in creating new educational software, O’Leary had suggested that Jobs hear why teachers and students want from the games. But the Apple cofounder was having none of it, stating their opinions didn’t matter, and that the programs would work best under Jobs’ direction.\n\n“Over time, you want to be part of that momentum, because you’re on the winning team. We made a lot of money with Steve Jobs, he was right. ‘You make the software, I’ll deliver the market. Just go do it right.’ I listened to him, and he was right.”\n\nO’Leary notes that it’s more important to be respected than well-liked. His leadership strategy revolves around leading his business partners forward in their careers, making them lots of money, and helping them achieve their goals. It might require some tough love, but the most successful people he’s worked with, including Jobs, aren’t hung up on being enjoyable.\n\n“I don’t think that’s certainly how Jobs operated, and so I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about that stuff,” O’Leary says. “I know a lot of people don’t like me because I’m blunt and I tell the truth—I don’t really care. It’s the truth today, it’s the truth next week, it’s the truth in six months. You’re gonna deal with it anyways.”\n\nMoments Jobs proved his success required ruling with an iron fist\n\nJobs was well known for creating tense work environments, but after all, diamonds are made under pressure. As a perfectionist who loved to micromanage his employees, even the smallest perceived error could have resulted in a tirade. For instance, staffers on his Macintosh team were once berated for having improper spacing in the system’s interface. The devil is in the details—and now there are more than 100 million Macs in use.\n\n“It created a high-pressure environment,” Chris Neck, professor of management at Arizona State University, wrote about Jobs’ intense leadership style. “He pushed the original Mac team with impossible deadlines, often clashing with engineers but producing a revolutionary product.” Neck noted that this abrasive approach lost Apple some key talents, such as Macintosh computer designer Jef Raskin, who decided to leave the company in 1982.\n\nEven when Jobs was pursuing other projects outside of Apple, he had that same trademark intensity. Jobs was one of the three founding fathers of Pixar Animation Studios, after having purchased the group from LucasFilm in 1986. But to get iconic films like Finding Nemo and Toy Story off the page and onto movie screens worldwide, he put staffers under an intense work schedule. No one wants to be woken up to their boss calling them at 3 a.m.—but picking up the phone wasn’t optional with Jobs on the other end of the line.\n\n“He would call—especially the producers—at any time, day or night, three in the morning, you’re on vacation, doesn’t matter,” Pete Docter, chief creative officer at Pixar who formerly worked under Jobs, said at Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies Gala this year. “He wants to talk to you about it, you’re on.”\n\nO’Leary told Fortune that he thought Jobs’ leadership style was “something else”—but he admired how he was able to command teams, keep his eye on the prize, and stay in that “signal” mode. It’s a mindset and strategy that’s infectious to work with, he says.\n\n“I’m not saying I liked him that much, but damn, I respected him. Because he had incredible execution skills—he could say, ‘I’m going to get from here to there, and get it done.’ He didn’t give a damn who got in his way,” O’Leary reminisces.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:05.056555+00:00"}

It was knocked from the top thanks to a lack of growth and innovation, but it was still a best-in-class operator that was well managed.\n\nAs of Apple's most recent results, the issue of lack of growth has been resolved, as Apple managed to post its quickest growth rate in years. But is it enough to make Apple a solid stock to buy now?\n\nApple is behind in AI\n\nApple is the leading consumer tech brand in the U.S., and it is also popular around the world. It rose to this position through continuous innovation and always having some of the best products available. However, it has fallen behind in a key area: Artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIt's no secret that Apple Intelligence (Apple's take on AI) hasn't lived up to the hype, and has failed to launch several key features that it promised would be launched last year. Whether these features will make a difference in selling more phones is up for debate, but this is just one area where Apple has fallen behind recently.\n\nCEO Tim Cook hinted at one way Apple may be open to catching up in the AI race: Acquisitions. On Apple's third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call (ending June 28), Cook mentioned that management is open to making an AI acquisition, and is not concerned about the size of the company. Depending on which company Apple scoops up, this could propel Apple from an AI laggard to an AI leader, and could be the next technological innovation it needs to get back on top.\n\nApple's revenue growth lags compared to its peers\n\nEven without AI, Apple's growth has finally returned. In Q3, Apple's revenue was up 10% year over year. While that's not rapid growth by any means, it's at least market-matching and is a big improvement from where it has been.\n\nIf Apple can continue this trend and return to mid-teens growth, Apple could finally start to justify its valuation.\n\nEven though Apple's growth has been lackluster over the past few years, it still maintains a premium valuation in the market. The argument was that Apple is Apple, and it will eventually return to growth mode. Still, despite Apple's successful quarter, it remains a pricey stock.\n\nAt 31 times trailing earnings and 28 times forward earnings, Apple's stock still trades at the high end of its range over the past four years. Furthermore, Apple is more expensive than the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which trades for 25 times trailing earnings and 24 times forward earnings.\n\nAdditionally, if you compare Apple to its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, it also looks rather expensive for its growth.\n\nCompany Last Quarter Revenue Growth Rate Forward P/E Ratio Apple 9.6% 27.5 Nvidia 69.2% 41.4 Microsoft 18.1% 34.0 Amazon 13.3% 32.5 Alphabet 13.8% 19.7 Meta Platforms 21.3% 27.6 Tesla (11.8%) 183.0\n\nCompanies like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) provide better growth at a cheaper or similar price tag.

The question now is whether Apple’s underlying strengths are enough to sustain this momentum and drive its share price higher. Let’s take a closer look:\n\nWeekly Apple Share – Source: ActivTrades’ Online Trading Platform\n\nFrom Asia to America: Inside Apple’s Shift Amid Tariff Pressure\n\nThe Trump administration has escalated its push for American technology manufacturing, announcing a plan to impose roughly 100% tariffs on all semiconductor chips imported into the United States. However, tech companies committing to domestic production will be exempt — a significant reprieve for Apple and other electronics manufacturers that have long relied on global supply chains.\n\nFor years, Apple’s assembly lines and component sourcing have been concentrated in China, India, and Vietnam. The administration is unequivocally warning that companies must reshore production or be subjected to steep new trade barriers. The political backdrop is also shifting, with Trump recently increasing tariffs on India — a country where Apple assembles most of the iPhones sold in the U.S.\n\nIn response, Apple has pledged to dramatically scale up its U.S. presence, committing $600 billion in domestic investment over the next four years. This $100 billion plan builds on an earlier $500 billion commitment made earlier this year. Central to the initiative is a new American Manufacturing Program, aimed at fostering the repatriation of production by Apple’s suppliers and partners. Apple anticipates this program will directly result in 20,000 new jobs and indirectly support additional employment throughout its extended supply network.\n\nCEO Tim Cook underscored Apple’s commitment, stating, “We’re going to keep making investments right here in America, keep hiring in America, and keep building technologies at the heart of our products right here in America because we’re a proud American company, and we believe deeply in the promise of this great nation.”\n\nPart of Apple’s plan is to create a U.S.-based chip supply chain. The company expects to produce more than 19 billion chips in 2025, manufactured across 24 factories in 12 states. This is a strategic move to secure critical components against future trade shocks and aligns with Washington’s push for semiconductor independence. Apple plans to expand its U.S. manufacturing effort with companies like Corning, Texas Instruments, and Amkor Technology among others.\n\nHowever, the challenges are considerable. Industry experts warn that large-scale electronics assembly in the U.S. is hindered by higher labor costs, a shortage of skilled manufacturing workers, and the fact that many key suppliers remain in Asia. Fully assembling iPhones in the United States is unlikely in the near term. Instead, Apple will focus on manufacturing high-value components domestically while continuing to assemble final products overseas — a compromise the Trump administration appears to accept for now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:08.683882+00:00"}

But it could be a net positive as the company looks for ways to increase its sales and grow on the momentum of its promising fiscal third-quarter earnings report.\n\nApple and President Donald Trump made the announcement on Wednesday, Aug. 6, which is the same day that the White House announced a series of new tariffs against dozens of countries to take effect on Thursday. Tariffs have been a concern for Apple stock because the company makes most of its celebrated iPhones in China. While it had made plans to move some production to India, Trump has loudly proclaimed that he wants iPhone manufacturing to be in the U.S. instead.\n\nThe announcement falls short of actually building smartphones in the U.S., but it does include concrete plans and partnerships to manufacture several components used in iPhones domestically. Through the creation of Apple's American Manufacturing Program, the company is bringing more supply chain and advanced manufacturing resources to the U.S.\n\nApple announced that initial partners in the program include Corning, Coherent, GlobalWafers America, Applied Materials, Texas Instruments, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, Amkor Technology, and Broadcom. Previously, Apple had also committed to buying rare earth materials from MP Materials.\n\nExamples of the partnership, according to Apple, is that it will use Corning glass products for its iPhones and Apple Watches, and will work with Coherent to source the VCSEL lasers needed for facial recognition and other services. Apple also says it will use GlobalWafers to produce chips for iPhones and iPads, with the products being fabricated by Texas Instruments and by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's Arizona plant.\n\n\"Apple engineers work closely with suppliers across the United States to create silicon chips that are on the leading edge of innovation,\" Apple Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan said. \"We're committed to supporting U.S. suppliers involved in every key stage of the chip-making process -- from the earliest stages of research and development, to final fabrication and packaging. We want America to lead in this critical industry, and we're expanding our efforts to grow a silicon manufacturing ecosystem that will benefit innovators across America.\"\n\nThe market reacted positively to the announcement, as Apple stock jumped 5% on Wednesday.\n\nA turnaround for Apple stock?\n\nInvestors are obviously hoping that this, coupled with Apple's most recent earnings report, will spark a fire under Apple stock and finally get it moving higher. While other tech stocks are booming, Apple has been relatively flat, rising less than 2% in the last 12 months. Its annual revenue, which helped make Apple the biggest publicly traded company in the world for nearly two decades, flattened in the last three years.\n\nNow both Nvidia and Microsoft top Apple in the rankings of largest companies, with Alphabet and Amazon rapidly closing the gap.\n\nHowever, investors finally got some good news on July 31, when Apple reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings (ended June 28). Revenue jumped 10% to $94 billion, and earnings per share were up 12% to $1.57. Product sales were up 8.2%, which was a vast improvement from the 2.7% increase that Apple saw in the fiscal second quarter.\n\nRegarding Wednesday's announcement, Apple isn't the first tech company to promote U.S. manufacturing to avoid tariff issues. TSMC, which is the world's largest fabricator for high-level semiconductors that power generative artificial intelligence platforms, is investing $165 billion in Arizona to create a research and development center, two advanced packaging facilities, and three fabricators. The work is widely viewed as a hedge to avoid being penalized by future tariffs.\n\nIt's unclear so far how Apple's announcement will affect the cost of products. While Apple's Services division continues to grow and has a far higher profit margin, Apple continues to get the lion's share of its revenue from its products, including smartphones, Macbooks, iPads, and wearable devices.\n\nShould you invest in Apple stock?\n\nApple has been a disappointment of late, but there's real momentum here that the company can use to make a change. The company is also fairly valued, with a recent price-to-earnings ratio of 32, which is reasonable for tech stocks.\n\nApple's announcement should be enough to keep it out of the White House's disapproval. Whether it's enough to keep Apple customers buying its products and help Apple continue to grow its quarterly revenue is another question.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:11.121075+00:00"}

However, the company has seemingly taken a step back in the past few years as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has boosted the value of many other big tech companies.\n\nIn the past three years, Apple's stock is only up around 30%, making it the second-worst performer of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks (trailing only Tesla) and underperforming the S&P 500. That's not something investors are used to seeing from Apple.\n\nDespite Apple seemingly lagging behind, there could possibly be a breath of fresh air coming to the company, sparking new life into the stock.\n\nA much-needed rebound for the iPhone and Mac products\n\nApple's fiscal third-quarter earnings, for the period ended June 28, were a pleasant surprise for many people. Its revenue grew nearly 10% year over year to $94 billion, which is a June quarter record for the iPhone maker. And speaking of iPhone, the smartphone's revenue grew 13% year over year to $44.6 billion, which Apple noted was driven by the popularity of the iPhone 16 family.\n\nMac (which includes products like MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, and Mac Studio) revenue grew 15% year over year to $8 billion, but iPad and wearables, home, and accessories sales were noticeably down -- 8% and 9% year over year, respectively.\n\nStill, Apple's hardware revenue grew by 8% year over year and accounted for nearly 71% of its total revenue for the quarter. Apple's services segment reached an all-time high, bringing in $27.4 billion, but hardware remains -- and will likely remain -- king for the company.\n\nApple's year-over-year revenue growth was its highest in the past three years.\n\nIs Apple finally getting serious about AI?\n\nThe big cloud hanging over Apple's business has been AI (what it calls \"Apple Intelligence\"), and the lack of urgency in the space compared to rivals like Alphabet and Microsoft. It seems Apple is beginning to take it more seriously and address this issue.\n\nA major advantage on Apple's side is the number of devices it has in people's pockets, homes, and offices. Ideally, Apple can integrate AI into its various hardware, giving people even more of a reason to choose it over competitors. This has been the plan for a while, but it hasn't gone as smoothly or as quickly as most people thought or hoped.\n\nThat should change soon, with Apple's management noting on its latest earnings call that Apple is \"increasing [its] investment significantly in AI,\" both in infrastructure and company personnel. In its latest quarter, Apple spent nearly $3.5 billion on capital expenditures, its most since its fiscal quarter that ended in January 2023.\n\nApple has always moved cautiously and with intention. These new AI investment developments don't strike me as the company just now coming to its senses, but more so Apple feeling like now is the right time (a lagging stock price sure helps it come to that realization).\n\nApple's stock looks like a good entry point for investors\n\nAt the time of this writing, Apple is trading at 29 times its projected earnings for the next year. That's the second-lowest out of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks and below the 35 it was at to start this year.\n\nThat alone doesn't make Apple a buy right now, but it does give it a lot more upside now than before. This is especially true if its new AI prioritization plays out as management envisions. With $133 billion in cash and marketable securities to its name, Apple has all the resources it needs to ensure it keeps pace in the AI race.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:19.170336+00:00"}

The chips — Nvidia’s H20 AI accelerator and AMD’s MI308 chips — were earlier banned by the Trump administration and require export licenses to sell.\n\n“To call this unusual or unprecedented would be a staggering understatement,” said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator now with the Singapore-based ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute. “What we are seeing is in effect the monetization of US trade policy in which US companies must pay the US government for permission to export. If that’s the case, we’ve entered into a new and dangerous world.”\n\nThe chip-payment arrangement is the latest legally questionable, heavy-handed government intervention into business since US President Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office in January. Along with his chaotic tariff campaign and persistent criticism of a sitting Federal Reserve chairman, Trump has used his Truth Social platform for everything from calling on CEOs to resign to offering commentary on corporate advertising campaigns.\n\nTrump’s transactional policy approach saw him approve the sale of United States Steel Corp. to Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp. in a $14.1 billion deal that included caveats such as agreeing to US national security rules and a “golden share” for the US government. Japan, South Korea and the European Union all pledged to invest billions in the US, helping secure tariff rates of 15%, while companies such as Apple Inc. have also skirted levies by promising to invest hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nThe Nvidia and AMD revenue-sharing deals may now prompt the White House to target other industries and goods, according to Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore.\n\n“The sky is the limit,” she said. “You could come up with all sorts of company-specific, country-specific combinations that would say, ‘No one else can trade, but if you pay us directly, then you get the ability to trade.’”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:34:45.741459+00:00"}

But lately, it's been falling behind its competitors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot theme for tech in recent years, and Apple has been taking a slow and perhaps overly conservative approach to deploying next-gen technologies for its iPhones.\n\nInvestors haven't been pleased with the strategy, and the stock has been doing poorly in what's otherwise been a strong year for the markets. As of the end of Aug. 7, the stock was down more than 12% from the start of the year, while the S&P 500 has risen by nearly 8%.\n\nBut there have been whispers and signs that the company may be looking to appease investors and make a big move, one that could help it catch up to its rivals in AI. Could a big acquisition be on the horizon for Apple?\n\nTim Cook hints at M&A to speed up its AI strategy\n\nThere are so many chatbots and AI-powered products and services in the market these days that it can be difficult to keep up. Apple has been playing catch-up, and while it has been introducing AI features for its iPhones, it delayed some until next year, particularly for its Siri assistant. The problem is that by then, it risks falling even further behind its rivals.\n\nBut the company does have substantial resources it can put toward a big acquisition to bolster its strategy. As of June 28, the company's cash and marketable securities totaled more than $55 billion. And over the past nine months, it has generated nearly $82 billion in cash from its day-to-day operating activities.\n\nCEO Tim Cook recently said that the company may be willing to put that money to work and that he's open to mergers & acquisitions (M&A). \"We're very open to M&A that accelerates our roadmap,\" he said.\n\nAnd what was particularly noteworthy was that he may have hinted that even a large deal may be a possibility, stating that \"we are not stuck on a certain size company.\"\n\nEarlier this year, there were rumors that the company was looking into acquiring Perplexity, which has a popular chatbot and would equip Apple with a load of AI talent. While nothing has materialized and nothing may come of it, a move like that could certainly help Apple win over AI investors.\n\nInvestors shouldn't be worried about Apple in the long run\n\nApple has a robust business, a vast ecosystem of products and services, and more than 1.5 billion active iPhone users around the globe. And don't forget its massive cash flow. The company is by no means in imminent danger.\n\nThe company has been taking it easy in recent years and has typically been cautious in its growth, opting to make small, incremental changes to its iPhones rather than big, revolutionary ones. But I think that's because it hasn't had to do that or worry about that. Its users are entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, where it isn't easy to just switch to another provider, as doing so would be a significant undertaking.\n\nWith AI, however, management may finally be pushed to be a bit more aggressive. And even if it's behind the competition right now, all it takes is one big move or acquisition to change that. I wouldn't worry about Apple in the long run, as the business still looks phenomenal, and with deep pockets, it has plenty of options it can consider.\n\nShould you buy Apple stock right now?\n\nA big acquisition for Apple may or may not happen, and it's risky to invest based on rumors. But as one of the world's largest and most iconic tech companies, this still looks like a good stock to invest in for the long haul.\n\nAt more than 30 times its trailing earnings, it isn't all that cheap. And it may be a volatile road ahead for the company, as it has to worry about tariffs. A slowdown in the economy could impact demand for its products as well. But if you're looking for a stock to invest in for the long term (e.g., 10-plus years), Apple can be a great option to consider.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:34:47.482559+00:00"}

Trump posted in Truth Social that any court order against his tariff policies could be disastrous as “It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION.” Trump’s reciprocal tariffs were effective at mid-night Aug 7. Trump also claimed that the imposition of tariffs by his administration would have a “huge positive impact” on the market.\n\nApple Soars Last Week\n\nLast week, technology behemoth Apple Inc. AAPL recorded its best weekly performance since July 2020. On Aug 6, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook met President Trump at the White House where the company pledged to invest approximately $600 billion in the United States over the next four years.

(Credit: ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images files)\n\nThe S&P 500 is often viewed as a diversified benchmark, representing a broad cross-section of the U.S. economy. But today, that perception is increasingly misleading. The index has never been more concentrated in just a few names than it is right now which introduces risks investors can’t afford to ignore.\n\nNvidia Corp. alone currently represents nearly eight per cent of the S&P 500, the highest weighting for a single stock in the index’s history. Nvidia and Microsoft Corp. together account for nearly 15 per cent, and adding Apple Inc. brings the top three to 21 per cent. The top 10 stocks now make up a record 40 per cent of the index, surpassing the 27 per cent peak seen during the dot-com bubble in 2000. Yet these companies only generate about 30 per cent of the index’s total earnings, highlighting a growing disconnect between price and fundamentals.\n\nThe illusion of diversification\n\nWhen a handful of companies dominate index performance, the illusion of broad-based strength can mask growing fragility beneath the surface. In a well-diversified market, a negative surprise from a single company — such as an earnings miss or regulatory issue — would typically remain contained. But in today’s environment, a stumble by one of these giants can ripple across the entire market. Passive flows and algorithmic trading amplify such moves, turning what should be an isolated event into broader volatility.\n\nThis dynamic blurs the line between idiosyncratic and systemic risk. It’s not that systemic volatility originates from concentration but rather that concentration makes the system more fragile, allowing localized shocks to cascade through the broader market.\n\nHistory may not repeat, but it does rhyme\n\nWe’ve seen this movie before. In the 1970s, the “Nifty Fifty” stocks were considered bulletproof. Investors paid sky-high multiples for perceived quality and growth. But when inflation surged and growth slowed, many of these stocks collapsed, dragging the broader market down with them.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the dot-com bubble saw tech stocks dominate the S&P 500. Companies with little revenue and no profits traded at astronomical valuations. When the bubble burst in 2000, the Nasdaq lost nearly 80 per cent of its value, and the S&P 500 entered a multi-year bear market.\n\nEven the FAANG era of the 2010s — referring to Facebook (now Meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet) — showed signs of fragility.\n\nWhile those companies were profitable and innovative, their dominance masked weakness in other sectors. When tech sentiment cooled in 2022, the broader market suffered despite strength in areas like energy and industrials.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:58:01.748638+00:00"}

Bitcoin funds have seen eight weeks of net inflows in the past nine, adding roughly $10 billion over that period, nearly 20% of the $54 billion they’ve pulled in since launching in January 2024.\n\nEthereum funds are also moving fast, with $460 million flowing into spot Ether ETFs on Friday alone, the fourth-biggest day on record.\n\nETF Store president Nate Geraci noted on X that “eight of the top 10 Ether inflow days, including all of the top five, have happened in just the past month.”\n\nFinally, a softer macro backdrop is fuelling rate-cut bets in the US.\n\n“Weaker-than-expected economic data from the US has spurred investors’ beliefs that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting,” Simon Peters, crypto analyst at eToro, said in comments shared with DL News.\n\nHe added that this could “cause further tailwinds to cryptoasset prices and take the total market capitalisation higher.”\n\nFutures markets now see an 88% chance of a Federal Reserve cut in September, a shift reminiscent of late 2024’s “rate cut rush” that doubled Bitcoin’s price in just four months.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin has gained 2.6% in value over the past 24 hours and is trading at $121,285.\n\nEthereum is up 1% in the same period to $4,255.\n\nWhat we’re reading\n\nKyle Baird is DL News’ Weekend Editor.

Discover SCENE\n\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak has accused YouTube of failing to act against a Bitcoin scam that used his likeness, warning the same lax systems are now enabling a surge in global deepfake fraud.\n\n“Some people said they lost their life savings,” Wozniak told CBS News. “That’s a crime. A good person, if you see a crime happening, you step in and try to stop it.”\n\nWozniak found out he had been impersonated in scam ads several years earlier and is still fighting a 2020 case in court against YouTube for its lack of action in taking down the content.\n\nThe Apple co-founder said he discovered the scam after his wife, Janet, received an email from a victim asking when they would get their money back.\n\nThe scammers had \"actually taken video of Woz talking about Bitcoin,\" Janet explained. \"Then they put a nice frame around it with a Bitcoin address, and said that if you sent him any amount of Bitcoin, he would send you double that back.\"\n\n\"Look at spam, look at the phishing attempts just all over the place,\" Wozniak said. \"And there's not enough real, I don't know, muscle to fight it.\"\n\nDeepfake fraud on the rise\n\nWozniak’s warning comes amid an explosion in AI-generated deepfakes and increasing online fraud. Some $9.3 billion was lost to online scams in 2024, according to reports made to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The real total is likely far higher.\n\nTech leaders from Elon Musk to Jeff Bezos have seen their likenesses hijacked in similar scams, while critics say major platforms remain slow to act. A lack of robust moderation and oversight for online ads, especially on social media and video platforms, has allowed spammy, misleading, and outright fraudulent content to flourish.\n\nWozniak's criticism of YouTube echoes that of UK Liberal Democrat MP Max Wilkinson, who last week called for ads on the platform to be regulated to the same standards as television and radio in the UK.\n\n“Regulations need to catch up with the reality of how people are watching content,” Wilkinson said, warning that “unscrupulous advertisers must not be allowed to use loopholes to exploit people.”\n\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, told Decrypt it removed over 5.1 billion ads and restricted another 9.1 billion in 2024, suspended 39.2 million advertiser accounts for major violations, and blocked ads on 1.3 billion publisher pages.\n\nThe company said it has strict ad policies, invests heavily in enforcement, and has thousands of people working around the clock to police its platforms.\n\nIt's not the only tech company that has come in for criticism of its content moderation abilities.

Meta Platforms (META 0.30%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.42%), Amazon (AMZN -0.33%), and Apple (AAPL -1.55%) all reported second-quarter earnings, and while they were mostly positive in different ways, artificial intelligence (AI) continued to be a strong trend. That's great news for Nvidia (NVDA -0.66%) investors. Let's see what's happening and why investors should get excited about what Nvidia will have to say when it reports quarterly earnings later this month.\n\nWinning with AI\n\nAI has become an enormous growth driver for tech companies, and really all kinds of companies. It unlocks productivity and aids in creativity in ways that make it essential if a company doesn't want to be left behind.\n\nAmazon said that its AI business through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division continues to grow at triple digits year over year, \"with more demand than we have supplied for at the moment.\" It's launching all sorts of new features as demand grows and changes, and releasing powerful new tools aimed at developers creating large language models and in need of the highest-power AI chips. It also boasted that it rolled out new EC2 instances, a type of virtual server on the AWS cloud supported by new Nvidia Blackwell \"super chips,\" the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) on AWS.\n\nAmazon spent $31.4 billion on capital expenditures, which it says is a reasonable estimate for the back half of the year. Although that could be in many parts of the business, it said the AI business is where most of it is going. That means it could be spending even more than the original $100 billion it said it would spend in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft boasted that its Azure cloud business is grabbing market share, up 34% year over year in the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter (ended June 30), and that it now has 400 data centers, the most of any other cloud business. Management highlighted that while there's industry talk about the first gigawatt or multi-gigawatt data centers, it launched two gigawatts of power in its data centers over the past 12 months, and it's scaling faster than the competition.\n\nAt Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed many exciting developments in AI, including the launch of Meta Superintelligence Labs, which combines all of the company's AI efforts, and progress on upgrades to its Llama LLMs. In April, Nvidia announced its own involvement in the new Llama developments. Zuckerberg said Meta is working on the next generation of products \"that will push the frontier in the next\n\nyear or so.\" Meta has made headlines over the last few weeks as it crafts a team of AI specialists it's been pulling from rival companies.\n\nApple continues to disappoint, or at least confuse, investors with its AI developments. It's taking its time to develop an AI infrastructure that rivals the competition, and it's questionable whether or not it's losing ground or if it's going to eventually release something different and special, which is its signature. Management said it's making substantial investments in AI and that its capital expenditures are going to increase.\n\nAlthough investors seemed disappointed in Apple's AI updates, there's no question that it provided an excellent report, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines, and it's likely to report progress in Apple Intelligence over the coming quarters.\n\nDriving AI\n\nThe common denominator here is Nvidia, which partners with all of these companies. It provides the power for Amazon's and Microsoft's clientele to develop potent LLMs and AI agents, and they also use Nvidia GPUs for the data centers that drive their own LLMs. Meta uses Nvidia's GPUs for its own LLMs and AI agents, and Apple partners with Nvidia for its AI business as well.\n\nNvidia is guiding for sales to increase about 50% over last year in the fiscal second quarter, which it will report on Aug. 27. Its quarterly results usually beat guidance, but with the success and continued capital investments of its top-tier clients, it's very likely that it will beat sales guidance and give shareholders a strong outlook.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T13:50:11.564121+00:00"}
{"id": "653db771-1f54-3e19-8146-367bed119190", "ticker": "AAPL", "title": "Where Will Apple Be in 1 Year?", "summary": "The leader in consumer electronics has made for a terrible investment in 2025.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/09/where-will-apple-be-in-1-year/", "published_at": "2025-08-09T10:35:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "The leader in consumer electronics has made for a terrible investment in 2025.\n\nApple (AAPL -1.19%) just reported third-quarter 2025 (ended June 28) financial results that pleased investors. Revenue soared 9.6% year over year to $94 billion, while diluted earnings per share climbed 12.1%. These headline figures beat Wall Street estimates.\n\nDespite the upbeat results, Apple shares have disappointed. They're down 15% in 2025 (as of Aug. 6). And in the last 12 months, they are essentially flat. The S&P 500 index is up 22% during the same time. This trend doesn't inspire confidence among the investment community.\n\nBut maybe the future will bring optimism. Where will this consumer discretionary stock be one year from now?\n\nLeaning into the AI opportunity\n\nThe general view is that Apple has so far fallen behind in the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) race. Apple Intelligence, its AI system that's integrated with its devices and software, has launched 20 different features for users. But it hasn't exactly had that wow factor that people are accustomed to seeing from Apple.\n\nThere was also supposed to be an AI-powered Siri launching in late 2024. However, this more personalized voice assistant won't be introduced until sometime in 2026. Big tech peers have gone full steam ahead in the meantime, while it appears that Apple is playing catch-up.\n\nOn the latest earnings call, though, CEO Tim Cook gave investors a reason to be bullish. \"We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime,\" he said on the Q3 2025 earnings call. Maybe he's finally starting to regard AI as a serious paradigm shift that can have huge implications for his business.\n\nApple is raising the amount of money it's spending on AI-related capital expenditures (capex). CFO Kevan Parekh said capex spending \"is going to grow substantially.\" In Q3, the company's capex totaled $3.5 billion. Mergers and acquisitions could be part of the plan.\n\nTherefore, investors shouldn't be surprised for Apple to push more aggressively into AI initiatives. This seems to be the right move from a strategic perspective. At the end of the day, it's all about Apple being able to bolster its competitive position. It's hard to say what new products or services will come next from this.\n\nIt's also difficult to see any meaningful effect on the company's financials. For Apple, this means being able to sell more devices and simultaneously grow the services segment. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Apple's revenue will rise 6.3% in fiscal 2025 and 4.8% in fiscal 2026.\n\nMaking accurate predictions is hard\n\nIt can be a valuable exercise for investors to understand the current situation that a business is in, as well as what the near future might hold. However, making correct predictions about the direction of a stock is almost impossible to do. There are so many variables at play.\n\nFor what it's worth, the consensus price target for Apple shares is $233.61, which implies 10.9% upside from today's price. That would certainly be an improvement from the last 12 months' performance. It's a gain that I wouldn't be surprised by.\n\nBut investors looking at Apple shouldn't make a decision based on what could happen over the next 12 months. Instead, it's worth assessing whether or not this is a business that you'd want to own for the next five years. That's the proper way to invest, with a long-term mindset.\n\nRight now, Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31.9. That's a high valuation to pay for a company whose growth is harder to come by these days.

It has been outpaced every step of the way by its Android competitors. Additionally, the gap only seems to be getting wider and wider. However, Apple may be implementing a new strategy that could be a genius move.\n\nOn the conference call for the fiscal third quarter of 2025, ended June 28, Apple CEO Tim Cook commented about the company's new AI strategy, and it may be enough to vault Apple from an AI laggard to an AI leader.\n\nApple could be open to acquiring a generative AI company\n\nDuring Apple's quarterly conference call, Cook said Apple is open to acquiring an AI company. If it acquired an AI leader, then it could rapidly accelerate its development pace. He also mentioned that it's not focused on a specific size, which could indicate management could be going after one of the larger generative AI companies.\n\nSome of the businesses on the short list that Apple could acquire are OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic. These three tend to be among the best generative AI models that aren't already associated with a parent company (like xAI's Grok or Google's Gemini). However, an acquisition for these wouldn't come cheap.\n\nAll three of these companies are currently private, so we have relatively limited data to establish the value of the company. According to the most recent reports for each company, OpenAI was last valued at $300 billion, Anthropic at $170 billion, and Perplexity at $18 billion. At the end of Q3, Apple's cash and short-term investments totaled over $55 billion.\n\nSo, while it could probably flex its muscle and scoop up OpenAI or Anthropic at an extreme price tag, an acquisition of a company like Perplexity is probably more likely. This also would make the most sense, as OpenAI is currently partnered with Microsoft and Anthropic is linked to Amazon.\n\nWith Perplexity's relatively low valuation compared to its peers, Apple could scoop it up in an all-cash deal and immediately be in a great position in the AI arms race. I wouldn't be surprised to see a deal like this get announced within the next year, and it may not be with Perplexity; it could be with another generative AI competitor.\n\nHowever, I think this route is likely as Apple has already fallen well behind its peers in this realm. But the question is, does Apple need AI to sell its products?\n\nApple's revenue growth is already returning despite its AI product lineup\n\nDuring Q3, Apple did something it hasn't done in some time: produce double-digit revenue growth (as long as you round up).\n\nApple has been stuck in a rut since 2022, and now it's finally showing some signs of life, despite having little AI featured compared to its peers. The question then becomes: Do AI features matter to consumers? This could be a hotly debated topic, as most users likely aren't using the AI capabilities of Android phones, and Apple users may not care.\n\nBut there could be a time someday when users are comfortable using AI features, and the specific AI model on a phone becomes a huge selling point. We're not there yet, so Apple still has some time to catch up in the AI arms race. However, we'll reach that point eventually, and if Apple doesn't do something major, like acquire an AI company, it could be left in the dust over the long term, even if it isn't feeling the pain right now.\n\nI think Apple's new strategy could be genius if it makes a move to acquire a company like Perlexity, and the entire investment thesis surrounding Apple would improve overnight. But if it fails to do so, Apple could be on the outside looking in a few years from now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T13:50:15.899470+00:00"}

The Institute for Supply Management’s index of services declined last month to 50.1, below all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

Well, yes, that’s technically true, but it’s not very exciting or interesting. What’s symbolically bigger and better than $4 trillion? $5 trillion? There we go; now, we’re talking.\n\nLast month, chipmaker Nvidia became the first company in the world to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Currently valued at roughly $4.4 trillion, it achieved the landmark a little more than three years after tech giant Apple became the first $3 trillion company in 2022. Now, a seemingly two-horse race for the first-place $5 trillion trophy is underway.\n\nTale of the Market Tape\n\nTemporarily joining Nvidia, which achieved the landmark on July 10, was Microsoft, which became the second member of the $4 trillion club on July 31 after blowing past earnings expectations. But it exited shortly thereafter, with shares softening enough to bring its market cap back down to $3.9 trillion as of Friday.\n\nAnticipating that both companies would reach $4 trillion, Wedbush analysts wrote in June that they could reach the $5 trillion landmark in the next 18 months, noting the “tech bull market is still early, being led by the AI Revolution.” Both happen to be benefiting from overlapping tailwinds. Microsoft’s Azure is growing at breakneck speed as it has become the leading cloud platform for workplaces. The company’s cloud revenues for its latest fiscal year, which ended on July 31, rose 23% year-over-year to $168 billion. Meanwhile, the cloud computing surge that Microsoft has benefited from, of course, has increased the demand for computing hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia. Demand for hardware to support AI computing has, naturally, led to more promising growth in demand: All told, Nvidia predicted at its March technology conference in San Jose, capital expenditures on data centers will rise to $1 trillion by 2028 from $400 billion last year. As for who will hit $5 trillion with the wind in its sails first, the odds seem to favor the chipmaker:\n\nMicrosoft does earn more money. Net income in its fiscal year ending June 30 was $101.8 billion. Nvidia’s net income for the 12 months ending April 30 was a lesser $76.8 billion — but this ultimately impressive haul was achieved as the United States revoked the company’s license to export to China. (Nvidia is poised to reenter the market after the Trump administration offered assurances last month that it will be granted licenses again.)\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, is growing faster. In Microsoft’s latest quarter ending June 30, net income rose 24% year-over-year to $27 billion, and revenue climbed 18% to $76.4 billion. Nvidia’s net income in its latest quarter ending April 30 increased 26% to $18.7 billion, and revenue jumped 69% to $44 billion. And, again, it achieved that growth even with the ban on Chinese chip exports.\n\nThe Dark Horses: The only other companies with a current market cap above $2 trillion are Apple ($3.4 trillion), Google-owner Alphabet ($2.4 trillion) and Amazon ($2.4 trillion). But, unless Tim Cook rolls up to Apple’s next Worldwide Developers Conference with an iPhone that can teleport you to the French Riviera on your lunch break, these thoroughbreds are likely to remain dark horses.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T14:54:21.721500+00:00"}

Further announcements around duties since then and continued uncertainty over Trump's future tariff plans loom over markets, as the second half of the year gets underway.\n\nThis was followed by pauses on the US implementing higher tariffs on certain trading partners, extending the deadline by which they had to negotiate trade deals, which offered some relief to investors.\n\nUS president Donald Trump's unveiling of sweeping tariffs on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\" on 2 April also rocked the Mag 7, as well as markets more broadly.\n\nThese questions were front of mind when going into the first earnings season of the year, in addition to increasingly high expectations from investors as to what to expect from the performance of these companies.\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cheaper AI model in January raised questions over the level of spending on the technology by the major US companies and rattled investors.\n\nThe latest earnings season has been another test for the group, some of which had recovered more recently following a turbulent start to 2025.\n\nMany of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants have now reported their latest quarterly earnings, with the results receiving a mixed response from investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Tesla’s headwinds are getting worse and investors are becoming less enamoured with the business.\n\n“Competition is fierce, tariffs are biting, the end of tax credits for electric vehicle buyers in the US could hurt, Elon Musk’s political escapades have been a turn-off for many people, and product innovation has failed to make waves.\"\n\nCEO Elon Musk's public feud with US president Donald Trump, following his departure from the Department of Government Efficiency, has weighed on Tesla shares. · Chesnot via Getty Images\n\n\"A push into more affordable vehicles implies a drop in profit margins, while the hope of being big in self-driving cars remains a fantasy rather than reality,\" said Mould. \"The Cybertruck product line hasn’t filled the treasure chest for the company, and for many the Tesla brand has become toxic because of Musk’s outspoken views.\"\n\nTesla shares are already down nearly 18% year-to-date despite rising as CEO Elon Musk stepped back from Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and said he planned to put more time back into the EV company.\n\nMusk's public feud with Trump, following his departure from Washington, has weighed on the stock.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of Tesla vehicles have continued to fall, amid backlash against Musk's political activities, with the company also facing increasing competition from rival EV makers.\n\nIn figures released early in July, Tesla delivered 384,122 vehicles globally in the second quarter, a drop of 13.5% for the same period last year.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) – Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 23 July\n\nSecond-quarter results from Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) topped Wall Street estimates, with revenue of $96.43bn versus expectations of $93.97bn. Earnings were $2.31 per share compared with a Bloomberg consensus estimate of $2.18.\n\nOn a business segment level, advertising revenue came in at $71.3bn versus expectations of $69.6bn. Search revenue topped out at $54.1bn versus an anticipated $52.7bn. YouTube ad revenue was $9.8bn versus expectations of $9.5bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud Platform revenue hit $13.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $13.1bn.\n\nThe company's outlook for capital expenditures (capex), however, was higher than expected. The tech giant expects to spend $85bn in the year, $10bn more than had been previously expected.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nBen Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the concerns around disruption from artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, Alphabet produced a really good set of numbers in its latest results. Revenues were up 15%, three percentage points better than expected and the search business delivered at the top of its range. The cloud business, meanwhile, was also a strong performer with revenues up 32% so it is encouraging to see the business growing strongly in the face of pressures.\"\n\nHe said that the increase in its capex guidance \"is a very solid raise and should be viewed as a positive, with investment looking to drive away the threat of Chat GPT\".\n\n\"Alphabet has been playing catch up somewhat in the AI arms race, but it is doing well to fend off the likes of Chat GPT,\" said Barringer. \"The big question will be whether it can keep innovating at a pace that allows it to maintain its search monopoly. This boost in investment suggests the fight will continue.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the next big event on the horizon for Alphabet's Google is a judge's ruling in an search antitrust case. Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to issue a ruling on \"remedies\" that follows the Justice Department's victory against the company sometime next month.\n\n\"While it is unlikely to be the end of the saga regardless of the result, any indication that its search monopoly will weaken will not be taken well by the market, especially given the AI threat currently,\" said Barringer. \"This ruling has the potential to either be a clearing event or add to Alphabet’s uncertainties. Investors remain very much in wait and see mode as a result and will remain cool on the stock until that ruling makes it clear what the next steps are.\"\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) – Released fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday 30 July\n\nShares in Microsoft (MSFT) popped nearly 5% on Thursday, following the release of its results, seeing it become the second publicly-traded company ever to cross the $4tn market capitalisation mark.\n\nMicrosoft reported revenue of $76.4bn in the fourth quarter compared to expectations of $73.89bn, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $3.65 compared to expectations of $3.37.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes the Azure cloud, produced $29.88bn in revenue in the final quarter. For the entire fiscal year, this AI division saw revenue surge 34% to a record $75bn.\n\nThe company predicted its capital expenditure for the next fiscal year would top $100bn, a 14% increase from the year prior.\n\nRead more: Shell announces further $3.5bn in share buybacks as profits beat estimates\n\nIt’s the fifth quarter in a row that Microsoft has beaten Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nBarringer said that \"while AI demand is clearly helping Microsoft, it isn’t the only game in town for the tech giant. Its cloud business, Azure, saw revenues grow 39%, well ahead of expectations, highlighting that demand for more traditional cloud based services remains strong. Microsoft has a good backlog in this business area too so we should see strong results continue to flow there.\n\n“The company did announce it was slowing the growth of its capex and changing the mix slightly, but as demand remains strong for AI we will likely see the likes of data centres take priority for a number of years yet.\n\nMeta (META) – Released second quarter results on Wednesday 30 July\n\nFacebook-parent Meta (META) surged 12% on Thursday after posting a bumper set of results after the market close on 30 July.\n\nMeta said revenue for the three months to the end of June rose 22% from the same period last year to $47.5bn. Meanwhile, profits jumped by 36% to $18.3bn. Profit per share came in at $7.14, above analysts' estimates.\n\nThe company said it expected its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114bn and $118bn. The company added its AI initiatives will “result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.”\n\n\"I think there are all these questions that people have about what are going to be the timelines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence ... we've observed the more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen. I think that that just continued to happen over the course of this year too,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nReality Labs logged an operating loss of $4.53bn while recording $370m in sales during the same period. This division oversees the Quest line of virtual reality headsets in addition to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company plans to build several massive data centres across the US. · Reuters / Reuters\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Meta has knocked it out of the park. Pick your metric and Meta crushed it, from ad revenue growth to daily users, all the way down to the profit lines.\n\n\"AI is clearly delivering real-world benefits for advertisers, and they're willing to pay more as a result. Average price per ad was up 9% over the quarter, a clear indication that Meta is delivering an improved product for both users and advertisers.\n\n\"The broader focus now turns to Meta's mammoth AI investment plans and whether it can continue to manage those costs without hurting earnings or free cash flow.\n\n\"CFO commentary called out higher costs next year, and another year of similar capex growth, which many analysts did not have on their bingo cards. Clearly, all this spending adds some near-term risks to the bottom line, but Meta looks set to be a clear winner in the AI space over the longer term.\"\n\nApple (AAPL) – Released third-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nInvestors in Apple (AAPL) had a muted response to its latest earnings in after-hours trading following their release, despite a surge in iPhone sales driving record revenue at the Cupertino-based company.\n\nThe company posted better-than-expected 10% growth in revenue year-on-year for the quarter to the end of June and an upbeat forecast.\n\nEarnings of $1.57 per share topped the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $1.43. Revenue of $94.04bn was better than the expected $89.30bn. Mac and iPhone revenue were both better than analysts had anticipated, while wearables and iPad numbers fell short. Greater China revenue was $15.37bn compared to an estimate of $15.19bn.\n\nApple expects tariffs to cost the company $1.1bn this quarter, CEO Tim Cook told investors on the earnings call. That's after the iPhone maker took a tariff-related hit to the tune of $800m during the fiscal third quarter which ran through June.\n\nServices revenue, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Pay, came in at $27.4bn, up about 13% year-on-year, continuing its double-digit growth.\n\nCook said Apple (AAPL) was increasing its AI investments. “We did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter,” he told analysts, without giving specific numbers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook warned in a second quarter earnings call at the beginning of May that tariffs were expected to add $900m to costs in the third quarter. · REUTERS / Reuters\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Britzman said: \"Apple is caught in a sentiment trap. On paper, the company delivered one of its strongest sets of results in recent years – robust iPhone sales, a return to growth in China, and encouraging guidance. Ordinarily, that would send shares meaningfully higher. There’s a sense of unease hanging over Apple, something we haven’t seen in a long time. Scepticism around its AI positioning, combined with lingering tariff uncertainty, continues to weigh on investor confidence.\"\n\n\"Apple should be a leading name in AI hardware, but that’s simply not the case,\" he added. \"Apple Intelligence was a flop, so a lot of hope now lies in an AI-powered Siri – but that might not come until next year. Brand loyalty gives Apple time to get the AI transition right, but it needs to start delivering.\"\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – Released second-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nShares in Amazon (AMZN) fell on the back of its second quarter results, as its outlook for operating income fell short of investor expectations.\n\nThe tech company beat estimates with its revenue up 13.3% year over year to $167.7bn. Market experts had estimated the company would report around $162bn in revenue and 9% growth. The company’s Amazon Web Services cloud computing division reported its sales reached $30.9bn in an increase of 17.5% year over year.\n\nHowever, Amazon projected that operating income in the third quarter would be $15.5bn-$20.5bn, which fell short of analyst expectations of $19.4bn.\n\nChief executive Andy Jassy warned of further uncertainty around Trump’s tariff policies and said he remained “unsure” who would absorb potentially higher costs over time.\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nHe also gave a clear indication that the e-commerce giant will continue its AI push. \"AI is going to be the biggest transformation of our lifetime,” he said during a call with analysts on Thursday. “Every single area of the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by AI.\"\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Just as it looked as if investors were ready to go all-in to big tech again, Amazon has come along and spoiled the party. A negative reaction to its results and a lacklustre response to Apple’s numbers would suggest the market has become more discerning.\"\n\n\"It is spending big on AI infrastructure, leading to more subdued profit guidance than expected,\" he said. \"The retail side of its business is caught up in Trump’s spiderweb of tariffs, which creates ongoing uncertainty.\"\n\n“Competition remains fierce for cloud computing services and Amazon’s sales growth rate is struggling to match rivals Microsoft and Alphabet,\" Coatsworth added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 27 August\n\nAs an enabler of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings have become a major event in the earnings calendar, with some build up to the release of its results as it tends to report later in the season.\n\nInvestor expectations have become increasingly high around Nvidia's earnings, with markets sensitive to any signs of slowdown for the chip giant.\n\nThe stock has seen a marked rebound following turbulence in the first few months of the year amid the DeepSeek AI market shock and Trump's tariff agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed curbs on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China in April. Shares popped last week after the company said that it would resume sales of its H20 chips in China. Nvidia said that the US government had assured the company that licences will be granted, with the chipmaker adding that it hoped to start deliveries soon.\n\nThe recovery in Nvidia shares since mid-April lows has meant the stock is now up 25% year-to-date and recently saw the company become the first publicly traded company to pass the $4tn market capitalisation milestone.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia beat expectations, posting revenue of $44.1bn compared with an expected $43.29bn. The chipmaker guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2% for the second quarter.\n\nGoing into the second-quarter earnings, Britzman warned that investors shouldn't expect \"any meaningful impact\" from the recent turnaround on H20 chip curbs, given the timeframe.\n\n\"However, taking a conservative view, new Chinese sales could drive a $10bn uplift in revenue by year-end, potentially more if things move fast,\" he said. \"NVIDIA may also be able to reverse some of the $4.5bn inventory write-down from the first quarter, providing a direct boost to earnings.\"\n\nHe added: \"Outside of China, overall demand remains critical. Markets have already heard from major customers that data centre expansion is a priority, which should benefit Nvidia.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T15:12:20.807004+00:00"}

The gains came on news that it is hiking its domestic investment in U.S. manufacturing, by $100 billion, to a total $600 billion over the next four years. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook made the formal announcement at the White House with President Donald Trump late Wednesday.\n\nWith the advance on Friday, Apple stock climbed above its 200-day moving average line for the first time since March 10.

Keeping that in mind, here are three industry titans with attractive long-term potential.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nMarket Cap: $3.27 trillion\n\nCreator of the iPhone and App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.\n\nWhy Is AAPL on Our Radar?\n\nApple's revenue base is so large because nearly everyone in the U.S. has an iPhone, but this is a double-edged sword. Growth must now come from upgrades, a harder pitch that has resulted in sluggish top-line performance recently. Still, Apple's devices have endured for decades, speaking to its brand, design ethos, and technological chops. Its success is rare in the world of consumer electronics, which is fraught because of commoditization, competition, and obsolescence risk. The company may not have the best gross margin because of its hardware orientation, but it still manages to produce elite operating and free cash flow margins. This shows it doesn’t need over-the-top marketing campaigns to convince people to buy its products.\n\nAt $228.95 per share, Apple trades at 29.5x forward price-to-earnings. Is now the time to initiate a position? Find out in our full research report, it’s free.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMarket Cap: $3.87 trillion\n\nShort for microcomputer software, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the largest software vendor in the world with its Windows operating system, Office suite, and cloud computing services.\n\nWhy Are We Bullish on MSFT?\n\nMicrosoft is one of the great brands not just in tech but all of business. It produces mission-critical software and bundles it together, resulting in cream-of-the-crop gross margins. The company's elite unit economics lead to robust profit margins that improve over time. This speaks to the scale advantages and operating efficiency across its diverse portfolio, which spans everything from Office and Azure to Minecraft. Microsoft has a virtuous cycle of returns. Its dominant market position enables it to generate strong free cash flow, and it reinvests these funds into promising ventures that further strengthen its competitive moat.\n\nMicrosoft is trading at $521.18 per share, or 34.9x forward price-to-earnings.

While it sounds costly, it's the better alternative to higher tariffs, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note today. Reitzes also reiterated a buy rating on the stock and raised his price target by $20 to $260.\n\n\"It relieves Apple from paying incremental tariffs on U.S.-bound iPhones from India,\" Reitzes said, adding that a stronger iPhone production cycle could begin in the fall. \"We are going to take a risk here and raise our target and our numbers, taking out a huge portion of our tariff hits.\"\n\nOne problem potentially solved\n\nApple's stock has struggled this year because of how much of the company's production is abroad in China, India, and Vietnam. Even after the big run this week, shares are still down about 5.5% on the year.\n\nThe company has also struggled to convince investors that it has a strong road map in place for artificial intelligence. While that challenge remains, removing some of the tariff overhang is certainly a big step in the right direction and allows the company to focus more on its core business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:02:39.604787+00:00"}

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nJamf’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 12 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 6.3% on the news that the White House announced a new round of steep global tariffs, sparking concerns of a trade war and its impact on the U.S. and global economies. This move creates significant uncertainty for businesses and investors. The new tariffs, with rates of up to 41% on imports from 68 countries and the European Union, prompted a broad market sell-off, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index showing notable weakness. Adding to the bearish sentiment was a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which revealed that employers created only 73,000 jobs, far below economists' expectations. This combination of trade fears and signs of a slowing labor market has created a \"risk-off\" environment, leading investors to pull back from growth-oriented sectors like software and technology.\n\nJamf is down 43.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $7.97 per share, it is trading 57.7% below its 52-week high of $18.84 from August 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Jamf’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $202.20.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

Over the past three years, GoDaddy's total shareholder return, including share price appreciation and dividends, was 88.02%. This performance offers a longer-term perspective, although it has underperformed the US market's 22.4% return over the past year and the US IT industry's 26.9% return.\n\nLooking forward, the potential impact on revenue and earnings forecasts may depend on GoDaddy's execution of its pricing and bundling strategy and the success of AI-driven platforms like the Airo platform. With these initiatives, the company aims to enhance growth and customer retention. However, external factors such as economic uncertainty and market competition might impact these projections. The current share price of $150.25 reflects a 41.72% discount to the analyst consensus price target of $212.94.

The Ohio site may also be used for other purposes, a decision which has yet to be made, a person said.\n\nThe two companies, which teamed up to produce SoftBank’s humanoid Pepper robots a decade ago, formed a joint venture this year to build a data center and manufacturing venture in the US, investing $735 million each. It wasn’t immediately clear whether SoftBank’s investment in the venture includes the $375 million for the EV plant.\n\nSoftBank is scouting a number of potential sites to serve as a flagship for Stargate, weighing their access to water, power and telecom networks. But it’s struggled to forge a consensus with partners, leading to a slower-than-planned rollout, SoftBank Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said during an earnings call Thursday.\n\nIn January, when US President Donald Trump first unveiled Stargate, Son stood beside him and promised to deploy $100 billion “immediately” into data centers, electricity generation and other infrastructure to power AI. But the Stargate rollout stalled after economic risks stemming from US tariffs and the rise of cheaper AI alternatives such as DeepSeek made it harder to create the pricing models to secure project financing, Bloomberg reported in May.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:02:57.316135+00:00"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nChipmakers and industry associations are showing mixed support for President Donald Trump’s proposed 100% tariffs on semiconductor imports.\n\nDuring a press event at the Oval Office with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Trump said Wednesday that “there will be no charge” for companies that are doing business or building capacity in the United States. He also warned companies will be charged if they lie about their plans.\n\n“You have to pay. And that’s a guarantee,” Trump said, adding later, “I think the chip companies are all coming back home.”\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association, a D.C.-based trade and lobbying group, expressed support for the 100% tariff on chip imports, saying it looks forward to learning more about the exemption details.\n\n“Trade is critical to American semiconductor leadership. And so we hope the tariff exemptions and future trade deals are designed to ensure the U.S. semiconductor industry retains its pole position in the race to be the most globally competitive,” SIA President and CEO John Neuffer said in a statement Thursday.\n\n“We are eager to learn more about the President’s plan for semiconductor tariffs, including the scope and structure of exemptions for companies manufacturing in the U.S.,” Neuffer added.\n\nThe effort builds on the president’s America First agenda to grow domestic manufacturing, in part by pressuring companies to reorient their supply chains and operations via increased tariffs. In recent months, Trump has negotiated with a number of world leaders for exemptions to his country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs, which went into effect Aug. 7. In addition to chips, Trump has also threatened 250% tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.\n\nGlobalFoundries, a New York-based chipmaker with manufacturing in Germany and Singapore, is “monitoring the situation closely,” a spokesperson said. However, the company provided no comment as there is no official policy proposal published yet.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, did not respond to a request for comment. The company has been in Trump’s good graces after pledging to invest $100 billion in March to expand its U.S. manufacturing capacity. It completed construction of a second fabrication plant in Phoenix this year, and broke ground on a third fab in April. TSMC produces chips for several U.S. companies, including Apple, AMD and Nvidia, with plans to ramp up additional capacity over the next five years.\n\nNvidia, which contracts out its Blackwell chip designs for production at TSMC’s Phoenix location, declined to comment.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Reuters reported that Dan Lachica, president of the Semiconductor and Electronics Industries in the Philippines, said Trump's plan would be \"devastating\" for his country.\n\nIn Malaysia, a global leader in chip testing and packaging, trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz warned parliament his country “will risk losing a major market in the United States if its products become less competitive as a result of the imposition of these tariffs,” Reuters also reported.\n\nTrump calls for resignation of Intel’s CEO\n\nMeanwhile, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who has been on a cost-cutting spree since taking over in March, recently came under fire from Trump over his qualifications to lead one of the largest U.S. semiconductor companies.\n\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump posted Thursday morning on his social media platform Truth Social. “There is no solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”\n\nUnder the leadership of Tan, a former executive at chip software maker Cadence Design Systems, Intel has stated plans to reduce its global workforce by 25%, exit multiple international construction projects and decelerate its ongoing chip fab project in New Albany, Ohio. The CEO has also recently faced criticism for certain alleged ties to China.\n\nArkansas Sen. Tom Cotton raised national security concerns in a letter dated Aug. 5, saying Tan “controls dozens of Chinese companies” and has stakes in hundreds of China-based advanced manufacturing and chip firms.\n\nHe also said Tan oversaw his former company Cadence during a period of “illegal activity.” Last week, Cadence pleaded guilty to selling its software to a restricted military university in China. It agreed to pay a fine of $140 million.\n\nIn a memo to employees, Tan addressed Trump’s comments and allegations, saying “there has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles.” Despite these pressures, Intel is on board with his America First agenda.\n\n“We are engaging with the Administration to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts,” Tan said. “I fully share the President’s commitment to advancing U.S. national and economic security, I appreciate his leadership to advance these priorities, and I’m proud to lead a company that is so central to these goals.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:02:59.562121+00:00"}

Apple recently committed $100 billion in new U.S. investments, bringing its total planned spend to $600 billion over the next four years.

Cook met with Trump a number of times throughout his first term in office and made investment commitments in the US that helped spare Apple from the worst of Trump’s levies.\n\nIn 2017, Apple announced its Advanced Manufacturing Fund aimed at investing $1 billion in US companies, including $200 million for Corning’s Harrodsburg, Ky., plant. That’s the same facility Apple committed $2.5 billion to during its press event Wednesday.\n\nIn January 2018, as Trump threatened a trade war, Apple again came forward with a plan to invest in the US. This time, the company said it would contribute $350 billion to the economy via new investments and spending at domestic suppliers and manufacturers. The move coincided with Apple repatriating some $250 billion under a tax bill at the time.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:03:11.181212+00:00"}

But Trump is essentially extorting certain companies to get things he wants from them. Clever CEOs are playing along, whether shareholders like it or not.\n\nExhibit A consists of Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which are basically buying export licenses from the Trump administration so they can sell semiconductors in China. Both companies have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from chip sales in China in exchange for the right to sell there.\n\n“My political head is spinning again with this new pay-to-play plan with Nvidia and AMD,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in an Aug. 11 analysis. “I pray for the sake of American free market capitalism that it stops here.\"\n\nThe Nvidia and AMD deals immediately bring to mind competitor Intel (INTC), which hasn’t yet agreed to cough up an export toll. Here’s a safe guess: It, too, will pay a similar fee for similar privileges.\n\nAt the moment, Intel is doing damage control. On Aug. 7, Trump directly attacked CEO Lip-Bu Tan, saying on social media that he “must resign, immediately.” Trump and some other Republicans seem to be concerned that Tan had improper connections with China’s military at another firm he ran until 2021.\n\nTan, a US citizen, now plans to meet with Trump to demonstrate his commitment to American interests, according to the Wall Street Journal. Fine. But that’s probably not what Trump is looking for. Trump has a feral instinct for detecting vulnerability in adversaries and using that leverage to extract measurable gains. He’ll want something more tangible from Tan and Intel than reassurances. Trump’s favorite currency is money. Intel probably has no choice but to pay.\n\nNvidia’s 15% gratuity to the government for chip sales to China will cost the firm about $3 billion per year. The company’s stock dipped on the news, then drifted up. Investors may have first thought only of the bottom line, then decided the payment would be better than losing chip sales to China completely. The hit to AMD would be smaller because its China sales are lower. AMD stock also dipped then rose following the news. Intel stock rose on news of Tan’s chat with Trump, as buyers hope the company’s damage-control effort pays off.\n\nTrump has engineered this whole scenario. In April, Trump tightened restrictions on US chip sales to China, essentially blocking the sale of certain chips. Nvidia said that move would cost the company $5.5 billion in lost revenue. Then, in July, Trump reversed himself and decided to allow such chip sales to China.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:01:03.795940+00:00"}

Or has he, or has been handled by the president, I guess you could say, um with his various meetings in Washington and sort of trying to finesse things in NVIDIA's direction.\n\n00:35 Bill\n\nWell, he's been very astute at working with President Trump. He's made these concessions. Uh he very very much wants to do more business in China. Intel in the past has done exactly the same thing. Uh I think if they're not giving their latest and greatest technology to the Chinese, it may be okay. I'm very wary about giving American technology to China where we're in a big race, particularly AI technology. But uh I think it's, we'll see. My big concern is this is going to spread not just to semiconductor, it's going to spread to other industries. Will we see in pharma where there's a a pay to play so to speak that the US administration will be taking a share of that because the technology research was done in the US. And I I would be very very concerned about that. We seem to be developing much more of a mercantilist approach to our companies and and walking right up if not crossing over the line to separation between government and free enterprise. That's my biggest concern, Julie.\n\n02:43 Speaker A\n\nAnd Bill, you know, even if Terry is right that this this particular type of structure of deal is a one-off, to your point, we have seen a whole host of different flavors of that mercantilist approach that you're talking about. What in your view are the risks of that approach?\n\n03:22 Bill\n\nWell, that we don't have a line between government and capitalism, as you see in many other countries. And I think that's a big concern. How far do you go? The president just advocated not directed the firing of Intel CEO with no evidence that he uh, yes, he has connections in China. So does Tim Cook, so does Elon Musk. But that should not be a prima fascia evidence for firing him. So I see the the CEO of Intel is hustling into the White House today to try to make peace with the president. But how far will this go? That's my concern and how much direction will there be to private industry about how to run this company? We have the golden share of Nippon Steel. And so the president's clearly taking an investment if you will, on behalf of the government in in a lot of industries. And I'm concerned, you know, we're just at the start of this administration. How far is that going to go? And we'll see. And also, the commitments being made, huge. I mean, like Apple, $100 billion on top of $500 billion. Uh enormous in four years. A lot of that won't play out till the end of the administration, but I think these tariffs, no, I think is going to take effect much sooner.\n\n05:28 Speaker A\n\nAnd and Terry, you know, sort of what we hear Bill describing there. What are the implications for investors, both in the case of AMD and NVIDIA, but also just sort of the the way that companies need to approach this administration in the future? From an investment perspective, what do people need to think about?\n\n06:03 Terry\n\nWell, take this NVIDIA AMD story with the 15%. Put it to, put it to the side for one second. What you've got though, is a situation where there is much more government direction and aspiration to direct the economy than there was before. The administration has been crystal clear about that. And as a matter of, as a matter of United States policy, as a matter of national security policy. One of Belsen's mantras has been for months that US National Security Policy is United States economic policy. Economic policy is national security policy. You have a situation here where they're doing everything they can, including providing huge incentives to the the manufacturing industry to onshore, to put to use tariffs in part to push different industries to onshore critical materials and and goods and the like. They've done everything short of invoking the Defense Production Act, which would essentially harness industry to government aims. Why are they doing that? Because they're, they are urgent about the nature of the Chinese challenge and how relatively speaking, how little time they think they have to write the ship. Uh and frankly, harness industry to to right size the economy to meet the Chinese challenge. That's what they think. They've been very transparent about that. And I would I would imagine that would continue and frankly, accelerate. Markets continue to be surprised every time they see something happen, like the United States taking an investment in rare earths. But you you can expect a lot more of it. It's not going, it's not, should should not be surprising at all.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:01:05.741945+00:00"}

Here's what investors need to know today.\n\n1. US Stock Futures Little Changed as Investors Watch for Inflation Data\n\nU.S. stock futures are little changed as investors look ahead to today's release of July inflation data. S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq futures all are near flat after the indexes closed lower in the prior session. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) price levels are down to around $118,000 after approaching all-time highs yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is little changed. Gold and oil futures are pointing slightly lower.\n\n2. CPI Expected to Show Inflation Increased in July\n\nInflation is expected to have moved higher in July when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. The CPI report is expected to show prices rose by 2.8% year-over-year last month, up from June's 2.7% reading, according to economic consensus compiled by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires. The closely watched \"core\" CPI reading is expected to have increased to 3.1% from 2.9%.

U.S. Extends Tariffs Truce With China by 90 Days\n\nThe White House on Monday extended its trade truce with China by 90 days, hours before it was set to raise tariffs on Chinese-made goods to an extreme level. Had President Trump not extended the pause, tariffs on most products from China would have risen to 145% starting Tuesday. The two sides have scaled back their mutual tariffs )though still set at elevated levels), and lifted restrictions on materials such as rare earth minerals from China and U.S.-made computer chips.\n\n4.

Musk wrote on his X social media network late Monday that its parent company, xAI, \"will take immediate legal action\" against Apple for an alleged \"antitrust violation.\" Musk, whose xAI developed the Grok AI chatbot, wrote, \"Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either 𝕏 or Grok in your 'Must Have' section when 𝕏 is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?\"\n\n5.

Here are a few stocks you should hold on to indefinitely.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nStock price year range: $169.21 to $260.10\n\nMarket cap: $3.39 trillion\n\nGenerally, Apple is never a bad investment. Though it has a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating from analysts, with some suggesting potential upside based on price targets and positive earnings reports, there are worries about slower iPhone growth and potential tariff risks.\n\nHowever, Apple has proven over and over again to be an extraordinary company that has a massive following and fan base. This, along with its consistent performance and track record, makes it a true profit-generating machine. It also pays dividends that allow you to reinvest and buy more shares, which only strengthens your position and boosts your wealth.\n\nFor example, and for the sake of easy math, if you had invested $100,000 in Apple 10 years ago, you would be sitting on a good chunk of change now. At the end of that year (2015), the stock closed around $23.78 a share, which would have given you just over 4,205 shares.\n\nAs of Aug. 11, 2025, the stock price is $228.55, which means if you just held on to the stock, you’d have about $961,053. This example doesn’t factor in reinvested dividends or splits, but still shows you how you could have nearly become a millionaire with just one big upfront investment that you didn’t sell.\n\nUp Next: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 6 Steps I Took To Become Rich on an Average Salary\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nStock price year range: $194.68 to $488.54\n\nMarket cap: $1.08 trillion\n\nOne of the most important lessons you can learn about making money in the market is to invest in what you know and love — i.e. companies that are aligned with your vision of the future.

But what MP actually mines—so-called rare earth elements that are central to many of the world’s most important technologies—appears to be even more precious than gold to investors.\n\nMP is the nation’s only rare earths miner, at a time when the U.S. aspires to compete against China’s supply chain dominance in that field. Its share price has spiked an astonishing 365% year to date, including a 150% surge in just over a month.\n\nMP’s market cap has risen from just over $2 billion to $13 billion, entering large-cap territory—not bad for a company that brought in just $204 million in revenue last year. It’s a rise comparable to that of Silicon Valley defense firm Palantir—but with all due respect to that AI-fueled company, Palantir’s stock has risen by only 140% year to date.\n\n“I give MP credit for having the foresight and for being in the right place at the right time,” Ben Kallo, Baird senior research analyst, told Fortune. “I think it’s surprising because I didn’t believe the government would react in such a quick and forceful way.\n\n“I think the fire is in the belly of supply chain managers to move away from China right now.”\n\nMP also is the nation’s only vertically integrated miner and specialty magnets producer, having just opened a metals and neodymium magnets plant in Fort Worth.

General Motors was MP’s first flagship customer for magnets.\n\nFrom a military standpoint, the magnets are just as crucial: They’re used in drones, fighter jets, missile systems, and nuclear submarines. More than 80% of the world’s neodymium magnet supply is manufactured in China. The U.S. counts a few manufacturers, while China has a few hundred.\n\n“Rare earth” materials actually are not rare, but they are expensive to separate and refine. That growth takes financial support.\n\nThe Defense Department bought $400 million worth of MP shares in July to become a 15% shareholder; on Aug. 10, it backed up its initial deal with an additional $150 million loan to MP to help expand its mining operations in Mountain Pass, Calif.\n\n“We are taking decisive action to restore our domestic critical minerals supply chain, revive our industrial base, and rebuild our military to achieve President Trump’s goal of peace through strength,” said Emil Michael, defense undersecretary for research and engineering, in a statement.

After months of worries over ever-costlier tariffs on imported goods -- including its all-important iPhone -- Apple is now (mostly) off the hook. The White House announced on Wednesday that in exchange for an additional $100 billion worth of investment in American manufacturing of the tech used in its devices, Apple would be exempt from the 100% import tariff President Donald Trump has recently threatened for any semiconductors shipped into the United States.\n\nThe specifics of the exemption and Apple's plans still aren't clear, nor is it clear they ever will be. Apple also seemingly made the investment decision independent of President Trump's involvement, yet Apple CEO Tim Cook was still present when the president made the announcement from the White House on Wednesday. The president only explained of the newly proposed chip and semiconductor tariff that \"the good news for companies like Apple is if you're building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge.\"\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that Apple and its shareholders are better off with Tim Cook working with the U.S. president than they are by working around him.\n\nA complicated moving target\n\nIf it seems like President Trump's tariffs are forever changing, you're not imagining things. They are. He's maneuvering in response to companies' efforts to sidestep his previously imposed tariffs. For instance, after February's announcement of an additional 10% import tariff on goods made in China -- where most iPhones are still assembled -- was eventually pumped up to 54%, Apple soon began working to shift more iPhone production to India.\n\nTrump countered in April with an additional 26% tariff on goods exported from India to the United States, and in May specifically threatened a 25% tariff on U.S. iPhones regardless of where they were manufactured. In the meantime, in response to the country's continued purchases of crude oil from Russia, the White House has punitively imposed an additional 25% tariff on all of India's goods imported into the United States.\n\nIt seems Apple, however, will be sidestepping at least a significant chunk of these additional costs. By agreeing to raise its previous investment commitment in American manufacturing of technological components from $500 billion to $600 billion, Trump says Apple isn't subject to the 100% import tariff on semiconductors that other chip companies like Intel could soon be paying. Although the time frame isn't necessarily linked to the exemption, Apple says this investment will be deployed over the course of the coming four years, positively impacting 79 U.S. factories managed by 10 manufacturing partners including Corning, Texas Instruments, and Broadcom, just to name a few.\n\nArguably of most interest to Trump is the fact that Apple's so-called American Manufacturing Program should support as many as 450,000 domestic jobs.\n\nWhat it means for Apple shareholders\n\nThere is no executive order yet declaring Apple or any other outfit exempt from any of Trump's tariffs, for the record -- only the president's spoken statements at Wednesday's press conference, which didn't clarify if the entirety of an imported iPhone is exempt, or only the value of the chips and semiconductors found inside it. There's also no clarity as to how microchips made within the United States that are shipped to overseas assemblers that then ship completed products back to the U.S. will be handled. As such, take all of it with a grain of salt.\n\nEven without such details, though, Apple has scored a couple of respectable wins here.\n\nOne of these wins is very specific: a reduction in the amount of tariffs it's been paying of late. The company reported $800 million in tariff costs for the quarter ending in June in the shadow of recent tariff hikes, and predicted $1.1 billion worth of tariff expenses for the three-month stretch set to end in September. For perspective, Apple turned $94 billion worth of revenue into net income of $23.4 billion in what was a relatively typical June quarter, and is expected to report a top line of $101.5 billon for the quarter currently underway. Although not all of this total import cost is going away, presumably a sizable chunk of it will be. Apple should be at least slightly more profitable thanks to this recent development, although not by leaps and bounds.\n\nThe bigger win here is a purely subjective but incredibly important one. By giving the president a highly visible win of his own as well as a key talking point he can now leverage, Apple and its CEO Tim Cook are back in Donald Trump's good graces. More to the point, by virtue of being a high-profile American company that Trump now wants -- and even needs -- to thrive, it's likely that the president will largely leave Apple out of the crosshairs of future tariffs and executive orders.\n\nEnough reason to buy?\n\nBut is this reason enough to buy Apple stock?\n\nTruth be told, while all the newly introduced tariffs were highly criticized and created a great deal of investor angst, they were never a reason not to own Apple shares. Oh, they're certainly a cost. There's also no denying Apple was caught in the middle of what was ultimately a complicated geopolitical battle between a handful of industrialized countries' leaders. These tariffs were never an existential threat to the company, however. Last quarter's 13% year-over-year improvement in iPhone revenue against a tariff-laden backdrop says as much.\n\nStill, to the extent tariff worries were holding an otherwise bullish Apple stock back, that ceiling is no longer in place. The bullish argument is even stronger now. That's particularly true given the company's regrouped artificial intelligence efforts. It expects much of this consumer-facing tech to be of true Apple caliber by next year, including an upgraded version of Siri, AI-enabled glasses, and some of the anticipated features of Apple Intelligence that were missing when the platform was first launched in October of last year.\n\nAnd the underlying opportunity is big to be sure. All told, Global Insight Services expects this consumer-facing sliver of the artificial intelligence market to grow at an average annual pace of 22% through 2034. Apple's powerful brand name along with its new and improved AI tech position it to win more than its fair share of this market's growth. The tariff exemption only makes doing so even easier.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:01:35.576935+00:00"}

Twenty years ago, the largest companies in the land hailed from the oil and industrial industries. For example, in 2005, the largest companies in the U.S., measured by market cap, were ExxonMobil and General Electric, worth $392 billion and $375 billion, respectively. Now, two decades later, technology enterprises, particularly those involved in artificial intelligence (AI), are at the top of the charts.\n\nThree of the world's most recognizable companies are at the forefront. AI chipmaker Nvidia leads the field at $4.3 trillion, within striking distance of a new all-time high. Software and cloud purveyor Microsoft also appears poised to climb to new heights, recently climbing to $3.9 trillion. Rounding out this tech trifecta is iPhone maker Apple at $3.1 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of $2.3 trillion, it might seem a bit premature to predict Amazon's (AMZN -0.70%) admission. After all, fair-weather investors have fled, and the stock is flat so far this year, weighed down by tariff-related uncertainty. However, other segments of Amazon's business appear poised to spark a renaissance in the company's growth, securing its membership in the $3 trillion club.\n\nThe tariff conundrum\n\nThe Trump administration's tariff policies remain in flux, and the resulting uncertainty is weighing on Amazon's stock. That's easy to understand, as third-party merchants generate roughly 62% of unit sales, and many of these goods are sourced from China. A recent deal set a minimum levy of 30% on Chinese imports, while some products are saddled with a higher rate. The recent trade agreement notwithstanding, investors are wary of the ongoing impact on Amazon's e-commerce sales.\n\nResults from the second quarter and Amazon's forecast seemed to confirm their worst fears. Overall net sales increased 13% year over year to $167.7 billion, with 61% of its revenue from digital sales or third-party seller services. The company's third-quarter outlook is telling. While Amazon is forecasting revenue growth of 11.5% at the midpoint of its guidance, it expects operating income to be essentially flat, in no small part thanks to tariffs.\n\nPartly cloudy\n\nThe good news is that its cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), won't be directly affected by tariffs. For context, AWS generated 19% of Amazon's revenue and 58% of operating income so far this year, helping insulate the company somewhat from tariffs.\n\nFurthermore, AWS is the worldwide leader in cloud infrastructure services, with a market share of 32% in Q1, according to market analyst Canalys. Furthermore, the segment is growing at a respectable pace, with sales of $31 billion representing a roughly 18% increase.\n\nGrowth has reaccelerated over the past year, driven by rising demand for AI. In June, CEO Andy Jassy pulled back the curtain, revealing that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and apps in development or already built, and the company plans to create many more. \"AI will be a substantial catalyst,\" Jassy said.\n\nAmazon's cloud customers represent a captive audience and target market for its AI products and services, which will be a catalyst for future growth.\n\nA distinct \"ad\"vantage\n\nAnother area fueling Amazon's growth is advertising, which is by far the company's fastest-growing segment. Ad revenue grew 23% year over year to $15.7 billion in Q2, and now accounts for more than 9% of total revenue. Its growth has expanded beyond in-search advertising, driven by Amazon Prime, live sports programming, Fire TV, and Twitch -- the company's live-streaming gaming platform.\n\nAmazon also recently inked deals with Roku and Disney to drive future growth. The company now reaches more than 80% of connected TV (CTV) households in the U.S., significantly expanding the reach of its advertising.\n\nThe path to $3 trillion\n\nAmazon has a market cap of roughly $2.32 trillion as of this writing, so it will only take a stock price increase of about 29% to boost its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $708 billion in 2025, resulting in a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would need revenue of roughly $914 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting Amazon's growth to be roughly 10% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that target, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2028. That might well be conservative, as Amazon has grown its annual revenue by 561% over the past decade, and by 13% in the most recent quarter, fueled by demand for cloud and AI services.\n\nFurthermore, at 33 times earnings, Amazon trades at a slight premium compared with a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500 -- yet has generated stock price gains of 719% over the past 10 years, far exceeding the S&P 500, which rose just 202%. This makes a compelling case that Amazon stock is attractive at this price.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:01:44.269918+00:00"}

This move cemented Nvidia's position as the world's most valuable company, beating out other tech heavyweights, including Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia has become the poster child for the accelerating adoption of AI, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) underpin the technology.\n\nAnother big development helped propel the stock higher. In a blog post published on July 14, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the company would resume sales of H20 chips to customers in China after a three-month moratorium. After the ban was issued in early April, Nvidia had taken a $4.5 billion charge related to these H20 chips. The charge combined with the $4.6 billion in quarterly sales that had already occurred suggested there was more than $9 billion in quarterly revenue at stake.\n\nIn the wake of this announcement, several Wall Street analysts issued bullish takes on the chipmaker, citing the resumption of sales in this important market.\n\nMore to come\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report the results of its fiscal 2026 second quarter after the market close on Aug. 27, and investors are likely in for a pleasant surprise. Management was guiding for revenue of about $45 billion, which would represent growth of 50%, but that was before the company resumed chip sales to China. Nvidia had a limited supply of its H20 chips in stock, so the full impact of the easing of import restrictions likely won't be felt until Q3. Furthermore, Nvidia has a history of issuing conservative guidance, so the results will likely be higher than its forecast.\n\nFinally, Nvidia controls about 90% of the data center GPU market, and spending by big tech on capital expenditure (capex) to support AI continues at a brisk pace. At the same time, Nvidia is selling for just 31 times next year's earnings, an attractive price for a company with so much opportunity.\n\nThat's why Nvidia stock is a buy.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:01:45.711487+00:00"}

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having.

It was 2015, and selfie sticks and hoverboards were all over. Apple debuted its Apple Watch to much fanfare, and...perhaps you invested in shares of Zoetis (ZTS 1.17%) stock? If you did, here's how you would have fared over the past decade.\n\nYou would have done pretty well: Your investment would have grown by a total of 227%, which is an average annual rate of 12.6%. So, $1,000 invested 10 years ago would now be $3,270. That might please you, if you're aware that over many decades, the stock market has averaged annual gains of close to 10%. Unfortunately for Zoetis investors, though, over the past decade, the S&P 500 averaged annual gains of 12.7%, a smidge above Zoetis' returns.\n\nWorse still, if you'd only held Zoetis stock for the past one, or three, or five years, you would have lost money. Zoetis shares sank by an annual average rate of 18.7%, 4.25%, and 0.43%, respectively, over those periods.\n\nDon't despair, though -- because anyone buying or holding onto Zoetis shares right now has plenty to look forward to, as the company has lots of growth potential. Recall that Zoetis used to be the animal health division of Pfizer, specializing in vaccines and diagnostic equipment and the like, and was spun off in 2013. Today it's leading in market share across multiple animal health segments and it has made some strategic acquisitions, as well.\n\nAnother appealing detail is that Zoetis is somewhat recession-proof, because taking care of animals' health is not optional for many people. Livestock need to stay healthy for business purposes and pets are often considered valuable members of families.\n\nFinally, Zoetis is a dividend-paying stock, with a recent dividend yield of 1.3%. That may not seem like much, but the total annual payout, recently $1.93 per share, is up from $1.30 in 2022 and $0.50 in 2018. Shares seem undervalued at recent levels, too, with the recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 is well below the five-year average of 32.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:01:51.593708+00:00"}

It could feature a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a 120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It’s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could also come in new colors: purple and green.\n\nThe Pro’s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest. Conceptual renderings show that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons.\n\nNotably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery — which would be a huge win.\n\nAccording to leaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro model could cost around $1,050. The Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250.\n\niPhone Air\n\nImage Credits:Apple Track\n\nThe most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever, the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus.\n\nThis rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones.

The Cupertino, California-based company is best known for its iPhone smartphone, which dominates the smartphone market, garnering more than a 50% market share in the United States. In addition to the iPhone, Apple is a leader in other hardware products such as its ‘Macbook Pro’ and ‘Macbook Air’ laptops and its wildly popular ‘Airpods’ wireless headphones. Beyond hardware, Apple has diversified its business into other areas such as the Apple Watch, Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and AI.\n\nApple Scores Tariff Exemption\n\nWhen you’re one of America’s largest and most successful companies, you garner access to the White House. AAPL shares cratered more than 20% in the two weeks following US President Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day,’ where the US levied hefty tariffs on Apple’s largest supplier and manufacturer outside the United States. That said, longtime Apple CEO Tim Cook has expertly navigated the situation, striking a deal earlier this month with President Trump to avoid tariffs on key Apple products by pledging $600 billion to domestic investments into manufacturing.\n\nApple Services, New iPhone to Bolster Growth\n\nApple’s Services is a primary growth driver for the company. Over the past decade, the segment has grown more than 400%, and continues to grow at a double-digit clip as areas like Apple Pay continue to be adopted by customers. Apple Pay, in particular, provides an opportunity for much more growth into the future. The contactless payment technology has expanded into several international markets like Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Additionally, Apple iPhone users can add drivers’ licenses and states IDs to their Apple Wallet in several states. Meanwhile, the latest version of Apple’s iPhone is expected to be announced next month and should reignite growth in the company’s biggest revenue driver. Overall, Apple is one of the steadiest, predictable, and consistent earnings growers on Wall Street.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple’s Underrated AI Segment\n\nApple has a poor reputation due to the lack of capabilities observed by many customers of its ‘Siri’ personal assistant. However, behind the scenes, Apple has acquired numerous AI-related start-ups to bolster its offering and plan for the coming AI revolution. Additionally, Apple has inked a strategic partnership with AI leader OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its ecosystem.\n\nApple has a Pristine Balance Sheet and a Massive Cash Hoard\n\nApple’s highly profitable businesses throw off more cash than almost any company on Wall Street. The company is sitting on more than $50 billion in cash. This cash hoard allows the company to buy back shares (making for a more favorable supply/demand balance for the stock) and continue to make strategic AI investments.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:01:56.662259+00:00"}

CEO John Strosahl highlighted that Jamf’s platform approach—delivering security and management in one package—has driven customer adoption, especially among enterprise and education clients. Strosahl cited a major deal with a Middle Eastern airline and expanded deployments in education as evidence of this traction.\n\nLooking forward, Jamf’s updated guidance is underpinned by its strategic reinvestment plan and emphasis on automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and channel partnerships. Management believes the expansion into Android enrollment, increased investment in enterprise sales talent, and continued channel development will sustain growth. CFO David Rudow emphasized the focus on improving operating efficiency and targeting a Rule of 40 run rate by the end of 2026. Strosahl commented, “By accelerating our investments in AI and channel capabilities, we are positioning Jamf to deliver long-term growth and enhanced customer value.”\n\nKey Insights from Management’s Remarks\n\nManagement pointed to platform adoption and security solutions as the primary drivers of Q2 growth, while recent acquisitions and AI initiatives set the stage for future operating leverage.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:01:58.392575+00:00"}

We are watching Apple, AST SpaceMobile, and Celanese. First up, watching Apple as Elon Musk threatens legal action against the company. The Tesla CEO posting on X, accusing the company of antitrust violations, saying Apple makes it impossible for AI companies that aren't OpenAI to make it to the top of the App Store. In his post on X, Musk asked if Apple is quote \"playing politics\" by not highlighting his products. Apple and OpenAI have a partnership around AI built into the latest phones. Uh, Musk also has a long-running feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The Tesla CEO says X AI will take immediate legal action. Next up, AST SpaceMobile rising after the satellite company set out an ambitious plan to launch 45 to 60 satellites through this year into 2026. The company also said it received two additional early-stage contracts from the US government. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald see positive catalysts across liquidity, spectrum, and government opportunities. Scotiabank, though, cautious over the company's monetization model and global spectrum ambitions. And finally, chemical manufacturer Celanese sinking today after providing a disappointing third-quarter profit forecast. Management expects softening demand across most key end markets in the second half of the year. The company sees its price target, uh, UBS is cutting its price target as a result to $49 from $66.

Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. My Spotify playlists are undergoing a British invasion this week. Here’s what I’m listening to: PinkPantheress, Lola Young and Evita in London.\n\nPrivileges with the president\n\nDonald Trump announced this week that two US chipmakers would tithe 15% of their revenue from sales in China to the US government. Paying for the license to sell to Chinese customers represents an unprecedented deal.\n\nMy colleague Helen Davidson reports from Taipei:\n\nThe chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the US government 15% of their revenue from advanced chips sold to China in return for export licences to the key market.\n\nThe arrangement will lead to Nvidia giving 15% of its revenue from Chinese sales of its H20 chips, and AMD giving 15% of revenue from Chinese sales of its MI308 chips, according to reports citing US officials.\n\nThe H20 and MI308 chips were banned from sale to China in April, despite the lower-powered H20 being designed specifically to abide by restrictions introduced by the Biden administration.\n\nNvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, head of the most valuable company in the world at $4.44tn, has been lobbying the White House for months to open up sales in China, where the US still prohibits sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips over national security concerns. In July, Trump relaxed some restrictions imposed by Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nThe deal with Nvidia and AMD seems as much about personally appealing to Trump as it does about generating revenue for the US government. The agreement has all the trappings of Trump entering into business with the chipmakers.\n\nIn a way, it’s a version of a playbook other major tech companies have been trying out as Trump is dramatically changing the international business landscape. Apple announced a $100bn investment commitment in US manufacturing. CEO Tim Cook, who had made the journey to the White House himself, presented Trump with a glass trophy (including 24 karat gold base) designating the president a graduate of the Apple Manufacturing Academy, launched in Michigan the week prior.\n\nDuring his meeting with Cook, Trump said he would levy a 100% tariff on semiconductor chips, which could set both Apple and Nvidia back billions. However, the president said: “If you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.”\n\nBoth Nvidia and Apple are likely to be exempted from the tariffs. Each appears to have paid for the privilege – Apple with its domestic investment, Nvidia with its revenue-sharing agreement.\n\nOpenAI debuts GPT-5\n\nOpenAI launched the new version of the artificial intelligence that underpins ChatGPT last week. There are quite a few aspects of the release to consider to understand it fully – what the company is saying, where the AI race between tech giants stands, the model’s new capabilities and pitfalls, the environmental impact – so I’ve rounded up the Guardian’s coverage of GPT-5 below.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T15:01:12.121686+00:00"}

The Cupertino, California-based company is best known for its iPhone smartphone, which dominates the smartphone market, garnering more than a 50% market share in the United States. In addition to the iPhone, Apple is a leader in other hardware products such as its 'Macbook Pro' and 'Macbook Air' laptops and its wildly popular 'Airpods' wireless headphones. Beyond hardware, Apple has diversified its business into other areas such as the Apple Watch, Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and AI.\n\nApple Scores Tariff Exemption\n\nWhen you're one of America's largest and most successful companies, you garner access to the White House. AAPL shares cratered more than 20% in the two weeks following US President Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day,' where the US levied hefty tariffs on Apple's largest supplier and manufacturer outside the United States. That said, longtime Apple CEO Tim Cook has expertly navigated the situation, striking a deal earlier this month with President Trump to avoid tariffs on key Apple products by pledging $600 billion to domestic investments into manufacturing.\n\nApple Services, New iPhone to Bolster Growth\n\nApple's Services is a primary growth driver for the company. Over the past decade, the segment has grown more than 400%, and continues to grow at a double-digit clip as areas like Apple Pay continue to be adopted by customers. Apple Pay, in particular, provides an opportunity for much more growth into the future. The contactless payment technology has expanded into several international markets like Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Additionally, Apple iPhone users can add drivers' licenses and states IDs to their Apple Wallet in several states. Meanwhile, the latest version of Apple's iPhone is expected to be announced next month and should reignite growth in the company's biggest revenue driver. Overall, Apple is one of the steadiest, predictable, and consistent earnings growers on Wall Street.\n\nApple's Underrated AI Segment\n\nApple has a poor reputation due to the lack of capabilities observed by many customers of its 'Siri' personal assistant. However, behind the scenes, Apple has acquired numerous AI-related start-ups to bolster its offering and plan for the coming AI revolution. Additionally, Apple has inked a strategic partnership with AI leader OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its ecosystem.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T15:01:13.907347+00:00"}

This means the top 20 holdings have helped pull the index higher, while the other 480 stocks have been \"a net drag\" on the index in relative terms.\n\nNearly all of the names in the group that have outperformed the S&P 500 index — which includes Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Meta, Broadcom (AVGO), Tesla (TSLA), JPMorgan (JPM), Netflix (NFLX), Oracle (ORCL), and Palantir — have some sort of AI growth story attached to the stock story.\n\n\"Ultimately, Tech companies that leverage disruptive innovation — such as gen AI — drive US equity returns,\" Rabe wrote.\n\nAnd when looking at the market's rebound on a sector basis, there's an AI tilt.

President Donald Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook last week, with Apple announcing a $600 billion investment in U.S. operations, while Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give 15% of revenue from Chinese goods to the U.S. government in exchange for the ability to sell chips to China.\n\nBut coffee chain Dutch Bros' (BROS 2.00%) stock soared last week on its own news, and after middling performance for most of the year, it's up more than 26%, beating the S&P 500's 9% rise.\n\nHere's why the market is loving Dutch Bros.\n\nBack to the basics\n\nInvestors love to get into a detailed earnings report or 10-K filing to see how a company's finances are doing. But the beginning of any great company is a great product. Dutch Bros sells coffee through its chain of just over 1,000 stores today, but its concept was built on innovative products, and that vibrant approach to coffee still drives the business.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the economics here are excellent, which furthers the investment thesis. But it starts with great coffee that customers love, and the high sales follow.\n\nCEO Christine Barone detailed the company's three-part plan to generate higher transaction growth. It involves menu innovation, paid advertising to enhance brand awareness as it rolls out in new regions, and leaning into the loyalty program.\n\nDutch Bros has always differentiated itself by launching its own branded beverages, and that's one way it stands out. Barone called it a mix of art and science, understanding what's trending in the coffee world and translating it into products that its customers want to drink. Some of the innovation is in the customized beverages, such as protein coffee and flavors like lavender, and some of that is in the menu itself. One of the initiatives it's working on is a pilot of a morning food menu, which is driving higher engagement and sales in the morning coffee run.\n\nPart of the product is the experience, and making its stores a positive experience involves rigorous systems and technology to ensure speed and effective customer service. The company takes things slow in that respect to ensure it has its systems in check before opening new stores or making any changes. Barone said that the food menu will roll out slowly through 2026 even though it's already demonstrating positive metrics, to ensure that stores are ready to handle it.\n\nPhenomenal performance\n\nThis fresh approach is driving incredible growth. Revenue increased 28% year over year in the 2025 second quarter, with a 6.1% increase in same-shop sales and a 3.7% increase in transactions.\n\nCompany-operated shop contribution margin was 31.1%, 0.3 percentage points higher than last year, and net income increased from $22.2 million to $38.4 million. Management raised full-year guidance after the report.\n\nMassive expansion\n\nDutch Bros recently hit the 1,000-store mark, up from less than 500 when it went public in 2021. It's planning to double its store count again, hitting 2,029 stores by 2029.\n\nThe company is deliberate in its store opening strategy, but it's going to need to accelerate to reach that target. It opened 31 stores in the second quarter, and plans for at least 160 this year, which means things are going to speed up in the second half of the year. It's going to need to open even faster over the next four years to hit that target, but as it refines and perfects its strategy, it should be easier.\n\nLonger term, it sees the opportunity for 7,000 stores, or seven times its current store count. It has already raised that from its original target of 4,000 stores, and that ceiling could be raised again as it builds its brand and generates consumer loyalty.\n\nDutch Bros is brimming with opportunity, and it's not surprising that investors are scooping it up.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:38:02.256025+00:00"}

Discover SCENE\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk has escalated his dispute with Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of skewing its App Store to favor OpenAI’s ChatGPT over rival AI services, including his chatbot Grok and the X app.\n\n“Why do you refuse to put either 𝕏 or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when 𝕏 is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?” Musk tweeted Monday on his social media platform.\n\nHe followed with a sharper jab: “Are you playing politics?

If App Store curation is influenced by favoritism, it can distort competition in the AI sector by limiting visibility for potentially superior products,” Himanshu Tyagi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science and co-founder of AI firm Sentient, told Decrypt.\n\nStill, some warn that platform favoritism can steer traffic and give companies data advantages, shaping who succeeds in the AI sector.\n\n“The plateau in large language model capabilities makes a moat much harder to build,” Jesse Glass, lead AI researcher at DecideAI, told Decrypt. “Decisions like this one from Apple will play an increasingly large role.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:38:22.799278+00:00"}

At the end of 2025, Apple Intelligence will be available in eight more languages: Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (traditional) and Vietnamese. At this year’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced new Apple Intelligence features like Live Translation, updates to visual intelligence, as well as enhancements to Image Playground and Genmoji. Shortcuts can access Apple Intelligence directly. Developers also get access to the on-device large language model, which is at the core of Apple Intelligence. The latest features are now available for testing and are expected to be generally available this fall with supported devices.

Meanwhile, Apple Pay expands the ability to pay with rewards and installments to in-store purchases for added flexibility and choice.\n\nApple AAPL shares have risen 8.9% in the past month, driven by strong third-quarter fiscal 2025 results and a steady outlook despite tariff-related headwinds. Since the results announced on July 31, AAPL shares have appreciated 9.4%. Since Aug. 6’s announcement of increasing U.S. investments to $600 billion, Apple shares have climbed 6.5%. Apple is benefiting from the growing adoption of Apple Intelligence that is infused across iPhone, Mac, and iPad. The company reported record June quarter revenues in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the United States, Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. The robust performance was driven by double-digit growth across iPhone (13.5% year over year), Mac (14.8% year over year) and Services (13.3% year over year). For iPhone, Apple saw double-digit growth in emerging markets, including India, the Middle East, South Asia and Brazil. Services grew double-digit in both developed and emerging markets. Apple Intelligence is playing a key role in driving this growth thanks to the addition of more than 20 features that include visual intelligence, cleanup and powerful writing tools. Although Apple continues to play catch-up in the AI domain against Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOGL, the third-quarter 2025 results reflect encouraging progress. Year to date (YTD), Apple shares are down 9.2%, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 13.5% and the trio. YTD, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon shares have appreciated 23.8%, 6.2% and 0.9%, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple’s U.S. Investments to Appease Trump, Escape Tariffs\n\nApple now plans to spend $600 billion across the United States over the next four years. The plan includes the American Manufacturing Program (AMP), which is dedicated to bringing more of Apple’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. AMP partners include Corning, Coherent, GlobalWafers America, Applied Materials, Texas Instruments, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, Amkor and Broadcom.\n\n\n\nApple currently partners with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states in the U.S., supporting more than 450,000 supplier and partner jobs. In the next four years, AAPL plans to directly hire 20,000 people in the U.S. in roles including research and development, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning.\n\n\n\nApple’s accelerating U.S. investments are expected to appease U.S. President Donald Trump, who has criticized the iPhone maker’s strategy of manufacturing iPhones sold in the United States in other countries, including India. The latest announcement is expected to help Apple escape potential tariff threats.\n\n\n\nTariffs are currently expected to have a negative impact of roughly $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Apple expects gross margin between 46% and 47% for the current quarter compared with a gross margin of 46.5% in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nApple’s Q4 Revenues to Grow Amid Tariff Threats\n\nApple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2025) net sales to grow mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. The company expects the Services year-over-year growth rate to be similar to that of the June quarter.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $100.37 billion, indicating 5.73% growth over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for earnings has increased 8.1% to $1.73 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.5% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc.

The company’s investments in expanding its manufacturing footprint in the United States are expected to help lower tariff-related headaches. Investors already holding AAPL shares should continue to do so based on these factors. However, stretched valuation is a concern for prospective investors.\n\n\n\nAAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Having Elon effectively means that you don’t need a media team to gain traction, as his own comments and statements are going to get enough of the media looking your way, though the question then is whether this is good or bad publicity. And whether that actually matters.\n\nThe old adage is that “all publicity is good publicity,” and there is some truth to the fact that even negative coverage, at a certain level, is beneficial for a business. Though Tesla’s reputation has taken a hit in recent years due to Musk’s political leanings, which has impacted both sales and its valuation, while X’s usage has declined since Musk took over at the app.\n\nSo maybe, Elon’s proving that motto to be incorrect, at least in the modern media world. Though we are all well aware of Elon Musk’s businesses, even with only limited paid promotion, and Elon continues to keep his projects in the headlines, giving him the equivalent of billions in media coverage as a result.\n\nI assume that’s Musk’s intention in this case as well. Like, he must know that this is an easily disprovable claim, while he’s also criticized Apple for restricting X in the same way, despite X deliberately manipulating the App Store rankings by classifying itself as a news app (which it’s not).\n\nElon must know that this is not a fight that he can win. But we’re all talking about it, I’m writing about it, and you’re reading this right now, so there is a clear promotional value for Elon in making such claims.\n\nAs such, I suspect that, in a couple of days, Elon will claim that it’s all good, that he’s spoken to Tim Cook, and everything is right in the world again. Which is what he did last time, though Elon does also run the risk of sparking Apple’s ire, and losing out significantly as a result.\n\nFor example, X’s Grok chatbot went offline this week after making claims about genocide in Gaza, the latest controversy surrounding the chatbot, whole xAI’s new AI companions pose a significant exposure risk for youngsters.\n\nGiven the various concerns, Apple could have reason to pull X and xAI from the App Store entirely, which would be a devastating blow for both.\n\nSo Elon is taking a risk in making these claims. But it continues to work for him, so…", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:38:29.910016+00:00"}

Users code an application once and Uno Platform makes it easy to ship other types of applications from the existing codebase.\n\n“If you’re coding something once and it works on five different platforms on desktop, web, and mobile, you’re getting 5x the productivity already,” Uno Platform co-founder and CEO Francois Tanguay told TechCrunch.\n\nUno Platform is not the only app developer tool platform available, but Tanguay thinks it stands out in a market flooded by vibe coding platforms like Lovable and Cursor. For Tanguay, enterprise developers should have access to productivity tools too.\n\n“Everything we are shipping hasn’t been done before and we like we have a clear road map in terms of how we can add those extra capabilities [to] make everybody 10x faster,” Tanguay said. “Nobody’s capturing that market yet in the enterprise space.”\n\nThe 2-year-old startup’s enterprise focus has attracted customers and investors. Uno Platform just raised a C$3.5 million ($2.54 million) seed funding round co-led by AQC Capital and Desjardins Capital, with participation from Scott Hanselman, the vice president of Microsoft’s developer community, in addition to other angel investors.\n\nThe capital will help Uno roll out its premium tooling tier, Uno Platform Studio, and new feature, “Hot Design” which allows developers to pause a running application and change its user interface in real time.\n\nFrom in-house tools to spinout\n\nTanguay said they wanted to build Uno Platform to be as seamless to use and helpful as working with a consulting agency, which is exactly how the company got started in the first place.\n\nTanguay founded Nventive in 2008 as a consulting agency to build apps for companies right as apps were becoming the next hot technology. After a few years, Nventive started developing the suite of tools that eventually became Uno Platform because the agency was looking for ways to make itself more efficient, Tanguay said.\n\nNventive launched Uno Platform as an open source toolbox in 2018. The open source community could help the agency keep up with frequently changing operating systems that were constantly releasing new versions that required Uno Platform to tweak its offerings.\n\n“We have over a hundred million downloads of the platform, something we wouldn’t have been able to do just by ourselves,” Tanguay said. “It was really betting on the open source, as a community, to help grow that initiative and bet that others would see the same value in having access to a toolbox like this.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:38:31.824798+00:00"}

SPOT shares have surged 105.9% in a year, surpassing the 44.9% rally of its industry and the 18.3% rise in the Zacks S&P 500 Composite.\n\nThe SPOT stock has outperformed its competitors, Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN. Apple and Amazon have gained 2.6% and 30%, respectively.\n\n1-Year Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify’s growth over the past year is appealing to investors. However, the question is whether investors should ride the tide or stay away from it. Let us delve deeper and find out.\n\nSPOT’s Robust User Engagement\n\nSpotify’s monthly active users (MAUs) in the second quarter of 2025 increased 11% year over year to 696 million. Premium subscribers registered 12% year-over-year growth in the said quarter. Successful marketing campaigns in developing markets, a favorable shift in competitor dynamics, and robust global promotional campaign intake drove this user growth.\n\nManagement is optimistic about user growth and anticipates the total MAUs to increase by 14 million in the third quarter of 2025. It expects to add 5 million users as premium subscribers in the same quarter. This optimistic outlook translates into strong user appeal and retention in the long run, an important trait required to tackle major industry players.\n\nSpotify Struggling Over Ad-Monetization\n\nSPOT’s ability to enhance ad monetization weighs on its performance. CEO Daniel Ek stated that this is not a strategic problem, but an execution one. Spotify’s decision to wash off exclusivity from certain podcasts and change its Partner Program model lowered available ad inventory. These changes had short-term negative impacts on ad revenues, which are acknowledged by the company’s chief business officer, Alex Norström.\n\nLee Brown, the global head of advertising sales, exited the company recently. Norström stated that the management was dissatisfied with the progress made, and a change in leadership was inevitable. Although the monetization strategy is robust, the company is unable to execute it efficiently, and the recent change in leadership is a direct response to this setback.\n\nSPOT Faces Stiff Competition\n\nDespite Spotify’s shares performing way better than Apple's and Amazon's over the past year, there is no denying the fact that these two giants pose a significant threat to Spotify’s music streaming business.\n\nPer Digital Music News, Spotify leads the market with 36% of paid audience in the United States as of 2024. Apple Music and Amazon Music’s shares account for 30.7% and 23.8%, respectively. This goes to show that Spotify faces significant challenges from tech giants, prompting it to invest to gain an edge, which affects its ability to balance growth and profitability.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:38:36.681592+00:00"}

This week, Apple has a fresh AI-related headache—but this time, it comes courtesy of the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, who’s threatening “immediate legal action” if the tech giant does not remove OpenAI’s ChatGPT from the top of its App Store rankings.\n\nIt all unfolded late Monday, when the billionaire Tesla CEO took to the social network he bought for $44 billion, X, to level pointed accusations at Apple and its App Store practices. Musk alleged that Apple’s ranking system “makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store,” claiming this amounts to a “clear antitrust violation” and vowing that his artificial intelligence startup, xAI, “will take immediate legal action.”\n\nBattle over App Store rankings\n\nAt the heart of Musk’s complaint is Grok, the AI chatbot launched by his xAI startup as a direct competitor to ChatGPT. As of Tuesday morning, ChatGPT holds the coveted top spot among free apps in Apple’s App Store in the United States, while Grok sits at sixth. For context: Google’s Gemini chatbot trails far behind, ranking 57th. Musk alleges improper favoritism, especially given Apple’s high-profile partnership with OpenAI, announced in June 2024, that integrates ChatGPT more deeply with iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\n\n“Apple is acting in a way that hinders any AI firm, other than OpenAI, from achieving the top position in the App Store, which constitutes a clear violation of antitrust laws,” Musk wrote in one post. He further questioned Apple’s editorial decisions: “Why do you decline to include either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ category when X holds the title of the world’s leading news app and Grok ranks fifth among all applications? Are you engaging in political maneuvering?”\n\nApple and OpenAI face growing scrutiny\n\nMusk’s attack on Apple arrives in a climate of mounting regulatory scrutiny. Earlier this year, a U.S. judge found Apple in violation of a court order requiring changes to App Store competition rules, following a lawsuit by video game studio Epic Games. The European Union fined Apple €500 million in April for blocking app developers from steering users to cheaper outside offers, citing anticompetitive behavior.

The health and fitness industry has grown from a niche interest into a powerhouse market, driven by a cultural shift toward healthier living. People are no longer content with occasional workouts; they are actively seeking better nutrition, structured fitness plans, and holistic wellness services. Gyms, supplements, and specialized programs are booming, while technology has made staying on track simpler than ever. Wearables, mobile apps, and online coaching now give users instant insights, personalized plans, and constant motivation. Rising concerns over obesity, chronic disease, and mental health have only intensified this movement toward proactive self-care. Major tech players are also fueling the surge. Apple AAPL, through its Apple Watch and Fitness+ platform, integrates real-time health tracking with guided workout experiences. Amazon AMZN is expanding in healthcare with acquisitions like One Medical, pairing artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools with virtual care to make health management more accessible. These innovations are reshaping how consumers engage with wellness, blurring the lines between fitness, healthcare, and everyday life — and pushing the industry’s growth into overdrive. The numbers tell a compelling story. The global health and wellness market is projected to hit $11 trillion by 2034, at a steady 5.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2025. Preventive care, corporate wellness programs, and supportive government policies are reinforcing this trajectory. Meanwhile, specialized offerings — from boutique fitness studios to premium wellness clubs — are thriving, reflecting a more holistic approach where physical health, nutrition, and mental well-being are deeply connected. This shift is creating fresh revenue streams for forward-thinking brands, with names like Peloton Interactive PTON, Sprouts Farmers Market SFM, SunOpta STKL, and The Beachbody Company BODI emerging as key players. For investors, the takeaway is clear: wellness is no passing trend. As consumers continue to prioritize their health, demand for fitness, nutrition, and digital health solutions should remain robust.

Its core offerings include the Peloton Bike, Bike+, Tread, and Row, complemented by the Peloton App, which delivers live and on-demand classes across cycling, running, strength training, yoga, and more. The platform integrates performance tracking, instructor-led motivation, and social engagement features, creating an interactive fitness experience that extends beyond the physical hardware. This approach positions Peloton squarely within the health and fitness theme, aiming to make high-quality, engaging workouts accessible at home and on the go.\n\n\n\nOver time, Peloton’s business model has evolved from primarily selling connected fitness hardware to a more balanced mix of product and subscription revenues. The subscription segment, comprising All-Access Memberships for hardware owners and App Memberships for digital-only users, has become a key driver of recurring income and user engagement. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has expanded its content library, introduced new class formats, and enhanced personalization to retain members. Strategic initiatives have included lowering entry-level hardware pricing, offering rental programs, and expanding its digital subscription tiers to reach broader demographics.\n\n\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n\n\nPeloton continues to innovate to adapt to a shifting fitness landscape. Partnerships with third-party platforms and retail outlets have extended its market reach, while international expansion has brought its services to new audiences. The company has also diversified into strength-focused hardware and broadened wellness offerings beyond traditional cardio. Recent efforts to streamline operations and improve supply-chain efficiency aim to strengthen profitability. By combining premium equipment, diverse content, flexible subscription options, and a loyal member base, Peloton has steadily evolved from a niche connected-bike company into a multi-faceted fitness and wellness brand positioned for long-term participation in the growing at-home and hybrid fitness markets.\n\n\n\nSprouts Farmers Market has positioned itself as a health-focused grocery retailer with a wide selection of fresh, natural, and organic products. Its open-market-style stores feature abundant produce, grass-fed meats, dairy alternatives, vitamins, and supplements, catering to shoppers with diverse dietary needs. The #2 Ranked company offeAMZNrs gluten-free, vegan, organic, and plant-based options, reinforcing its alignment with health and fitness trends. Its private-label Sprouts Brand, known for clean ingredients and high quality, has grown to represent about 24% of total sales, appealing to wellness-driven customers seeking trustworthy, better-for-you products.\n\n\n\nOver the years, Sprouts has expanded beyond its original store model, now operating over 440 locations in 24 states, with plans to enter new Midwest and Northeast markets. A notable operational enhancement has been the creation of a proprietary distribution network for fresh produce, meat, and seafood, improving both product freshness and supply chain efficiency. These efforts strengthen its competitive edge in delivering health-oriented perishable goods at consistent quality levels, a critical factor in customer retention and brand trust.\n\n\n\nThe company has also embraced digital transformation to meet evolving consumer preferences. Online sales now account for roughly 15% of total revenues, supported by delivery partnerships with Instacart, DoorDash, and Uber Eats. Sprouts’ loyalty program provides personalized offers to customers engaged in health, nutrition, and sustainability. In 2024, 30% of total sales came from organic products, while plant-based offerings grew 27%. Beyond retail, Sprouts invests in community well-being through its Healthy Communities Foundation, donating over $35 million since 2015. Environmental initiatives such as reducing plastic waste, promoting reusable bags, and supporting local food banks further integrate sustainability into its identity. This combination of product innovation, operational improvement, and community engagement has helped solidify Sprouts’ position in the growing health and wellness retail sector.\n\n\n\nSunOpta operates as a food and beverage company focused on products that align closely with health, wellness, and sustainability trends. Its portfolio centers on plant-based and fruit-based offerings, with leading categories including oat, almond, soy, and coconut-based beverages, as well as frozen and shelf-stable fruit products. The company also develops innovative healthy snacks, catering to consumer demand for nutrient-rich, minimally processed foods. SunOpta’s products are designed for both retail and foodservice markets, supplying major brands, private-label programs, and its own proprietary lines. This focus positions the company as a key player in the health and fitness space, providing clean-label and plant-forward options that resonate with today’s wellness-conscious consumers.\n\n\n\nOver the years, SunOpta has evolved from a diversified natural products business into a more streamlined, high-growth platform centered on plant-based and fruit-based foods. Strategic investments have expanded its beverage production capacity, improved manufacturing efficiencies, and supported product innovation. The Zacks Rank #2 company has prioritized expanding its oat-based beverage line, capitalizing on the rapid growth of the dairy alternatives market. In fruit-based foods, it has leveraged long-standing supply relationships and advanced processing capabilities to deliver high-quality products year-round. These steps reflect a shift toward scalable, high-margin categories closely linked to health and nutrition trends.\n\n\n\nSunOpta’s approach integrates sustainability with product development, enhancing its alignment with health and fitness values. The company emphasizes sourcing transparency, waste reduction, and responsible water use, while also introducing new plant-based and organic SKUs to meet evolving dietary preferences. Recent initiatives include expanding co-manufacturing partnerships, launching value-added fruit snacks, and optimizing its innovation pipeline to target emerging wellness niches. By narrowing its focus, upgrading facilities, and leaning into consumer demand for plant-forward nutrition, SunOpta has steadily transformed into a more agile, brand-relevant business positioned for long-term growth in the health and wellness sector.\n\n\n\nThe Beachbody Company has built a comprehensive health and fitness ecosystem that blends digital workouts, nutrition, and mindset coaching. Its flagship platform, BODi, offers around 140 full streaming programs and nearly 10,900 unique videos, including well-known titles like P90X, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, and 80 Day Obsession. Alongside workouts, BODi markets premium nutritional products such as Shakeology, Beachbody Performance supplements, and BEACHBAR, designed to support weight management, digestion, and overall well-being. This integration of fitness, nutrition, and mental wellness under the “Health Esteem” philosophy positions Beachbody as a full lifestyle solution provider.\n\n\n\nOver time, Beachbody has shifted its business model to adapt to changing consumer needs. Historically reliant on a multi-level marketing structure driven by “Partners,” the company undertook a major change in late 2024 — dubbed “The Pivot.” This transition replaced multi-level marketing (MLM) with a streamlined, single-level affiliate model, removing Partner subscription fees and lowering operating expenses. The company, with a Zacks Rank of 2, now focuses on direct-to-consumer sales through its website and retail partnerships. Access to content has also become more flexible through subscription bundles, à la carte offerings, and the Total Solution bundle, which pairs fitness memberships with Shakeology.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Beachbody is expanding into physical retail to broaden its reach. Shakeology products are scheduled to hit store shelves in late 2025, followed by P90X and Insanity-branded nutritional products in 2026, supported by new fitness programs under these brands for cross-promotion. Innovation continues with targeted wellness solutions, such as Belle Vitale for women’s hormone health and offerings for users of GLP-1 weight-loss medications. These moves keep the company aligned with evolving health and wellness trends while creating new growth avenues. By integrating content, product innovation, and channel expansion, Beachbody has steadily evolved its role in the health and fitness market.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

More specifically, POTUS’s call for resignation followed a Fox Business segment on Cotton’s letter to Yeary by mere minutes.\n\nCotton’s letter also pointed out that from 2009 to 2021, Tan served as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which just last week agreed to plead guilty to a conspiracy charge and pay the US government $140 million to settle claims it sold chip design hardware and software to a Chinese military university between 2015 and 2021.\n\nWhile we’d say an out-of-the-blue political firestorm isn’t ideal — after all, it’s not every day that a sitting US president calls for the resignation of a major private corporation — Intel has been an economic piñata for roughly the past decade:\n\nIn fact, earlier this week, Reuters reported that Intel is struggling to perfect its so-called “18A” high-end chip manufacturing process, pitched as a key step to closing the technology gap with industry frontrunner TSMC and a way to score new clients.\n\nThe setback comes just after the company warned in its most recent earnings call in July that it could abandon the advanced chipmaking space altogether if it can’t attract major new customers. Meanwhile, its planned chipmaking plant in Ohio — funded in part by more than $8 billion in federal grants — continues to face delays.\n\nGood POTUS, Bad POTUS: Meena Bose, executive dean for public policy and public service programs at Hofstra University, told The Wall Street Journal that the White House insisting that a CEO resign is “at the very least unusual, if not unprecedented.” (The Obama administration ousted GM’s then-CEO Rick Wagoner during auto industry bailouts in 2009, and the George W. Bush administration forced out then-AIG chief Robert Willumstad during the financial crisis.)

Limited near-shoring efforts by United Microelectronics and ASE leave them vulnerable and at risk of losing market share to US-based rivals GlobalFoundries and Amkor.\n\n— Charles Shum, BI analyst\n\nBeyond its primacy as the top choice for AI silicon, TSMC still has significant business providing semiconductors for smartphones, and that sector is on a gradual recovery this year, Sony Group Corp. said after its earnings on Thursday.\n\nApple Inc. also just reported its fastest quarterly revenue growth in more than three years on solid demand in China and said its sales in the current quarter will grow mid-to-high single digits year-over-year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:39:02.568580+00:00"}

Now, the Japanese company — one of the world’s biggest suppliers of chipmaking tools — is struggling to address the potential fallout with one of its most important customers and with governments in Tokyo and Taipei.\n\nTokyo Electron said that it fired an employee at its Taipei unit in connection with the case and is cooperating with the ongoing investigation.

The Tokyo Electron arrest raises questions about why its employee would be involved in such an endeavor, whether it would have any motivation to steal TSMC trade secrets and whether the case ties into Japan’s own ambitions to build a domestic chip industry.\n\n“The fact that Tokyo Electron has come under the spotlight in this way feels like an unfortunate accident,” said Atsushi Osanai, a professor at Waseda University.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, in team meetings around the organization, Tokyo Electron employees were instructed to refrain from talking about the matter, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named describing private information. Company managers flew to Taiwan to deal with the aftermath, one person said.\n\nSo far, the company has not found evidence that trade secrets were shared with third parties, Tokyo Electron said. It said it was unable to provide further details on a case under judicial review.\n\nTaiwanese prosecutors have not disclosed many details of their investigation and have not identified who they think was behind the six people arrested.\n\nAlongside Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Research Corp., Tokyo Electron plays a low-profile but crucial supporting role to the world’s chipmakers including TSMC, Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp., making machines that coat, etch, process and clean silicon wafers to create semiconductors.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:39:06.408883+00:00"}

For more on the trading day takeaways, let's get over to Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre, who's here with me. Jared, takeaway one, what do we got?\n\n00:15 Jared Blikre\n\nTech records, and let's take a look at that. So we got one from the NASDAQ 100 and the NASDAQ composite. It wasn't a big gain today, 35 basis points or about 1/3 of 1%, but as you can see from this year to date chart, looking good, up 10% off much more off of these lows here. And what was powering it? Guess what? The Mag 7 index itself and uh MAGS that ETF I think it's roundhill, but MAGS that got a record high. And you can thank Nvidia too, up 75 basis points. Nvidia got a nice little carve out at least traders think from the latest round of tariffs, and we can see right there, wasn't an intraday high, I don't think, but we did get that record closing high. So again, gets back to the AI trade. What has been working since October of 2022 is still working now. Not all the Mag 7 because you're going to see some red here. Microsoft took a backseat. Uh Berkshire Hathaway is not Mag 7 and that has just taken a dive since uh Warren Buffett announced his impending retirement. But even Apple here, and we'll get to that in a second. So it's been an impressive day from a limited standpoint.\n\n01:56 Speaker A\n\nApple's been an interesting one, Jared, right? Because of how much it has lagged throughout the year, so to see it start to come back a little bit has sort of stuck out.\n\n02:06 Jared Blikre\n\nYou bet, and guess what, there's a golden breakout here. And so we have uh I'm going to show you the 200 day moving average. That's one of my favorites. I'll move over to this board here, and I'm going to plug in that 200 day. We also have the 50 day, but the 200 day is the interesting one. Let me put um you can see it's just kissing it right here. I'm going to put a line so you can see this better at home. And we are right in the price territory. I'm a big believer in price moment uh price momentum and also price memory, and right here we're seeing price memory. All these people who jumped in over here, guess what? When they when liberation day and that fallout hit, they were left with big losses there. And so when price comes back up to that point, some of those people are going to get out at break even. A lot of people have that mentality. I don't recommend it, but that is nevertheless what happens. So right here against that 200 day moving average and with this price memory, we got a little bit of a pause and it'll be interesting to see if we can climb back into the green for the year, still down 12% there, Josh.\n\n04:05 Speaker A\n\nAll right, Jared, looking for the breakout when it comes to Apple, I like that. Takeaway number three, what do we have?\n\n04:12 Jared Blikre\n\nAll right, we got to talk about crypto in your 401k, and we could add private equity to that too. It looks like President Trump is set to do a signing order that's going to give the ability for 401Ks to admit, not only Bitcoin ETFs because we can only do already do that, but spot Bitcoin, spot crypto, and also private equity, and it looks like it's probably going to take six to 12 months for this to roll out. So it's not going to hit tomorrow, but I did think it was interesting. I had some I have some stocks in here. These are private equity stocks and also some uh crypto tickers. The crypto tickers got a nice little bump up on that. In fact, we saw them up earlier in the day, arguably was it due to this, hard to say, but I think uh you can see that in the Bitcoin price which we're going to talk talk see in a second.\n\n05:24 Speaker A\n\nLet's get into the the the coin part share too because I think that's interesting, right? I know you were you were mentioning, uh sorry, the crypto coins themselves. You had mentioned Ethereum I think earlier, saw a pretty good pop today, right?\n\n05:44 Jared Blikre\n\nYeah, so Bitcoin up 2%, Ethereum up 5%, and we're looking for 4,000. That's a really big level. I'm going to show you a six-year chart here so we can see. All right, it's just breaking out of this multi-year consolidation. That's very important technically. 4,000 probably leads us to 4,500, maybe beyond, but Ethereum we're going to be watching in the near future.\n\n06:17 Speaker A\n\nEthereum breakouts been something here. Appreciate you joining us.\n\n06:20 Jared Blikre\n\nYou bet.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:39:15.258239+00:00"}

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Tan's ties to Chinese companies in a letter to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary. He noted that Tan, the former CEO at Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), had invested in Chinese semiconductor companies and others with connections to the country's military.\n\n\"Intel and Mr. Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the U.S. defense ecosystem,\" the company said in a statement to Bloomberg. Intel said it would address the matters in the letter with the senator. The company appointed Tan as CEO in March.\n\nOn Thursday, Intel stock sank 3.1% to close at 19.77.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Tan's connections to Chinese companies were well known before he took the Intel job.

Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last three years, Jamf grew its sales at a 16.3% compounded annual growth rate.

So fast-growing firms that are not all that close to $1 trillion still manage to populate the list below.\n\nMORE: How to turn $1,000 into $1 million, according to a top wealth advisor\n\nCompany (symbol) Market cap Stock growth (3-year average growth) Time until $1 trillion Walmart (WMT) $817 billion 34 percent 8 months JPMorgan Chase (JPM) $805 billion 36 percent 8 months Oracle (ORCL) $716 billion 49 percent 10 months Visa (V) $650 billion 16 percent 2 years, 11 months Eli Lilly (LLY) $604 billion 28 percent 2 years Mastercard (MA) $514 billion 17 percent 4 years, 4 months Netflix (NFLX) $504 billion 71 percent 1 year, 3 months Costco Wholesale (COST) $433 billion 22 percent 4 years, 4 months GE Aerospace (GE) $287 billion 79 percent 2 years, 2 months Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) $279 billion 20 percent 7 years\n\nFor example, Visa (V) has a market cap of $650 billion and with the stock’s recent growth of 16 percent annually, it would reach $1 trillion in around 2 years and 11 months. In contrast, the smaller but faster-growing Costco (COST) will take more than four years at recent growth rates.\n\nOf course, these calculations make a big assumption, namely that recent growth in the stock price will continue for the foreseeable future and won’t be derailed by a bear market or a recession. Stocks growing at brisk rates — GE Aerospace (GE), for example — probably can’t keep that up for long periods.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:39:35.624338+00:00"}

Is Apple Next?", "summary": "Is Apple Falling behind, or will it come from behind?", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/13/nvidia-and-microsoft-stocks-have-reached-a-4-trill/", "published_at": "2025-08-13T12:30:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Is Apple Falling behind, or will it come from behind?\n\nNvidia (NVDA -0.97%) and Microsoft (MSFT 0.17%) have heralded a new era, creating the $4 trillion stock club. It was only 2023 when Apple (AAPL 1.04%) became the first $3 trillion company, and it was also the first $1 trillion company back in 2018, but it has since fallen behind. As Nvidia heads toward a $5 trillion valuation, Apple remains the third-largest company in the world with $3.4 trillion market cap. Can it catch up?\n\nRiding the AI train\n\nNvidia has had a mind-blowing ascent as the premier designer of the graphics processing units (GPU) that are necessary for generative artificial intelligence (AI). It has evolved from a somewhat obscure chipmaker for the gaming industry into a household name that's associated with the AI revolution.\n\nOf course, it's much more than a name. It's an excellent company, reporting massive growth and a wide operating margin, and it's not surprising that investors are noticing its incredible opportunity. In the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), revenue increased 69% year over year, which is outstanding for a company of its size. At the current price, it trades at a forward, 1-year P/E ratio of 31. It's debatable how expensive that is, but it's not astronomical, giving it even further room to run. It could easily reach a $5 trillion market cap before the year is out.\n\nMicrosoft is a Nvidia client, and it's also a leader in software and increasingly, cloud services. It's also investing in AI throughout its business, especially in creating large language models (LLMs) and offering LLM services to developers and clients in its cloud business. Total revenue increased 18% year over year in the 2025 fiscal fourth quarter (ended June 30), and revenue from its Azure cloud segment was up 34% in the quarter. Microsoft stock trades at a forward, 1-year P/E ratio of 29.\n\nBoth of these stocks are reporting tremendous growth, but more importantly, they have incredible opportunities. According to United Nations Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the AI market is expected to increase from $183 billion in 2023 to $4.8 trillion in 2033, or more than 25-fold over 10 years.\n\nFalling far from the tree\n\nWhere's Apple in all of this? It's still the third-highest-valued company in the world, but it hasn't grown as fast as its large peers recently. In fact, it's the only one of the six largest stocks, with the other three being Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, that's down this year.\n\nThere are a number of factors that are creating pessimism. One is its reliance on iPhones, which account for almost half of total revenue. As technology improves, there are reasons to suspect that users will gravitate toward new kinds of devices. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai caused a commotion when he said, \"I think it'll be an exciting new emerging category, but I still expect phones to be at the center of the experience for the next two to three years, at least,\" on Alphabet's second-quarter conference call.\n\nWhile that implies iPhones will be important for a while, it also implies that they may not be in the coming years. You don't have to look too far back in history to see leading companies that became obsolete when they didn't keep up with changing trends, and that's a worry for the market. And at the current price, it's not cheap at all, trading at 29 times forward, 1-year earnings, just like Microsoft.\n\nOn top of that, investors haven't been impressed with Apple Intelligence. While the other tech giants have been launching exciting and revolutionary AI-based features and tools, Apple's AI hasn't excited users. However, CEO Tim Cook stressed on the third-quarter earnings call two weeks ago that Apple is going to significantly increase its investments in AI.\n\nApple tends to do things differently, and that has brought it great success in the past. Apple stock has tumbled several times in the past as well, and it has always bounced back to new heights, bypassing the has-been lane. It's well-positioned right now to leverage its massive user base with improved technology, and there's a good chance that a rebound is just around the corner. I wouldn't count it out from joining the $4 trillion club soon.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T14:35:59.851211+00:00"}

The ruling on remedies has been a major overhang on Google stock.\n\nJudge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia in a 2024 ruling declared Google (GOOGL) a monopolist in internet search. Mehta ruled that Alphabet illegally maintained a monopoly over online search services and prevented rivals from developing their own products.\n\nMehta earlier this year held hearings over what legal remedies should be taken.\n\nThe Department of Justice has asked Mehta to order Alphabet to sell its Chrome browser. Another proposed remedy is unwinding Google's default search deals, including payments to Apple (AAPL). Alphabet pays Apple over $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on iPhones.\n\nRemedy Options\n\n\"There's a sizable menu of options for him to choose from,\" William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University Law School, told IBD. Kovacic served as Federal Trade Commission chairman in the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\"I suspect that he will be inclined to do more than simply issue an injunction that says Google must discontinue harmful behavior,\" Kovacic added. \"In his original decision Judge Mehta said Google has done some valuable things for the economy and for individual consumers. So I think he's wary of a form of intervention that would disable Google from being an effective competitive force in the future.\"\n\nGoogle is likely to appeal the 2024 ruling as well as whatever Mehta does in terms of legal remedies.\n\n\"I think this case is a strong candidate to make its way to the Supreme Court, which means we may be three years away from a final resolution of the case,\" Kovacic said. \"And my intuition is that any remedy that requires significant changes in the business model and the operation of the firms would also likely be put aside until the appeals are finished.\"\n\nDuring the 2024 trial, search competitors Perplexity and OpenAI talked about how not having their own browser has made it harder to collect as much data as Google.\n\nDatabase Sharing One Possibility\n\n\"I think he is very likely to impose some forced sharing of data that will help competitors catch up in building a viable search competitor to Google,\" said Rebecca Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School. \"He spent a lot of time on these issues in the (remedies) hearing and asked a lot of questions. On the other hand, he did not spend much time on the divestiture remedy and did not ask many questions about that possible remedy. At this point, I think an order requiring divestiture of Chrome would be a surprise indeed. But we also know that Judge Mehta has held his cards close to his vest.\"\n\nKovacic agreed that giving third parties access to Google's database is a possibility. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts also are speculating on Mehta's decision on remedies.\n\n\"We continue to believe that most outcomes, save for a Chrome divestiture, will have a relatively small impact on Google's distribution and use of its products,\" said RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson in a report.\n\nHe added that Google has disclosed that 54% of its search revenue is driven through default placements, such as Apple.\n\nApple Reaction?\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth in a recent report said Apple bears watching.\n\n\"Importantly, the ultimate impact to Google will also depend on how Apple — not technically a party to the suit — proceeds in search on Safari once the Google-DOJ case is resolved,\" Anmuth said.\n\nHe added: \"Of all the (possible) remedies, we'd be most surprised by a Chrome divestiture and restrictions on artificial intelligence.\"\n\nThere's been speculation that Apple could pursue an acquisition of Perplexity to catch up in artificial intelligence-based internet search.\n\nMeanwhile, Perplexity on Aug. 12 made an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid for Google's Chrome browser, according to a report. The company said several investors have agreed to back a deal.\n\nRBC's Erickson said: \"Regarding Chrome, we struggle with how that asset could attract a buyer given it is not a business but rather a product, aside from a strategic buyer like OpenAI. With that said, the downside scenario in a forced Chrome divestiture would be significantly worse, while also highly dependent on the buyer where any AI provider would likely preference its products over Google's.\"\n\nAdvertising Antitrust Case Could Impact Google Stock\n\nGoogle also faces another antitrust case. In April, Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that Google has used classic monopoly-building tactics to dominate online advertising. The DOJ had claimed Google's dominance of the digital ad market has damaged advertisers and content creators.\n\nSome analysts have called it the \"DoubleClick trial.\" In 2008, Google acquired leading digital advertising firm DoubleClick for $3.1 billion.\n\nIn September, Brinkema has slated hearings to discuss possible remedies.\n\nThe government has stated that Google should sell off its Google Ad Manager, which includes the company's publisher ad server and its ad exchange. The ad servers and the market for ad exchanges sit between buyers and sellers.\n\nGoogle stock has gained nearly 7% in 2025, rebounding from a lackluster first half of the year.\n\nThe antitrust case has loomed over Google stock. The impact of generative artificial intelligence on the internet search advertising business of Google remains another key issue for investors.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nLearn The Best Trading Stock Rules From IBD's Investor's Corner\n\nWant To Trade Options?

It’s just that Spotify and I have grown up, but we haven’t grown together.\n\nOver the years, I’ve been tempted to leave Spotify many times. I know that the company faces accusations of poor streaming payouts for artists, compared to its competitors, and I haven’t forgotten that it was Spotify that platformed Joe Rogan’s podcast, then exclusive to the platform, to spread misinformation about COVID-19 and other viruses.\n\nI know that Spotify is trying to kill the RSS feed, a move that siphons independence from podcasters. And yet, I’m embarrassed to say that until recently, these issues didn’t move me enough to take the time and energy to investigate alternatives to Spotify, a platform that I’ve been using daily since high school.\n\nIt’s unfortunately easy for us to bury our heads in the sand when the tech companies we pay monthly do things that disappoint us. (Yes, I still remember when Netflix laid off my industry colleagues, but I also know I’ll end up watching the new season of “Love is Blind”).\n\nWe don’t feel like our one subscription makes a difference — after all, Duolingo still beat revenue estimates after sparking backlash when it said it would replace contractors with AI.\n\nBut Spotify finally got to me in a way that’s unavoidable: when I open the app, I cannot bear its all-encompassing, suffocating reliance on algorithmic recommendations.\n\nThere’s an overwhelming display of visual clutter from the time it takes to navigate from Spotify’s home page to the music you’re looking for. These suggestions are front-and-center when you open the app.\n\nFirst, I may see an unsolicited, full-screen pop-up promoting a new podcast. Then, I’m greeted with a 2-by-4 grid of music and podcast suggestions, including new episodes of shows I listened to once because they had a guest I liked, plus some other albums that I’ve dabbled in briefly over the last month or so. Below that, there’s a sponsored recommendation for a song I might like by an artist that I have never heard of. When I navigate to the search tab, I’m prompted with an audiobook recommendation, and if I scroll a little bit, I see vertical video clips that look like they belong on TikTok.\n\nIt’s easy to fall into Spotify’s recommendations, as the app constantly pelts you with customized playlists that its AI has curated specifically for you. On Spotify, you never have to make any decisions — and for some listeners, maybe that’s the point. But I noticed that I stopped listening to the music I actually wanted to listen to, and instead, I embraced the music that Spotify told me I wanted to listen to.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T14:36:04.510803+00:00"}
