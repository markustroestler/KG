The GPU maker's market cap already tops $4.4 trillion. I suspect that Nvidia will indeed be worth at least $5 trillion in the not-too-distant future.\n\nHowever, other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are more of a stretch. Still, I believe that some will join Nvidia in the $5 trillion club. In particular, I predict that Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) could hit a $5 trillion valuation by 2030. Here's how.\n\nLooking at Amazon's core businesses\n\nAmazon's market cap currently hovers around $2.36 trillion. It would have to more than double over the next five years for my prediction to be fulfilled. This almost certainly means that the company will need exceptional growth from its core businesses of e-commerce and cloud services. The good news is that both are already growing by double-digit percentages.\n\nTechnically, Amazon's North America segment includes businesses outside of e-commerce (notably, Whole Foods). However, most of the segment's revenue stems from e-commerce and advertising on its e-commerce platforms. In the second quarter of 2025, this revenue increased by 11% year over year. Amazon's international segment also consists primarily of e-commerce operations. This segment's revenue jumped 16% year over year in Q2.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), which claims the leading market share among cloud service providers, is growing even faster. The cloud unit's revenue soared 17.5% year over year in Q2.\n\nThese revenue growth rates should be nearly (but not quite) enough to propel Amazon to a market cap of $5 trillion over the next five years -- if the company's share price moves in tandem with revenue. However, stock prices tend to correlate even more strongly with earnings growth. Amazon's earnings continue to increase faster than its revenue. For example, the company's earnings skyrocketed 34.8% higher year over year in Q2.\n\nIf Amazon continues to deliver anywhere close to this level of earnings growth and its share price rises accordingly, a valuation of $5 trillion by 2030 should be easily attainable. The big question, of course, is whether or not Amazon can keep growing so robustly. I think it can, with AI tailwinds helping boost profits for its e-commerce business and fuel significant growth for AWS.\n\nNewer opportunities\n\nWe can't overlook Amazon's opportunities to grow in new markets, though. One major growth driver that's on the way soon is the Project Kuiper satellite internet service, which is scheduled to be available later this year.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the Q2 earnings call that \"an impressive amount of enterprise and government customers\" have already signed agreements to use Kuiper's service. He believes Kuiper will have performance and pricing competitive advantages over Elon Musk's Starlink. In addition, Jassy thinks that the integration between Project Kuiper and AWS will be attractive to customers.\n\nZoox is another Amazon business to watch. Its all-electric robotaxis are already available in Las Vegas. Zoox plans to expand into San Francisco, Austin, and Miami next. Fortune Business Insights projects the global robotaxi market could reach nearly $119 billion by 2031. Zoox won't have to capture of big chunk of this market to generate meaningful revenue for Amazon.\n\nI'm keeping my eyes on Amazon's quantum computing efforts, too. The company's prototype Ocelot chip can reduce the costs of quantum error correction by up to 90% versus current methods. AWS just might become a major player in the quantum computing market, which could be huge in the not-too-distant future.\n\nAn ambitious but achievable prediction\n\nAm I 100% confident that Amazon will sport a valuation of $5 trillion or more by 2030? No. A global recession could get in the way. Competition in e-commerce and cloud services could intensify. Amazon's forays into new markets could be less successful than hoped.\n\nThe odds are stacked against any stock more than doubling in only five years, especially one with a market cap already topping $2.3 trillion. But while my prediction is ambitious, I think it's achievable. My hunch is that Amazon will be in the $5 trillion club along with Nvidia and perhaps a couple of other companies by the end of this decade.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:52:43.719140+00:00"}

These 3 Semiconductor Stocks Could Be the Biggest Winners (Hint: Not Nvidia)", "summary": "There's still a lot of opportunity left in AI, and these three stocks look underpriced right now.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/13/tech-spend-1-trillion-semiconductor-stock-win/", "published_at": "2025-08-13T08:35:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "There's still a lot of opportunity left in AI, and these three stocks look underpriced right now.\n\nEvery month it seems like one company or another announces it is increasing its budget for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. Last month, Alphabet released plans for $85 billion in capital expenditures (capex) this year, up from its original 2025 outlook of $75 billion. Not to be outdone, Amazon, a week later, said it increased its capex budget to $118 billion, up from $100 billion.\n\nBig tech's spending is only set to climb higher over the next few years. Market researcher Dell'Oro Group forecasts the top 10 big tech companies will spend over $1 trillion on AI infrastructure in 2028. That's up from about $593 billion this year.\n\nNvidia has been one of the biggest winners of these companies' spending spree so far. Its GPUs play a crucial role in AI training and inference servers. Demand for its chips has pushed both its volume and pricing higher, and that's reflected in its incredible revenue and profit growth over the last three years. Roughly two and a half years into the generative AI revolution, the company saw its revenue climb another 69% year over year, with profits climbing 57% on an adjusted basis during its most recent quarter.\n\nBut Nvidia's strong results of the last three years don't necessarily make the stock a shoo-in to be a great investment over the next three years. In fact, the following three semiconductor stocks look like better investments right now to capitalize on the continued increase in AI spending by big tech.\n\n1. Marvell Technology\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL 0.63%) is the chipmaker behind custom AI chip designs from Amazon and Microsoft. Instead of GPUs, these custom chips, called XPUs, are designed to more exact specifications to optimize price performance for large language model training or inference.\n\nThe XPU opportunity is growing quickly, as big tech companies look to use more cost-efficient chips and reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Broadcom, another XPU maker, expects its three custom silicon customers to spend $60 billion to $90 billion on chips by 2027. Marvell sees a $55 billion opportunity for its customers by 2028. To put that in perspective, its revenue over the last four quarters totals $6.5 billion.\n\nAnd Marvell looks poised to capitalize on that opportunity. Microsoft recently upgraded the specifications of its next-generation Maia300 chip, according to a report from Fubon Research. And while that will push out the production timeline until late next year, it also suggests Microsoft will ramp up its production quickly.\n\nFubon expects 300,000 to 400,000 units ordered for the fourth quarter of 2026, with a similar pace of spending throughout 2027. That could mean $10 billion to $12 billion in annual revenue from a single chip design.\n\nMarvell also designs networking chips for getting the most out of GPUs and XPUs. Networking equipment ensures data moves quickly and efficiently from one server to another. That's essential for getting the most out of the processing capabilities of the expensive servers used for training and running AI systems.\n\nAs mentioned, it isn't the only company working with big tech on custom silicon solutions. Broadcom has several high-profile contracts as well, and just as many opportunities to expand its market share as Marvell.\n\nBut Broadcom's stock is far more expensive for new investors at the moment. Marvell trades for 27 times forward earnings estimates compared to a multiple of 45 for Broadcom. That makes Marvell a much better option for investors looking to capitalize on the rise of custom silicon.\n\n2. Micron Technology\n\nMicron Technology (MU 3.26%) is one of a handful of suppliers of memory chips. Perhaps the most important type of memory chip for generative AI is called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM. These chips are attached to GPUs, giving the processors access to data with minimal latency.\n\nMicron was a bit late to develop its HBM chips, but it has quickly caught up to the competition, and it's winning some big contracts. AMD tapped Micron to supply the HBM3E chips in its MI355X GPUs, which have shown promising results. AMD's newest chips could be poised to take share of the GPU market from Nvidia by offering competitive price performance.\n\nMicron plans to start production on its HBM4 chips next year, after delivering samples to potential customers in the first half of this year. Management says the new chips offer a 60% performance improvement over its current generation of chips with a 20% reduction in power consumption.\n\nHBM chips have been the biggest driver of Micron's results recently. Sales of HBM increased 50% sequentially, driving overall revenue up by 15% from its previous quarter and 51% from the previous year.\n\nAnd the continued ramp-up in HBM should drive expanding margins. Management's outlook calls for a 42% gross margin next quarter, up from 39% in its most recent quarter and 28% a year ago.\n\nThe company sees very strong profit growth in the near future as GPU and XPU makers continue to buy up its memory chips, but it faces significant risks. Since Micron manufactures its own chips, it spends heavily on tooling and capacity while demand increases. But if demand falls, it could see a sharp drop in profitability. That's exacerbated by the fact that memory chips aren't well differentiated and a customer could easily switch suppliers.\n\nStill, the stock currently trades for just 14 times earnings estimates. At that price, investors are getting a lot of potential. And if AI spending continues to rise as expected, this earnings cycle could extend well into the future, making the current price for Micron Technology a great opportunity for investors.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), known as TSMC for short, is the largest chip fabricator in the world. If Nvidia, Broadcom, Marvell, or anyone else wants a leading-edge chip design produced, they're probably going to work with TSMC. That's because it has some of the best technology in the world. As a result, roughly two-thirds of all silicon manufacturing spending goes to the Taiwanese company.\n\nTSMC's technology lead is supported by a virtuous cycle. Since the company commands a huge share of all spending, it has more money to reinvest in research and development (R&D) and building extra capacity. With more R&D spending, it's able to develop and perfect the next-generation processes faster, and it has the capacity to meet demand for new chips, bringing in even more revenue.\n\nThe company recently received several pieces of good news, further improving its competitive position in the industry. First, Intel said it wouldn't offer fabrication services for its newest-generation process. And if it didn't get a major customer under contract for its next-generation process, it would stop developing it entirely. That leaves one less competitor for TSMC as it ramps up its next-generation 2nm process.\n\nAnd TSMC received an exemption from the Trump administration's 100% tariff on foreign-sourced semiconductors. That exemption was likely due to huge commitments from the company to build factories in Arizona.\n\nBoth clear the way for TSMC to ramp up production of its 2nm process, which already has customers lined up. The company is reportedly charging a significant premium over the previous generation 3nm chips. Combined with a quick ramp up in production, it should support strong gross margins as it quickly transitions to the next-generation node.\n\nDespite the recent price gains in the stock on the good news, TSMC shares currently trade for less than 25 times forward earnings. Considering management expects average revenue increases of 20% per year between now and 2029 based on strong AI chip growth, that's still a great price to pay for a company with huge competitive advantages.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:52:45.147582+00:00"}

It's not about hype anymore, as AI is starting to reshape the world we live in.\n\nLet's look at three no-brainer AI stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Palantir\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR 2.30%) made its mark in the government sector after 9/11, providing advanced data analytics to agencies that required rapid solutions. That core business remains strong, but the company's biggest opportunity is now in the commercial sector. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) takes data from countless sources, organizes it into an \"ontology,\" and makes it usable for AI models. The result is that its platform can provide actionable insights that can solve real-world problems across industries.\n\nThe company is seeing AIP being adopted in the commercial space at a blistering pace. Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue jumped 93% last quarter, while its remaining deal value more than doubled to $2.79 billion. Its customer count climbed 64% year over year, yet most are still early in their AIP journey. AIP is essentially becoming an operating system for AI, and its breadth of use cases just gives Palantir an enormous runway for growth ahead.\n\nThe company is also firing on all cylinders on the government side as well, as the U.S. government begins to embrace AI. Its U.S. government revenue surged 53% to $426 million in Q2, with the company winning business across civil, intel, and defense contracts. A recent 10-year, $10 billion U.S. Army contract shows how much of a leader Palantir has become in the defense industry.\n\nWhile Palantir's valuation is high, the company's growth only continues to accelerate. As a true leader in AI, it has the opportunity to grow into one of the largest companies in the world.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) is building one of the most powerful AI operations in the world. In logistics, it's using AI to decide where products should be stored, map faster delivery routes, and even guide drivers to hard-to-find drop-off spots in places like large apartment complexes. It also has more than a million AI robots deployed in its warehouses, including advanced models that can detect damaged goods, handle odd-shaped packages, and repair themselves. It's also introduced a new AI model called DeepFleet that coordinates these robots to move products more efficiently through its warehouses.\n\nThis is helping lead to strong operating leverage in its e-commerce business. This was on display in Q2, as its North America operating income surged 47% last quarter on just 11% revenue growth. Its high-margin advertising business is another bright spot, growing 23% year over year. Here, the company is using AI to improve targeting, bidding, and creative ad generation.\n\nIn cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market leader and is becoming a critical AI platform. Bedrock and SageMaker make it easier for customers to build and run AI models on its infrastructure, while its custom-built chips give AWS a cost edge as AI workloads grow. It's also introduced new tools like Strands and AgentCore to help customers safely build and run AI agents. The company is investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet surging demand, a strategy that should drive strong returns for years.\n\nBetween a leaner, more profitable e-commerce business and a market-leading cloud unit, Amazon has two growth engines. The company's willingness to invest heavily for the future remains one of its strongest advantages, and the biggest reason to own the stock for the long haul.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nOne AI stock that often gets overlooked is Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%). The idea that AI would hurt Google Search hasn't panned out. AI Overviews are driving more user engagement, with more than 2 billion people now using them monthly, and search queries are climbing worldwide. Search revenue grew 12% last quarter, an acceleration that shows the strategy is working. Meanwhile, AI Mode and the Gemini app are only just beginning to scale up.\n\nGoogle Cloud is firing on all cylinders as well, with revenue up 32% in Q2 and operating profit more than doubling. AI demand is a big driver, as customers use Google's Vertex platform to build and deploy AI models on its infrastructure. Meanwhile, its custom AI chips, Tensor Processing Units, can help run workloads more efficiently and are seeing increased adoption. Even with Alphabet planning to spend $85 billion in data center-related capital expenditures this year, its cloud computing capacity is expected to stay tight into 2026, a sign that demand remains high.\n\nIn addition, YouTube is holding up nicely, with ad revenue rising 13% and Shorts bringing in new ad opportunities. Waymo, meanwhile, is rolling out into more cities, while the company is also investing in quantum computing.\n\nFor a company growing double-digits across multiple divisions, Alphabet's valuation is surprisingly low. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 20 times 2025 analyst estimates, and a forward price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 0.85. (Stocks with PEG ratios below 1 are usually regarded as undervalued.) It's a stock that offers both growth and value, and it has the greatest potential to be one of the biggest long-term AI winners in the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:52:46.981466+00:00"}

Here's a look:\n\nCliff Asness at AQR Capital Management added 467,005 shares of Roku, increasing his stake sixfold though it remains a small position.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller at Duquesne Family Office bought 493,600 shares of Roku, starting a modest position that ranks among his 30 largest holdings.\n\nChris Rokos at Rokos Capital Management bought 54,690 shares of Roku, starting a new and relatively small position.\n\nSteven Schonfeld at Schonfeld Strategic Advisors bought 68,886 shares of Roku, starting a new and relatively small position.\n\nWall Street analysts generally agree Roku is undervalued. The median target price is $105 per share, which implies 28% upside from its current share price of $82. Here's what investors should know.\n\nRoku is the most popular streaming platform in North America\n\nRoku is the leading streaming platform in North America as measured by hours streamed, and Roku OS is the best-selling TV operating system in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In addition, The Roku Channel is the fifth most popular streaming service in the U.S., behind only Alphabet's YouTube, Netflix, Walt Disney, and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nPut simply, Roku is ideally positioned to benefit as advertisers spend more on connected TV (CTV). Some readers may be surprised to learn traditional TV advertising is still a larger market than CTV advertising, and it's expected to be the larger market until 2028. But CTV ad spending is forecast to grow at 12% annually through 2029, according to eMarketer.\n\nJeremy Deal, portfolio manager at JDP Capital Management, writes, \"The Roku operating system and The Roku Channel are valuable assets that are highly under-monetized today.\" Deal says The Roku Channel alone is probably worth more than the entire company's current market value, implying Roku is materially undervalued today.\n\nRoku's recent partnership with Amazon could be a meaningful growth driver\n\nRoku in June announced an exclusive partnership with Amazon. While Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP) is not the only media buying platform with access to Roku inventory, it is the only one that can use a custom identity solution to recognize logged-in viewers across the Roku platform in the United States.\n\nA press release from Roku explains, \"This exclusive capability enables advertisers to reach the same viewer deterministically across different streaming channels and devices.\" The upshot for investors is brands on Amazon DSP can now target and measure ad campaigns with greater accuracy. In other words, Roku is now a more compelling place for marketers using Amazon DSP to spend their advertising dollars.\n\nRoku highlighted the benefits following an early test of the integration, \"Advertisers using this new solution reached 40% more unique viewers with the same budget and reduced how often the same person saw an ad by nearly 30%, enabling advertisers to benefit from three times more value from their ad spend.\"\n\nRoku stock trades at a reasonable valuation\n\nRoku currently trades at 2.7 times sales, a discount to the two-year average of 2.8 times sales. That valuation looks quite reasonable for a company whose revenue is forecast to increase at 12% annually through 2027, especially when that consensus estimate leaves room for upside.\n\nAs mentioned, CTV ad spending is forecast to grow at 12% annually through 2029, and Roku is well positioned to benefit given its status as the most popular streaming platform in North America. To that end, its revenue could certainly grow faster than 12% annually with help from its Amazon partnership.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) from $230 to $265, maintaining a ‘Buy’ rating. This price revision reflects growing retail revenue and growth stabilization in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nWhile the company’s Q2 revenue and profit beat expectations, the analyst noted investor sentiment was affected by higher Capex guidance for the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) highlighted growing demand for AWS compute capacity, which continues to exceed supply.\n\nOn the same day, Citigroup also reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating on Amazon.com, Inc.

Most of Bezos’ wealth comes from owning approximately 905 million shares in Amazon, the company he founded in 1994, took public in 1997 and helmed until 2021. But what was his Amazon stock origin story when it comes to building his wealth and shaping his fortune?\n\nLearn More: Barbara Corcoran Put $62 Million Into Her ‘Shark Tank’ Investments — How Much Did She Make?\n\nFind Out: How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?\n\nThe way Bezos handled his early stock sales set the path for decades of wealth accumulation that ultimately positioned him as the world’s fourth-wealthiest person. You can use lessons from his early years and more recent business activities to help secure your own financial future.\n\nQuick Take: Amazon Stock’s Current Performance\n\nBezos’ Amazon holdings have fluctuated over the years as he has acquired and sold shares. For example, last November marked the completion of a planned divestment of 25 million shares announced in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last spring. Here are a few takeaways as to how the company’s stock is currently performing:\n\nStock price: $222.69\n\nMarket cap: $2.363 trillion\n\n52-week high: $242.52\n\n52-week low: $161.38\n\nP/E ratio: 33.73\n\nLesson 1: Start Where You Are\n\nBezos presumably used cash from Amazon stock sales to launch Blue Origin in 2000. And in 2017, Bezos said at an event that he sells around $1 billion worth of Amazon stock each year and uses it to fund the space company.\n\nThe company is private, so its financials aren’t available to the public. But even though it’s entirely possible that Bezos won’t live to see people colonize space, Blue Origin seems to at least be holding its own as it develops rockets and engines for commercial and government use. NASA alone has awarded Blue Origin more than half a billion dollars in contracts over the last several years.\n\nRead Next: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\n\nLesson 2: Build Wealth Through Investing, Not Saving\n\nWhen Bezos worked at Amazon, his salary stayed pretty stagnant at less than $82,000. But he’s been selling Amazon shares since shortly after its initial public offering, according to an analysis of Bezos’ stock sales. That means he has relied on money from stock sales to support his lifestyle and other business activities almost since day one, which appears to be working out for him.\n\nMeanwhile, his wealth keeps on growing because it comes mostly from his Amazon holdings. Those holdings have appreciated far more over time than a savings account balance would have, ultimately providing Bezos with more cash than he could ever hope to spend.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:01.198292+00:00"}

At the end of 2025, Apple Intelligence will be available in eight more languages: Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (traditional) and Vietnamese. At this year’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced new Apple Intelligence features like Live Translation, updates to visual intelligence, as well as enhancements to Image Playground and Genmoji. Shortcuts can access Apple Intelligence directly. Developers also get access to the on-device large language model, which is at the core of Apple Intelligence. The latest features are now available for testing and are expected to be generally available this fall with supported devices. Apple is expanding Services with AutoMix and Lyrics Translation features in Apple Music. Sing will allow users to transform their iPhones into a handheld microphone for Apple TV, while preferred routes and visited places in Apple Map make navigation easier for users. Apple Intelligence is now getting added to Apple Wallet, and users can make purchases with Apple Pay. Powered by Apple Intelligence, Apple Wallet can now automatically identify, summarize and display order tracking details from emails sent from merchants or delivery carriers. Meanwhile, Apple Pay expands the ability to pay with rewards and installments to in-store purchases for added flexibility and choice.\n\nApple AAPL shares have risen 8.9% in the past month, driven by strong third-quarter fiscal 2025 results and a steady outlook despite tariff-related headwinds. Since the results announced on July 31, AAPL shares have appreciated 9.4%. Since Aug. 6’s announcement of increasing U.S. investments to $600 billion, Apple shares have climbed 6.5%. Apple is benefiting from the growing adoption of Apple Intelligence that is infused across iPhone, Mac, and iPad. The company reported record June quarter revenues in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the United States, Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. The robust performance was driven by double-digit growth across iPhone (13.5% year over year), Mac (14.8% year over year) and Services (13.3% year over year). For iPhone, Apple saw double-digit growth in emerging markets, including India, the Middle East, South Asia and Brazil. Services grew double-digit in both developed and emerging markets. Apple Intelligence is playing a key role in driving this growth thanks to the addition of more than 20 features that include visual intelligence, cleanup and powerful writing tools. Although Apple continues to play catch-up in the AI domain against Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOGL, the third-quarter 2025 results reflect encouraging progress. Year to date (YTD), Apple shares are down 9.2%, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 13.5% and the trio. YTD, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon shares have appreciated 23.8%, 6.2% and 0.9%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s U.S. Investments to Appease Trump, Escape Tariffs\n\nApple now plans to spend $600 billion across the United States over the next four years. The plan includes the American Manufacturing Program (AMP), which is dedicated to bringing more of Apple’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. AMP partners include Corning, Coherent, GlobalWafers America, Applied Materials, Texas Instruments, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, Amkor and Broadcom.\n\n\n\nApple currently partners with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states in the U.S., supporting more than 450,000 supplier and partner jobs. In the next four years, AAPL plans to directly hire 20,000 people in the U.S. in roles including research and development, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning.\n\n\n\nApple’s accelerating U.S. investments are expected to appease U.S. President Donald Trump, who has criticized the iPhone maker’s strategy of manufacturing iPhones sold in the United States in other countries, including India. The latest announcement is expected to help Apple escape potential tariff threats.\n\n\n\nTariffs are currently expected to have a negative impact of roughly $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Apple expects gross margin between 46% and 47% for the current quarter compared with a gross margin of 46.5% in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nApple’s Q4 Revenues to Grow Amid Tariff Threats\n\nApple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2025) net sales to grow mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. The company expects the Services year-over-year growth rate to be similar to that of the June quarter.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $100.37 billion, indicating 5.73% growth over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for earnings has increased 8.1% to $1.73 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.5% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nApple Shares are Overvalued\n\nAAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\n\n\nApple is trading at a forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S) of 7.93X compared with the sector’s 6.78X, Amazon’s 3.14X and Alphabet’s 6.79X. However, Microsoft’s P/S of 11.91 is higher than Apple.\n\nPrice/Sales (F12M)\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nApple is expected to benefit from growing adoption of Apple Intelligence and expanding features. The company’s investments in expanding its manufacturing footprint in the United States are expected to help lower tariff-related headaches. Investors already holding AAPL shares should continue to do so based on these factors. However, stretched valuation is a concern for prospective investors.\n\n\n\nAAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Apple and Amazon have gained 2.6% and 30%, respectively.\n\n1-Year Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify’s growth over the past year is appealing to investors. However, the question is whether investors should ride the tide or stay away from it. Let us delve deeper and find out.\n\nSPOT’s Robust User Engagement\n\nSpotify’s monthly active users (MAUs) in the second quarter of 2025 increased 11% year over year to 696 million. Premium subscribers registered 12% year-over-year growth in the said quarter. Successful marketing campaigns in developing markets, a favorable shift in competitor dynamics, and robust global promotional campaign intake drove this user growth.\n\nManagement is optimistic about user growth and anticipates the total MAUs to increase by 14 million in the third quarter of 2025. It expects to add 5 million users as premium subscribers in the same quarter. This optimistic outlook translates into strong user appeal and retention in the long run, an important trait required to tackle major industry players.\n\nSpotify Struggling Over Ad-Monetization\n\nSPOT’s ability to enhance ad monetization weighs on its performance. CEO Daniel Ek stated that this is not a strategic problem, but an execution one. Spotify’s decision to wash off exclusivity from certain podcasts and change its Partner Program model lowered available ad inventory. These changes had short-term negative impacts on ad revenues, which are acknowledged by the company’s chief business officer, Alex Norström.\n\nLee Brown, the global head of advertising sales, exited the company recently. Norström stated that the management was dissatisfied with the progress made, and a change in leadership was inevitable. Although the monetization strategy is robust, the company is unable to execute it efficiently, and the recent change in leadership is a direct response to this setback.\n\nSPOT Faces Stiff Competition\n\nDespite Spotify’s shares performing way better than Apple's and Amazon's over the past year, there is no denying the fact that these two giants pose a significant threat to Spotify’s music streaming business.\n\nPer Digital Music News, Spotify leads the market with 36% of paid audience in the United States as of 2024.

They are also powerful tools that, when used wisely, can help you save money, manage debt and even earn rewards. Whether you're looking to cut down on interest payments, earn cashback on everyday purchases, rack up air miles for your next holiday, or avoid fees while traveling abroad, there's a credit card tailored to your needs.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll break down the best options on the market for balance transfers, purchases, cashback, air miles and travel spending. We'll show you how to use these cards to your advantage, ensuring you get the most value while avoiding common mistakes.\n\nBest 0% purchase credit cards\n\nA 0% purchase card allows you to make new purchases without paying interest for a set number of months. This can save you thousands compared with using a standard credit card, assuming you pay off the balance during the interest-free period.\n\nRead more: How to build passive income\n\nThese cards are perfect for planned, necessary purchases. Think of them as a tool for managing big buys such as a new TV or essential home improvements.\n\nLet’s say you take out a 0% purchase card with a 10-month interest-free period and spend £2,000 on new appliances. If you repay £200 each month, you’ll clear the debt before the interest kicks in. However, if you still have a balance after the 10-month period, you’ll start accruing interest at the standard rate, which can be as high as 27% annually.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. Make sure to pay at least the minimum each month to keep the 0% deal.\n\n2. Borrow only what you can comfortably repay within the 0% period.\n\nKate Steere, a credit card expert at personal finance comparison site finder.com, said: “TSB currently has the longest 0% purchase deal on the market at 25 months, narrowly ahead of M&S (MKS.L) and Barclaycard at 0% for 24 months.\n\n“If you’re planning a large expenditure, like a summer holiday or some new garden furniture, the current range of 0% purchase cards could offer a handy way to spread the cost. None of these cards come with annual fees, but all of them revert to very standard (read 'punishing') rates after the 0% periods end. If you haven't cleared your balance at that point, look at a balance transfer deal.”\n\nBest credit cards for holidays and travelling\n\nPlanning a trip abroad? A specialist travel credit card can save you a bundle by offering near-perfect exchange rates without the usual foreign transaction fees.\n\nMost credit and debit cards charge around 3% on foreign transactions, meaning a £100 purchase abroad could cost you £103. On top of that, some cards add a flat fee for every overseas transaction.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:09.618041+00:00"}

The health and fitness industry has grown from a niche interest into a powerhouse market, driven by a cultural shift toward healthier living. People are no longer content with occasional workouts; they are actively seeking better nutrition, structured fitness plans, and holistic wellness services. Gyms, supplements, and specialized programs are booming, while technology has made staying on track simpler than ever. Wearables, mobile apps, and online coaching now give users instant insights, personalized plans, and constant motivation. Rising concerns over obesity, chronic disease, and mental health have only intensified this movement toward proactive self-care. Major tech players are also fueling the surge. Apple AAPL, through its Apple Watch and Fitness+ platform, integrates real-time health tracking with guided workout experiences. Amazon AMZN is expanding in healthcare with acquisitions like One Medical, pairing artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools with virtual care to make health management more accessible. These innovations are reshaping how consumers engage with wellness, blurring the lines between fitness, healthcare, and everyday life — and pushing the industry’s growth into overdrive. The numbers tell a compelling story. The global health and wellness market is projected to hit $11 trillion by 2034, at a steady 5.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2025. Preventive care, corporate wellness programs, and supportive government policies are reinforcing this trajectory. Meanwhile, specialized offerings — from boutique fitness studios to premium wellness clubs — are thriving, reflecting a more holistic approach where physical health, nutrition, and mental well-being are deeply connected. This shift is creating fresh revenue streams for forward-thinking brands, with names like Peloton Interactive PTON, Sprouts Farmers Market SFM, SunOpta STKL, and The Beachbody Company BODI emerging as key players. For investors, the takeaway is clear: wellness is no passing trend. As consumers continue to prioritize their health, demand for fitness, nutrition, and digital health solutions should remain robust. Our Health & Fitness Screen is designed to spotlight high-potential stocks — including the three above — helping uncover standout opportunities in a market that’s set to keep climbing.

Its core offerings include the Peloton Bike, Bike+, Tread, and Row, complemented by the Peloton App, which delivers live and on-demand classes across cycling, running, strength training, yoga, and more. The platform integrates performance tracking, instructor-led motivation, and social engagement features, creating an interactive fitness experience that extends beyond the physical hardware. This approach positions Peloton squarely within the health and fitness theme, aiming to make high-quality, engaging workouts accessible at home and on the go.\n\n\n\nOver time, Peloton’s business model has evolved from primarily selling connected fitness hardware to a more balanced mix of product and subscription revenues. The subscription segment, comprising All-Access Memberships for hardware owners and App Memberships for digital-only users, has become a key driver of recurring income and user engagement. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has expanded its content library, introduced new class formats, and enhanced personalization to retain members. Strategic initiatives have included lowering entry-level hardware pricing, offering rental programs, and expanding its digital subscription tiers to reach broader demographics.\n\n\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n\n\nPeloton continues to innovate to adapt to a shifting fitness landscape. Partnerships with third-party platforms and retail outlets have extended its market reach, while international expansion has brought its services to new audiences. The company has also diversified into strength-focused hardware and broadened wellness offerings beyond traditional cardio. Recent efforts to streamline operations and improve supply-chain efficiency aim to strengthen profitability. By combining premium equipment, diverse content, flexible subscription options, and a loyal member base, Peloton has steadily evolved from a niche connected-bike company into a multi-faceted fitness and wellness brand positioned for long-term participation in the growing at-home and hybrid fitness markets.\n\n\n\nSprouts Farmers Market has positioned itself as a health-focused grocery retailer with a wide selection of fresh, natural, and organic products. Its open-market-style stores feature abundant produce, grass-fed meats, dairy alternatives, vitamins, and supplements, catering to shoppers with diverse dietary needs. The #2 Ranked company offeAMZNrs gluten-free, vegan, organic, and plant-based options, reinforcing its alignment with health and fitness trends. Its private-label Sprouts Brand, known for clean ingredients and high quality, has grown to represent about 24% of total sales, appealing to wellness-driven customers seeking trustworthy, better-for-you products.\n\n\n\nOver the years, Sprouts has expanded beyond its original store model, now operating over 440 locations in 24 states, with plans to enter new Midwest and Northeast markets. A notable operational enhancement has been the creation of a proprietary distribution network for fresh produce, meat, and seafood, improving both product freshness and supply chain efficiency. These efforts strengthen its competitive edge in delivering health-oriented perishable goods at consistent quality levels, a critical factor in customer retention and brand trust.\n\n\n\nThe company has also embraced digital transformation to meet evolving consumer preferences. Online sales now account for roughly 15% of total revenues, supported by delivery partnerships with Instacart, DoorDash, and Uber Eats. Sprouts’ loyalty program provides personalized offers to customers engaged in health, nutrition, and sustainability. In 2024, 30% of total sales came from organic products, while plant-based offerings grew 27%. Beyond retail, Sprouts invests in community well-being through its Healthy Communities Foundation, donating over $35 million since 2015. Environmental initiatives such as reducing plastic waste, promoting reusable bags, and supporting local food banks further integrate sustainability into its identity. This combination of product innovation, operational improvement, and community engagement has helped solidify Sprouts’ position in the growing health and wellness retail sector.\n\n\n\nSunOpta operates as a food and beverage company focused on products that align closely with health, wellness, and sustainability trends. Its portfolio centers on plant-based and fruit-based offerings, with leading categories including oat, almond, soy, and coconut-based beverages, as well as frozen and shelf-stable fruit products. The company also develops innovative healthy snacks, catering to consumer demand for nutrient-rich, minimally processed foods. SunOpta’s products are designed for both retail and foodservice markets, supplying major brands, private-label programs, and its own proprietary lines. This focus positions the company as a key player in the health and fitness space, providing clean-label and plant-forward options that resonate with today’s wellness-conscious consumers.\n\n\n\nOver the years, SunOpta has evolved from a diversified natural products business into a more streamlined, high-growth platform centered on plant-based and fruit-based foods. Strategic investments have expanded its beverage production capacity, improved manufacturing efficiencies, and supported product innovation. The Zacks Rank #2 company has prioritized expanding its oat-based beverage line, capitalizing on the rapid growth of the dairy alternatives market. In fruit-based foods, it has leveraged long-standing supply relationships and advanced processing capabilities to deliver high-quality products year-round. These steps reflect a shift toward scalable, high-margin categories closely linked to health and nutrition trends.\n\n\n\nSunOpta’s approach integrates sustainability with product development, enhancing its alignment with health and fitness values. The company emphasizes sourcing transparency, waste reduction, and responsible water use, while also introducing new plant-based and organic SKUs to meet evolving dietary preferences. Recent initiatives include expanding co-manufacturing partnerships, launching value-added fruit snacks, and optimizing its innovation pipeline to target emerging wellness niches. By narrowing its focus, upgrading facilities, and leaning into consumer demand for plant-forward nutrition, SunOpta has steadily transformed into a more agile, brand-relevant business positioned for long-term growth in the health and wellness sector.\n\n\n\nThe Beachbody Company has built a comprehensive health and fitness ecosystem that blends digital workouts, nutrition, and mindset coaching. Its flagship platform, BODi, offers around 140 full streaming programs and nearly 10,900 unique videos, including well-known titles like P90X, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, and 80 Day Obsession. Alongside workouts, BODi markets premium nutritional products such as Shakeology, Beachbody Performance supplements, and BEACHBAR, designed to support weight management, digestion, and overall well-being. This integration of fitness, nutrition, and mental wellness under the “Health Esteem” philosophy positions Beachbody as a full lifestyle solution provider.\n\n\n\nOver time, Beachbody has shifted its business model to adapt to changing consumer needs. Historically reliant on a multi-level marketing structure driven by “Partners,” the company undertook a major change in late 2024 — dubbed “The Pivot.” This transition replaced multi-level marketing (MLM) with a streamlined, single-level affiliate model, removing Partner subscription fees and lowering operating expenses. The company, with a Zacks Rank of 2, now focuses on direct-to-consumer sales through its website and retail partnerships. Access to content has also become more flexible through subscription bundles, à la carte offerings, and the Total Solution bundle, which pairs fitness memberships with Shakeology.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Beachbody is expanding into physical retail to broaden its reach. Shakeology products are scheduled to hit store shelves in late 2025, followed by P90X and Insanity-branded nutritional products in 2026, supported by new fitness programs under these brands for cross-promotion. Innovation continues with targeted wellness solutions, such as Belle Vitale for women’s hormone health and offerings for users of GLP-1 weight-loss medications. These moves keep the company aligned with evolving health and wellness trends while creating new growth avenues. By integrating content, product innovation, and channel expansion, Beachbody has steadily evolved its role in the health and fitness market.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Revenues increased 19% year over year to $694 billion and beat the consensus mark by 1.4%. This came above the company’s revenue expectation of at least $682 million. Connected TV or CTV once again emerged as the fastest-growing channel, driven by expanding partnerships with major media players, such as Disney, NBCU, Netflix, Roku and Walmart. Kokai continues to deliver strong performance.\n\nOn the profitability front, adjusted EBITDA came in at $271 million compared with $242 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS was 41 cents, missing estimates but up from 39 cents in the year-ago quarter, with free cash flow at $117 million.\n\nNonetheless, intense competition in the ad tech space amid increasing macroeconomic uncertainty are keeping investors on the sidelines. So, now the question arises whether investors should remain invested in TTD stock or book profits and exit. Let’s unpack the pros and cons and ascertain the best way forward.\n\nFactors Driving Growth for TTD\n\nIncreasing digital spending in CTV remains a key growth driver. CTV, along with retail media, accounted for much of the company’s growth, supported by The Trade Desk’s decision-based programmatic approach, which delivers better returns compared with insertion order or programmatic guaranteed buying.\n\nIn the second quarter, Video, which includes connected CTV, accounted for a high-40s percentage of its overall business and continues to increase its share of the mix in the quarter. Mobile contributed a mid-30s percentage share of total spend, while display made up a low double-digit share and audio comprised approximately 5%.\n\nApart from CTV, momentum in retail media, international expansion, the Kokai platform, and efforts to strengthen go-to-market capabilities are other tailwinds.\n\nMore than 70% of the clients are now using the company’s Kokai platform, with full client adoption expected to be completed by this year. Trade Desk highlighted that Samsung saw a 43% improvement in audience targeting efficiency for an omnichannel, while Cashrewards experienced a 73% improvement in cost per acquisition for campaigns in Asia. Adding Koa AI technology across the platform is expected to aid in attracting more clients.\n\nComplementing Kokai, OpenPath is simplifying the programmatic supply chain by allowing publishers to integrate directly with The Trade Desk’s platform. Sincera's acquisition is enhancing supply chain transparency through OpenSincera, which makes data available to the ecosystem for free. TTD is also upbeat about Deal Desk, which is currently in the beta stage. Deal Desk leverages AI forecasting to optimize deals and re-route underperforming deals to better open market and premium internet alternatives. Disney is already leveraging Deal Desk.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:15.956489+00:00"}

It’s the first (or, well, maybe second) significant move of Paramount’s new Ellison era.\n\nElbow Strike\n\nLive sports rights remain the lifeblood of media companies, and UFC’s time on the market provoked nothing short of a bloody cage match. Paramount’s final offer ultimately beat out fellow competitors Netflix, YouTube, Amazon and ESPN, according to a Bloomberg report over the weekend. The agreement, which runs from next year through 2032 and includes a payment schedule weighted more toward the back end of the deal, also trumps UFC’s current rights agreement with ESPN, valued at $550 million annually. After spending big on an NFL rights re-up, which even included giving up a 10% stake in itself to the league, ESPN appears to be paring back elsewhere; the Disney-owned company similarly backed out of renewing rights to Formula 1 Racing earlier this summer.\n\nFor Paramount, the deal could help transform its struggling streaming division. For UFC-owner TKO Group, it’s just the second blow in a recent one-two rights-sale punch:\n\nThe deal gives Paramount the rights to 30 “Fight Nights” per year, as well as 13 “marquee events.” All content will stream on Paramount+, with some being simulcast on CBS; Paramount+ accounts for just 2.2% of all streaming usage, according to a recent Nielsen report.\n\nThe deal puts an end to UFC’s pay-per-view era, while bringing it into the streaming age. WWE, TKO’s other fighting brand, just signed a five-year, $1.6 billion deal to stream marquee WWE events (such as WrestleMania) on ESPN’s forthcoming streaming service; WWE’s weekly show, RAW, began airing on Netflix in the US this year as part of a 10-year, $5 billion deal.\n\nWall Street had a mixed reaction to the mixed martial arts news: TKO’s stock soared more than 10%, while Paramount’s (now trading as $PSKY) fell 3.7%.\n\nIn a Corner: TKO may soon score a third leg in its ring-corner stool: boxing. Last month, a bipartisan group in the House of Representatives introduced legislation that would allow new ventures in the sport to launch outside of existing sanctioning bodies. (In news to us, boxing has been regulated by the US government since the organized crime-filled days of the 1950s.) That comes as TKO looks to launch a new boxing promotion as part of a joint venture with funding from Saudi Arabia.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:19.204571+00:00"}

It has since recovered some of those losses but remains up just slightly year-to-date -- underperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nHere's why Amazon is out of favor, along with the biggest mistake investors make when buying the growth stock.\n\nAmazon's underwhelming guidance\n\nAmazon reported excellent quarterly results, including growing operating income far faster than revenue. However, its third-quarter guidance and anticipated growth slowdown in Amazon Web Services (AWS) may be reasons for the stock's pullback. The AWS results are particularly jarring, considering Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) Azure and Alphabet's (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) Google Cloud are growing more quickly than AWS.\n\nWhat's more, Amazon's free cash flow plummeted to $18.2 billion for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $53 billion for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024. The company is deploying excess cash back into the business to invest in big ideas, such as building out AWS data centers, launching generative AI tools, expanding Amazon Prime delivery capabilities, and more. And yet, Amazon's third-quarter guidance calls for just 10% to 13% revenue growth and between an 11% decline in operating income and an 18% increase.\n\nAmazon's aggressive capital allocation strategy\n\nThe biggest mistake investors make when buying Amazon stock is not realizing that the company's modus operandi is plowing profits back into innovative ideas rather than booking short-term profits. Amazon takes a lot of risks, most of which have paid off and led to phenomenal long-term gains for patient investors. But this strategy also produces inconsistent earnings per share and cash flow. Amazon has fallen at least 25% from its all-time high three times in the last decade -- showcasing the stock's volatility.\n\nAmazon's stock-based compensation regularly exceeds its buybacks. Amazon hasn't repurchased stock in years, and it doesn't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, its stock-based compensation is over $20 billion for the trailing 12 months, and its outstanding share count continues to climb as Amazon dilutes existing shareholders.\n\nThis is a far different approach from other big tech giants like Apple (AAPL 1.13%), Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (META 3.16%). Like Amazon, these tech giants shell out billions in stock-based compensation each year to attract top talent, but they more than offset this expense with buybacks, which avoid dilution. In fact, having buybacks outpace stock-based compensation accelerates earnings growth by lowering the number of outstanding shares.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is ramping up spending in the pursuit of long-term growth. As you can see in the following chart, the company has grown its operating income at an impeccable pace over the last five years, but it has also magnified its capital expenditures.\n\nAWS remains the undisputed leader in the global cloud market, but its dominant market share is partly due to its entrenched position in the industry. In this vein, Amazon is making the right decision to reinvest profits in AWS to expand capacity and build out its AI capacity to bolster its competitive advantages. But investors will want to see these investments pay off.\n\nThe good news is that Amazon's valuation has gotten much more attractive as its earnings have grown and the stock price has stagnated. Amazon commands a 33.9 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- which is nearly identical to Microsoft's 33.6 forward P/E ratio.\n\nThe best way to approach Amazon stock\n\nInvestors who buy and hold Amazon stock must do so for the right reasons. Amazon's capital spending is surging, and if Wall Street doesn't see these investments pay off, the stock could keep tumbling.\n\nAmazon tends to get a shorter leash than other mega-cap names, so buying the stock requires a high risk tolerance. But this shorter leash is by design, as Amazon could easily pull back on spending and boost its cash flow or return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\n\nInvestors looking for a company with a more balanced capital allocation may want to consider Microsoft or Alphabet as preferred cloud plays over Amazon. However, Amazon is a decent valuation for folks looking to invest in the cloud and who believe in the strength of Amazon's core e-commerce and advertising business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:23.357825+00:00"}

Twenty years ago, the largest companies in the land hailed from the oil and industrial industries. For example, in 2005, the largest companies in the U.S., measured by market cap, were ExxonMobil and General Electric, worth $392 billion and $375 billion, respectively. Now, two decades later, technology enterprises, particularly those involved in artificial intelligence (AI), are at the top of the charts.\n\nThree of the world's most recognizable companies are at the forefront. AI chipmaker Nvidia leads the field at $4.3 trillion, within striking distance of a new all-time high. Software and cloud purveyor Microsoft also appears poised to climb to new heights, recently climbing to $3.9 trillion. Rounding out this tech trifecta is iPhone maker Apple at $3.1 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of $2.3 trillion, it might seem a bit premature to predict Amazon's (AMZN 0.08%) admission. After all, fair-weather investors have fled, and the stock is flat so far this year, weighed down by tariff-related uncertainty. However, other segments of Amazon's business appear poised to spark a renaissance in the company's growth, securing its membership in the $3 trillion club.\n\nThe tariff conundrum\n\nThe Trump administration's tariff policies remain in flux, and the resulting uncertainty is weighing on Amazon's stock. That's easy to understand, as third-party merchants generate roughly 62% of unit sales, and many of these goods are sourced from China. A recent deal set a minimum levy of 30% on Chinese imports, while some products are saddled with a higher rate. The recent trade agreement notwithstanding, investors are wary of the ongoing impact on Amazon's e-commerce sales.\n\nResults from the second quarter and Amazon's forecast seemed to confirm their worst fears. Overall net sales increased 13% year over year to $167.7 billion, with 61% of its revenue from digital sales or third-party seller services. The company's third-quarter outlook is telling. While Amazon is forecasting revenue growth of 11.5% at the midpoint of its guidance, it expects operating income to be essentially flat, in no small part thanks to tariffs.\n\nPartly cloudy\n\nThe good news is that its cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), won't be directly affected by tariffs. For context, AWS generated 19% of Amazon's revenue and 58% of operating income so far this year, helping insulate the company somewhat from tariffs.\n\nFurthermore, AWS is the worldwide leader in cloud infrastructure services, with a market share of 32% in Q1, according to market analyst Canalys. Furthermore, the segment is growing at a respectable pace, with sales of $31 billion representing a roughly 18% increase.\n\nGrowth has reaccelerated over the past year, driven by rising demand for AI. In June, CEO Andy Jassy pulled back the curtain, revealing that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and apps in development or already built, and the company plans to create many more. \"AI will be a substantial catalyst,\" Jassy said.\n\nAmazon's cloud customers represent a captive audience and target market for its AI products and services, which will be a catalyst for future growth.\n\nA distinct \"ad\"vantage\n\nAnother area fueling Amazon's growth is advertising, which is by far the company's fastest-growing segment. Ad revenue grew 23% year over year to $15.7 billion in Q2, and now accounts for more than 9% of total revenue. Its growth has expanded beyond in-search advertising, driven by Amazon Prime, live sports programming, Fire TV, and Twitch -- the company's live-streaming gaming platform.\n\nAmazon also recently inked deals with Roku and Disney to drive future growth. The company now reaches more than 80% of connected TV (CTV) households in the U.S., significantly expanding the reach of its advertising.\n\nThe path to $3 trillion\n\nAmazon has a market cap of roughly $2.32 trillion as of this writing, so it will only take a stock price increase of about 29% to boost its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $708 billion in 2025, resulting in a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would need revenue of roughly $914 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting Amazon's growth to be roughly 10% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that target, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2028. That might well be conservative, as Amazon has grown its annual revenue by 561% over the past decade, and by 13% in the most recent quarter, fueled by demand for cloud and AI services.\n\nFurthermore, at 33 times earnings, Amazon trades at a slight premium compared with a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500 -- yet has generated stock price gains of 719% over the past 10 years, far exceeding the S&P 500, which rose just 202%. This makes a compelling case that Amazon stock is attractive at this price.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:24.712756+00:00"}

The professional and business services industry itself shed 14,000 jobs. This data points to a cooling labor market, fueling concerns of a slowing economy.

Monday's launch came after several delays for weather issues.\n\nOn the stock market today, Amazon stock is down a fraction at 221.82 in recent action.\n\nWhat Is Amazon's Project Kuiper?\n\nIn a letter to shareholders last year, Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy described Project Kuiper as a \"very large revenue opportunity.\" It will compete against Starlink's service for residential and enterprise customers, as well as government contracts.\n\nJassy was similarly optimistic during a call with Amazon stock analysts late last month. He said Kuiper will have performance advantages and \"compelling\" pricing.\n\n\"I think that we will have a pretty meaningful differentiation here in performance,\" Jassy told analysts following Amazon's Q2 earnings report.\n\nAt the current pace of satellite launches, however, analysts have questioned Amazon's ability to reach the total required by the FCC.\n\n\"We're working very hard to get the satellites into space,\" Jassy said following the Q2 report. \"We have some delays with some of the rocket providers, but we have most of the available rocket launches over the next couple years and were very helpful to get the service into commercial beta later this year or early next year.\"\n\nAmazon Stock Analysts Debate Kuiper\n\nAmazon stock slid 8% following the company's Q2 results last month and is trading roughly flat this year. Shares took a hit largely because growth for the Amazon Web Services cloud business disappointed compared with Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\nBut Amazon's Project Kuiper investments have also been debated among stock analysts over the past year. The company has committed to spend at least $10 billion on the effort. There are concerns that will weigh on margins for the North American retail operations at Amazon, given the lack of immediate revenue.\n\n\"What investors are most worried about are weak AWS margins, investments in Kuiper and Alexa, tepid earnings guidance, and higher capital expenditures,\" Needham analyst Laura Martin wrote to clients following Amazon's Q2 report. She reiterated a buy call for Amazon stock.\n\nStill, some analysts are bullish on the revenue potential for Project Kuiper and its ability to power further space-based services from Amazon.\n\n\"Assuming Amazon has just a 30% consumer share (Starlink already has 6 million subs), we see a $7.1 billion 2032 revenue potential for Amazon,\" BofA Securities analyst Justin Post wrote to clients last month. \"We also expect Kuiper to have synergies with Amazon's logistic network, and the project to generate additional revenues from AWS's enterprise and government customers.\"\n\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool, meanwhile, shows Amazon stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of a best-possible 99. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAmazon's First Link-Up With OpenAI Wins Cheers On Wall Street\n\nWhen To Sell Growth Stocks: This Could Be Your No. 1 Rule\n\nGet Timely Buy & Sell Alerts With IBD Leaderboard\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:38.226592+00:00"}

Tesla also said its purpose-built robotaxi was still scheduled for volume production starting in 2026.\n\nTesla posted second-quarter revenue of $22.5bn (£16.6bn) compared with $22.64bn expected by Bloomberg consensus. This is a 12% drop compared with the $25.05bn reported a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.40 compared with expectations of $0.42, while operating income of $923m was also lower than the expected $1.23bn.\n\nShares in Tesla ( TSLA ) fell in after hours trading following the release of its second-quarter earnings , as electric vehicle (EV) company slightly missed Wall Street estimates.\n\nWith that in mind, here's more detail on how the Mag 7 companies are performing so far.\n\nHowever, the latest deadline expired on 7 August , after which Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs came into effect. Further announcements around duties since then and continued uncertainty over Trump's future tariff plans loom over markets, as the second half of the year gets underway.\n\nThis was followed by pauses on the US implementing higher tariffs on certain trading partners, extending the deadline by which they had to negotiate trade deals, which offered some relief to investors.\n\nUS president Donald Trump's unveiling of sweeping tariffs on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\" on 2 April also rocked the Mag 7, as well as markets more broadly.\n\nThese questions were front of mind when going into the first earnings season of the year, in addition to increasingly high expectations from investors as to what to expect from the performance of these companies.\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cheaper AI model in January raised questions over the level of spending on the technology by the major US companies and rattled investors.\n\nThe latest earnings season has been another test for the group, some of which had recovered more recently following a turbulent start to 2025.\n\nMany of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants have now reported their latest quarterly earnings, with the results receiving a mixed response from investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Tesla’s headwinds are getting worse and investors are becoming less enamoured with the business.\n\n“Competition is fierce, tariffs are biting, the end of tax credits for electric vehicle buyers in the US could hurt, Elon Musk’s political escapades have been a turn-off for many people, and product innovation has failed to make waves.\"\n\nCEO Elon Musk's public feud with US president Donald Trump, following his departure from the Department of Government Efficiency, has weighed on Tesla shares. · Chesnot via Getty Images\n\n\"A push into more affordable vehicles implies a drop in profit margins, while the hope of being big in self-driving cars remains a fantasy rather than reality,\" said Mould. \"The Cybertruck product line hasn’t filled the treasure chest for the company, and for many the Tesla brand has become toxic because of Musk’s outspoken views.\"\n\nTesla shares are already down nearly 18% year-to-date despite rising as CEO Elon Musk stepped back from Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and said he planned to put more time back into the EV company.\n\nMusk's public feud with Trump, following his departure from Washington, has weighed on the stock.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of Tesla vehicles have continued to fall, amid backlash against Musk's political activities, with the company also facing increasing competition from rival EV makers.\n\nIn figures released early in July, Tesla delivered 384,122 vehicles globally in the second quarter, a drop of 13.5% for the same period last year.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) – Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 23 July\n\nSecond-quarter results from Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) topped Wall Street estimates, with revenue of $96.43bn versus expectations of $93.97bn. Earnings were $2.31 per share compared with a Bloomberg consensus estimate of $2.18.\n\nOn a business segment level, advertising revenue came in at $71.3bn versus expectations of $69.6bn. Search revenue topped out at $54.1bn versus an anticipated $52.7bn. YouTube ad revenue was $9.8bn versus expectations of $9.5bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud Platform revenue hit $13.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $13.1bn.\n\nThe company's outlook for capital expenditures (capex), however, was higher than expected. The tech giant expects to spend $85bn in the year, $10bn more than had been previously expected.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nBen Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the concerns around disruption from artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, Alphabet produced a really good set of numbers in its latest results. Revenues were up 15%, three percentage points better than expected and the search business delivered at the top of its range. The cloud business, meanwhile, was also a strong performer with revenues up 32% so it is encouraging to see the business growing strongly in the face of pressures.\"\n\nHe said that the increase in its capex guidance \"is a very solid raise and should be viewed as a positive, with investment looking to drive away the threat of Chat GPT\".\n\n\"Alphabet has been playing catch up somewhat in the AI arms race, but it is doing well to fend off the likes of Chat GPT,\" said Barringer. \"The big question will be whether it can keep innovating at a pace that allows it to maintain its search monopoly. This boost in investment suggests the fight will continue.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the next big event on the horizon for Alphabet's Google is a judge's ruling in an search antitrust case. Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to issue a ruling on \"remedies\" that follows the Justice Department's victory against the company sometime next month.\n\n\"While it is unlikely to be the end of the saga regardless of the result, any indication that its search monopoly will weaken will not be taken well by the market, especially given the AI threat currently,\" said Barringer. \"This ruling has the potential to either be a clearing event or add to Alphabet’s uncertainties. Investors remain very much in wait and see mode as a result and will remain cool on the stock until that ruling makes it clear what the next steps are.\"\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) – Released fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday 30 July\n\nShares in Microsoft (MSFT) popped nearly 5% on Thursday, following the release of its results, seeing it become the second publicly-traded company ever to cross the $4tn market capitalisation mark.\n\nMicrosoft reported revenue of $76.4bn in the fourth quarter compared to expectations of $73.89bn, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $3.65 compared to expectations of $3.37.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes the Azure cloud, produced $29.88bn in revenue in the final quarter. For the entire fiscal year, this AI division saw revenue surge 34% to a record $75bn.\n\nThe company predicted its capital expenditure for the next fiscal year would top $100bn, a 14% increase from the year prior.\n\nRead more: Shell announces further $3.5bn in share buybacks as profits beat estimates\n\nIt’s the fifth quarter in a row that Microsoft has beaten Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nBarringer said that \"while AI demand is clearly helping Microsoft, it isn’t the only game in town for the tech giant. Its cloud business, Azure, saw revenues grow 39%, well ahead of expectations, highlighting that demand for more traditional cloud based services remains strong. Microsoft has a good backlog in this business area too so we should see strong results continue to flow there.\n\n“The company did announce it was slowing the growth of its capex and changing the mix slightly, but as demand remains strong for AI we will likely see the likes of data centres take priority for a number of years yet.\n\nMeta (META) – Released second quarter results on Wednesday 30 July\n\nFacebook-parent Meta (META) surged 12% on Thursday after posting a bumper set of results after the market close on 30 July.\n\nMeta said revenue for the three months to the end of June rose 22% from the same period last year to $47.5bn. Meanwhile, profits jumped by 36% to $18.3bn. Profit per share came in at $7.14, above analysts' estimates.\n\nThe company said it expected its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114bn and $118bn. The company added its AI initiatives will “result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.”\n\n\"I think there are all these questions that people have about what are going to be the timelines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence ... we've observed the more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen. I think that that just continued to happen over the course of this year too,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nReality Labs logged an operating loss of $4.53bn while recording $370m in sales during the same period. This division oversees the Quest line of virtual reality headsets in addition to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company plans to build several massive data centres across the US. · Reuters / Reuters\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Meta has knocked it out of the park. Pick your metric and Meta crushed it, from ad revenue growth to daily users, all the way down to the profit lines.\n\n\"AI is clearly delivering real-world benefits for advertisers, and they're willing to pay more as a result. Average price per ad was up 9% over the quarter, a clear indication that Meta is delivering an improved product for both users and advertisers.\n\n\"The broader focus now turns to Meta's mammoth AI investment plans and whether it can continue to manage those costs without hurting earnings or free cash flow.\n\n\"CFO commentary called out higher costs next year, and another year of similar capex growth, which many analysts did not have on their bingo cards. Clearly, all this spending adds some near-term risks to the bottom line, but Meta looks set to be a clear winner in the AI space over the longer term.\"\n\nApple (AAPL) – Released third-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nInvestors in Apple (AAPL) had a muted response to its latest earnings in after-hours trading following their release, despite a surge in iPhone sales driving record revenue at the Cupertino-based company.\n\nThe company posted better-than-expected 10% growth in revenue year-on-year for the quarter to the end of June and an upbeat forecast.\n\nEarnings of $1.57 per share topped the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $1.43. Revenue of $94.04bn was better than the expected $89.30bn. Mac and iPhone revenue were both better than analysts had anticipated, while wearables and iPad numbers fell short. Greater China revenue was $15.37bn compared to an estimate of $15.19bn.\n\nApple expects tariffs to cost the company $1.1bn this quarter, CEO Tim Cook told investors on the earnings call. That's after the iPhone maker took a tariff-related hit to the tune of $800m during the fiscal third quarter which ran through June.\n\nServices revenue, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Pay, came in at $27.4bn, up about 13% year-on-year, continuing its double-digit growth.\n\nCook said Apple (AAPL) was increasing its AI investments. “We did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter,” he told analysts, without giving specific numbers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook warned in a second quarter earnings call at the beginning of May that tariffs were expected to add $900m to costs in the third quarter. · REUTERS / Reuters\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Britzman said: \"Apple is caught in a sentiment trap. On paper, the company delivered one of its strongest sets of results in recent years – robust iPhone sales, a return to growth in China, and encouraging guidance. Ordinarily, that would send shares meaningfully higher. There’s a sense of unease hanging over Apple, something we haven’t seen in a long time. Scepticism around its AI positioning, combined with lingering tariff uncertainty, continues to weigh on investor confidence.\"\n\n\"Apple should be a leading name in AI hardware, but that’s simply not the case,\" he added. \"Apple Intelligence was a flop, so a lot of hope now lies in an AI-powered Siri – but that might not come until next year. Brand loyalty gives Apple time to get the AI transition right, but it needs to start delivering.\"\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – Released second-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nShares in Amazon (AMZN) fell on the back of its second quarter results, as its outlook for operating income fell short of investor expectations.\n\nThe tech company beat estimates with its revenue up 13.3% year over year to $167.7bn. Market experts had estimated the company would report around $162bn in revenue and 9% growth. The company’s Amazon Web Services cloud computing division reported its sales reached $30.9bn in an increase of 17.5% year over year.\n\nHowever, Amazon projected that operating income in the third quarter would be $15.5bn-$20.5bn, which fell short of analyst expectations of $19.4bn.\n\nChief executive Andy Jassy warned of further uncertainty around Trump’s tariff policies and said he remained “unsure” who would absorb potentially higher costs over time.\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nHe also gave a clear indication that the e-commerce giant will continue its AI push. \"AI is going to be the biggest transformation of our lifetime,” he said during a call with analysts on Thursday. “Every single area of the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by AI.\"\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Just as it looked as if investors were ready to go all-in to big tech again, Amazon has come along and spoiled the party. A negative reaction to its results and a lacklustre response to Apple’s numbers would suggest the market has become more discerning.\"\n\n\"It is spending big on AI infrastructure, leading to more subdued profit guidance than expected,\" he said. \"The retail side of its business is caught up in Trump’s spiderweb of tariffs, which creates ongoing uncertainty.\"\n\n“Competition remains fierce for cloud computing services and Amazon’s sales growth rate is struggling to match rivals Microsoft and Alphabet,\" Coatsworth added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 27 August\n\nAs an enabler of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings have become a major event in the earnings calendar, with some build up to the release of its results as it tends to report later in the season.\n\nInvestor expectations have become increasingly high around Nvidia's earnings, with markets sensitive to any signs of slowdown for the chip giant.\n\nThe stock has seen a marked rebound following turbulence in the first few months of the year amid the DeepSeek AI market shock and Trump's tariff agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed curbs on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China in April. Shares popped last week after the company said that it would resume sales of its H20 chips in China. Nvidia said that the US government had assured the company that licences will be granted, with the chipmaker adding that it hoped to start deliveries soon.\n\nThe recovery in Nvidia shares since mid-April lows has meant the stock is now up 25% year-to-date and recently saw the company become the first publicly traded company to pass the $4tn market capitalisation milestone.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia beat expectations, posting revenue of $44.1bn compared with an expected $43.29bn. The chipmaker guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2% for the second quarter.\n\nGoing into the second-quarter earnings, Britzman warned that investors shouldn't expect \"any meaningful impact\" from the recent turnaround on H20 chip curbs, given the timeframe.\n\n\"However, taking a conservative view, new Chinese sales could drive a $10bn uplift in revenue by year-end, potentially more if things move fast,\" he said. \"NVIDIA may also be able to reverse some of the $4.5bn inventory write-down from the first quarter, providing a direct boost to earnings.\"\n\nHe added: \"Outside of China, overall demand remains critical. Markets have already heard from major customers that data centre expansion is a priority, which should benefit Nvidia.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:42.802687+00:00"}

Including growth stocks in a diversified portfolio can complement investments in other asset classes, like value stocks or dividend-paying companies.\n\nIf you have cash to put to work right now and want to put some of that to work in growth-oriented businesses, here are two stocks to consider buying right now and holding indefinitely.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) continues to demonstrate its abilities as an e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse in a rapidly evolving business landscape. In the second quarter, Amazon's e-commerce business, which includes online stores and third-party seller services, accounted for approximately $102 billion out of its total $167.7 billion in net sales, up 11% year over year. That represented roughly 61% of Amazon's total revenue for the quarter.\n\nThe company's other core growth catalyst is Amazon Web Services (AWS). While not accounting for as large a piece of the business as e-commerce does, it remains Amazon's leading driver of profitability. AWS delivered $30.9 billion in revenue in Q2 alone, an 18% increase year over year and accounting for about 18% of Amazon's total net sales in Q2 2025. In terms of profitability, AWS generated $10.2 billion in operating income in the three-month period, which was more than half of Amazon's total operating income of $19.2 billion for the quarter.\n\nAnother key area to watch as its long-term growth runway evolves is Amazon's advertising segment. In Q2, Amazon generated $15.7 billion in ad revenue, which was a 23% increase from the same quarter one year ago. While that revenue figure is still a relatively small piece of the pie for Amazon, the growth rate surpassed the increase in its core retail business and highlights the role this asset-light segment could play in the years ahead.\n\nAWS is one key part of the business that showcases Amazon's evolving approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies like machine learning (ML). For example, Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that simplifies the development and scaling of generative AI applications. It uses a selection of foundation models from various AI companies and Amazon's own models, and also facilitates the creation and deployment of AI agents.\n\nBeyond Bedrock, AWS provides a wide range of AI services, including SageMaker (a fully managed ML service for building, training, and deploying ML models at scale), Amazon Q (a generative AI-powered assistant for businesses and developers), and Amazon Connect (a cloud-based contact center solution that uses AI for purposes like AI assistants).\n\nAmazon's continued status as the world's leading e-commerce company and its aggressive investments in AI could make it a compelling buy for investors of all trading styles and interests. Amazon still looks like a smart stock to buy and hold forever.\n\n2. Carnival Corp.\n\nCarnival Corp. (CCL 3.62%) is known for being the world's largest cruise company, operating multiple cruise lines that cater to various travel preferences across ages and budgets. Carnival owns and operates Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Cunard, Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, and Seabourn.\n\nCarnival demonstrated a remarkable recovery since the pandemic-induced shutdowns, but it has still faced challenges related to its substantial debt burden acquired during that era. And, of course, there are now growing concerns that macro developments could turn and consumer spending might falter, affecting businesses like Carnival's.\n\nThe good news is that the company has consistently reported occupancy rates above pre-pandemic levels, reaching 104% as of the end of Q2 2025. Carnival had a strong second quarter overall as well, reporting record revenues of $6.3 billion, and it exceeded its own guidance by more than tripling adjusted net income. Customer deposits also hit an all-time high of $8.5 billion. Bookings for 2025 are at an all-time high in both pricing and occupancy, and early bookings for 2026 are even showing similar strength.\n\nAs a whole, the cruise industry is attracting younger travelers and first-time cruisers, which is proving to be the tide that lifts all boats. Last year, Carnival's revenue reached an unprecedented $25 billion in fiscal year 2024, a 15% increase year over year. The company also achieved its first annual profit since the pandemic in 2024, reporting a $1.9 billion profit driven by increasing operating income and expanding margins.\n\nCarnival has been actively reducing its substantial debt load, which increased significantly during the pandemic's height. For example, in May of this year the company refinanced $993 million of 7.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2026. The new notes are priced at 5.875% maturing in 2031, which is expected to save over $20 million in annual interest expenses through 2026.\n\nWith the stock trading up nearly 100% over the last year alone, it seems that many investors are growing bullish about the company. If you have the risk tolerance to put cash into the cyclical cruise industry, Carnival is looking like an increasingly attractive buy in this space.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:51.307164+00:00"}

Still, the latest government reports showing hiring has cooled while services inflation resurfaced is starting to weigh on sentiment, raising uncertainty about the pace of interest-rate cuts. The latest economic data “magnifies the importance” of this week’s CPI report, JPMorgan Chase & co. strategists wrote in an August 5 note.\n\nTo Karl Schamotta of Corpay Inc., the way to navigate the risk of stagflation is to stick to defensive sectors like utilities, communications services and consumer staples while shunning growth-focused sectors like consumer discretionary. To him, the extra challenge comes from balancing expectations for rising prices against US President Donald Trump’s pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower rates.\n\n“This is a turning point in the economy that we stand at and markets are really unsure as to what direction we’re going to go in,” said Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay. “We need to worry that a Fed that’s less focused on its price stability mandate is going to allow inflation to be higher over time.”\n\nAcross Wall Street, uncertainty about a return of 1970s-style stagflation has economists and strategists concerned the Fed will hold interest rates steady, eliminating a key catalyst for the stock market.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index, which has climbed 8.6% so far this year, dropped after a weaker-than-expected jobs report earlier this month and an uptick in services inflation.\n\n“In a stagflationary environment, it is dangerous to cut without clear evidence that inflation has peaked,” Bank of America economists wrote in a note, reiterating their call the Fed will remain on hold for the balance of the year even with weaker jobs numbers.\n\n‘Stagflationary Shocks’\n\nTorsten Slok, partner and chief economist at Apollo Management, prefers sectors like telecommunications, healthcare, utilities and technology that are less impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty and tariffs.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:53.007845+00:00"}

Investors were not enthused. The stock dipped 10% and is now trailing the valuation of its big technology peers, with Nvidia and Microsoft having market caps of around twice the size of Amazon today. Wall Street is concerned about slower growth in cloud computing and Amazon falling behind in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis pins the stock down on one topic when in reality Amazon has all the ingredients to keep growing its profits over the long term, which is what will drive the share price higher. Here's why Amazon -- with a market cap of $2.3 trillion right now -- can finish 2025 valued at over $3 trillion.\n\nMore profits arriving in e-commerce\n\nThe biggest reason for Amazon's profit expansion in its e-commerce division the last few years is advertising. High-margin advertising revenue has grown from $7.4 billion in the second quarter of 2021 to $15.7 billion last quarter, and is still growing 22% year over year. This division has now generated $61 billion in revenue over the last 12 months and has incredibly strong profit margins.\n\nAdvertising, along with growth in third-party seller services, subscription revenue, and operating leverage over its fixed cost base, has enabled Amazon's North American retail division to expand its profit margin to 7% over the last 12 months. Through the rest of 2025, there is plenty of room for this expansion to keep occurring, which will have a large impact on profitability given how much revenue the division generates ($400 billion over the last 12 months). Even slight profit margin enhancements mean billions of dollars in extra earnings for Amazon.\n\nThe same thing is happening in international markets, where Amazon has a 3.4% operating margin on $150 billion in revenue. These segments are behind North America but have the same business model at the end of the day, meaning there is even more room for margin expansion over the long haul.\n\nOver $500 billion in annual revenue for segments growing revenue in the double digits means Amazon can add tens of billions of dollars in earnings power from North America and international retail in the years to come just by expanding its profit margin slightly each year. Through the rest of 2025, this story will continue to unfold.\n\nSustained cloud computing tailwind\n\nA once shining star of Amazon's business, cloud computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the reason for the stock falling after its latest quarterly result. Revenue grew 17.5% for AWS in the quarter, which was well behind competitors Microsoft and Alphabet.\n\nEven though AWS is growing slower than its peers, it will still benefit greatly from the AI revolution, especially because of its relationship with Anthropic. The fast-growing AI start-up is seeing booming revenue and is planning to spend a boatload of money at AWS, its key partner. This can drive an acceleration of revenue growth for AWS through the rest of 2025. With over $130 billion in annualized sales, AWS is on a path to hitting close to $150 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of 2025.\n\nIts profit margin is also strong, at 37% over the last 12 months. A strong profit margin and fast revenue growth mean huge earnings gains for AWS, which will lead to consolidated earnings gains for Amazon.\n\nThe math to a $3 trillion valuation\n\nOver the last 12 months, Amazon has generated $76 billion in operating income and $70 billion in net income. Through continued margin expansion in retail and fast growth at AWS, both of these figures can keep chugging higher through the end of 2025. In 2026, it is likely that Amazon's annual earnings will be close to or exceed $100 billion.\n\nToday, Amazon trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 33. The S&P 500 index trades at a P/E ratio of close to 30. A forward P/E ratio of 30 and $100 billion in 2026 earnings means that Amazon would trade at a market cap of $3 trillion by the end of this year. That is the math behind Amazon's potential in 2025, and why the stock is set to surge in the next few quarters. Buy Amazon stock and hold on tight for the long term.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:54.646368+00:00"}

The cohort consists of:\n\nNvidia NVDA 0.58% ) Microsoft MSFT 1.44% ) Apple AAPL 1.13% ) Amazon AMZN 0.08% ) Alphabet GOOG 1.25% ) GOOGL 1.14% ) Meta Platforms META 3.16% ) Tesla TSLA 0.54% )\n\nAll of these companies (except for Nvidia) have reported results, and investors may be curious as to which ones look like solid buys. I think all of these stocks are growing more interesting each day, but of the seven, I think five are a buy and two are to be watched.\n\nI'm keeping an eye on Apple and Tesla\n\nOver the past few years, many of these companies have delivered explosive revenue growth, except for Apple. Apple's growth finally returned in Q3 FY 2025, delivering double-digit growth (if you round up) for the first time since early 2022.\n\nStill, there are some questions about being behind in the AI arms race and what Apple's next big product is. I'm not ready to declare Apple a buy yet, but it's growing more intriguing with each quarter.\n\nTesla is in the worst shape of any Magnificent Seven company, with revenue falling 16% year over year in Q2. Additionally, with EV and regulatory credits getting eliminated, significant headwinds are popping up. However, Tesla's business has never been solely about EVs; otherwise, its valuation wouldn't make sense. An investment in Tesla is a bet that its humanoid robots, AI, self-driving, and rob-taxis will all be successes eventually. But for right now, I'm comfortable waiting on Tesla's situation to improve.\n\nI'm a buyer of the remaining five\n\nThe other five members of the Magnificent Seven all look promising to me, as they're all experiencing strong growth.\n\nMeta Platforms delivered a shocking Q2 report that delivered 22% revenue growth despite only guiding for 13% growth. That strength is expected to continue through Q3, with 20% revenue growth expected.\n\nMeta's advertising business is second to none, and the improvements it's making with AI to aid in ad creation and engagement are starting to pay off.\n\nAlphabet similarly had a strong advertising quarter, despite many investors being worried about Google Search potentially being left behind by generative AI. Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year, showcasing its strength and silencing doubters about its longevity.\n\nCompanywide, Alphabet's revenue rose 14% year over year, with diluted earnings per share rising 22%. That's an impressive result from a company that is supposed to be struggling. Additionally, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading for 20 times forward earnings.\n\nAll of this combines to make Alphabet one of the best stocks to buy right now.\n\nDespite Microsoft being the second-largest company in the world, it delivered monster growth in Q4 FY 2025 (ended June 30). Revenue was up 18% year over year, but the biggest shock in its report was Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing product and is a leading platform for building AI models. Azure's revenue was up a jaw-dropping 39% this quarter, showcasing strong demand for computing power.\n\nThis tailwind will persist for some time, making Microsoft an excellent stock to scoop up now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) investors had a negative reaction to its report, which caused shares to sink following earnings. However, I don't think they were as bad as the market thought, and the long-term outlook is still positive for the company.\n\nAmazon's profit growth continues to outpace revenue growth thanks to the strength of high-margin businesses like advertising and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAs long as this trend continues, Amazon will be a strong long-term pick. With both advertising and AWS being Amazon's fastest-growing segments by far, this trend looks primed to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nLast is Nvidia, which hasn't reported earnings yet. However, all of the companies involved in building out AI infrastructure on this list stated that their capital expenditures will be rising next year due to increased data center spend. This bodes well for Nvidia, as it receives a huge chunk of this spend. Additionally, Nvidia has reapplied for its export license to begin shipping H20 chips to China again, which will provide another growth tailwind for its business.\n\nI expect Nvidia to report blowout earnings on Aug. 27, making the stock a smart stock to scoop up before then. Nvidia may be the world's largest company, but I expect it to get even bigger with increased AI buildout.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:56.545588+00:00"}

SK Hynix's projections are conservative and include constraints such as available energy, he said.\n\nBut the memory business is undergoing a significant strategic change during this period as well. HBM - a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 - involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, helping to process the large volumes of data generated by complex AI applications.\n\nSK Hynix expects this market for custom HBM to grow to tens of billions of dollars by 2030, Choi said.\n\nDue to technological changes in the way SK Hynix and rivals such as Micron Technology and Samsung Electronics build next-generation HBM4, their products include a customer-specific logic die, or \"base die\", that helps manage the memory.\n\nThat means it is no longer possible to easily replace a rival's memory product with a nearly identical chip or product.\n\nPart of SK Hynix's optimism for future HBM market growth includes the likelihood that customers will want even further customisation than what SK Hynix already does, Choi said.\n\nAt the moment it is mostly larger customers such as Nvidia that receive individual customisation, while smaller clients get a traditional one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n\"Each customer has different taste,\" Choi said, adding that some want specific performance or power characteristics.\n\nSK Hynix is currently the main HBM supplier to Nvidia, although Samsung and Micron supply it with smaller volumes. Last week, Samsung cautioned during its earnings conference call that current generation HBM3E supply would likely outpace demand growth in the near term, a shift that could weigh on prices.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:53:58.374272+00:00"}

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe rules of the e-commerce game are always shifting.\n\nBefore Amazon became mainstream, eBay was the platform to master. That's where many successful e-commerce entrepreneurs got their start, including software developer Leo Limin.\n\nWhen Limin started listing smart bulbs on Amazon in the mid-2010s, sales were \"very easy,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nBuilding a profitable Amazon business has become increasingly difficult over the last decade, and winning strategies come and go.\n\n\"Amazon keeps changing the rules,\" said Limin, who has responded by shifting gears within his own career. In 2018, he created a software called RebateKey that would distribute rebates on behalf of sellers looking to share their newest products with customers. \"Sellers would benefit a lot from it, but then Amazon changed the rules again, and the rebates no longer worked.\"\n\nLimin, whose latest project is a user-generated content platform called JoinBrands, still sells on Amazon, \"but mostly for staying in touch with the industry.\"\n\nHe said it's still possible to succeed in e-commerce, but sellers need to look beyond Amazon.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n'If you're not on TikTok Shop, you are disadvantaged'\n\nLimin and other e-commerce veterans agree that to stay ahead in such a competitive industry, leaning into TikTok is key.\n\nTikTok Shop is the platform's built-in e‑commerce feature, which allows users to discover and purchase products within the app. It officially launched in the US in 2023.\n\n\"TikTok Shop created this ecosystem where everybody can be a seller, so everybody can become your affiliate,\" explained Limin. \"And it's very good. It's explosive. If you're not on TikTok Shop, you are disadvantaged right now.\"\n\nEugene Khayman, who also started selling on eBay before transitioning to Amazon, agrees. He built a seven-figure business selling kitchen items online, and now spends most of his time and energy working closely with elite sellers as the COO of Million Dollar Sellers (MDS).\n\n\"If people are treating Amazon as their whole business, they're definitely more at risk. There are so many different verticals of e-commerce to serve,\" he said.\n\nTikTok Shop reminds Khayman of Amazon in its early years. \"I think that there's a lot of opportunity there,\" he said, and advises a hybrid approach, coupling Amazon with TikTok.\n\nEugene Kayman is the cofounder and the COO of Million Dollar Sellers, a community of elite e-commerce entrepreneurs. Courtesy of MDS\n\nNot all products are a great fit for TikTok Shop, as entrepreneur Kyle Goguen has found. He runs two brands: Pawstruck, a natural dog treats company he launched in 2014, and CRBN, a pickleball paddle company that he and his childhood friend co-founded in 2021.\n\nWhile Pawstruck products are listed on TikTok Shop, Goguen said the pickleball paddles are not the best fit for this specific marketplace.\n\n\"A big part of it is our price point,\" he explained. CRBN paddles range from $180 to $280. \"The nature of TikTok Shop is more of a price-conscious shopper. There are some exceptions to that, but generally speaking, it is challenging to convert someone at a high price point. That's just not how the effective videos are working unless you have a product that is just super viral in nature.\"\n\nHe agrees that TikTok Shop is where many sellers are finding success in 2025, outside Amazon, but it comes with its own set of challenges.\n\n\"It is a very, very different platform than Amazon as a marketplace, good and bad,\" said Goguen. \"I think there is a potential faster path to success and huge growth on TikTok Shop — it is a little bit like the Wild West, like the early days of Amazon. However, it is far less repeatable and reliable than Amazon as a marketplace.\"\n\nCRBN Pickleball cofounders and childhood friends, Kyle Goguen and Garrett Gosselin. Courtesy of CRBN Pickleball\n\nTikTok LIVE selling is the 'new QVC'\n\nIf you really want to get ahead in the e-commerce industry, learn the ins and outs of live selling.\n\n\"It's like QVC to a new generation,\" said Limin. \"It's people selling on a livestream. It's a skill — there are more and more creators that can do it very well — and some brands sell through thousands and thousands of items in a matter of a couple of hours, like $50,000 worth of products, for example, in two hours. But, not only that, brands are using lives now as customer support.\"\n\nMultiple platforms offer live selling, including TikTok, Amazon, YouTube, Instagram, and Whatnot.\n\nLive commerce is already very popular in China, said Limin, who predicts a live selling boom in the US in the next couple of years.\n\n\"At JoinBrands, we are paying a lot of attention to now educating creators how to sell live because we know it is the future,\" he said. \"If, before, the United States was telling the world how to sell, now it is China. If you look at what's happening in China, it is what's going to happen in the United States in two or three years — and, in China, live selling is huge, so I deeply believe and a lot of sellers also believe that live selling will come here and stay.\"", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:04.733253+00:00"}

But these two segments that make up 6% of GDP have been playing a bigger role in fueling the expansion so far this year, on average.\"\n\nIn other words, a relatively small slice of the economy is growing so fast that it’s become the dominant growth story for the whole economy.\n\nReview of the macro crosscurrents 🔀\n\nThere were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our last review:\n\n👎 Inflation expectations heat up. From the New York Fed’s July Survey of Consumer Expectations: \"Median inflation expectations in July increased at the one-year-ahead horizon to 3.1% from 3.0% and at the five-year-ahead horizon to 2.9% from 2.6%.

According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.63% from 6.72% last week. From Freddie Mac: \"The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to its lowest level since April. The decline in rates increases prospective homebuyers’ purchasing power, and Freddie Mac research shows that buyers can save thousands by getting quotes from a few different lenders.\"\n\n(Source: Freddie Mac)\n\nThere are 147.9 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.1 million are owner-occupied and about 39% are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows.

Student loans saw another uptick in the rate at which balances went from current to delinquent due to the resumption of reporting of delinquent student loans.

Until we get more clarity, here’s where things stand:\n\nEarnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nBut growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.\n\nActions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nStocks are not the economy: There’s a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nMind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nInvesting is never a smooth ride: There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nThink long-term: For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:06.691233+00:00"}

Despite some big instances of volatility and risk factors along macroeconomic and geopolitical lines, the S&P 500 has risen roughly 7% across 2025's trading and isn't far removed from its all-time high.\n\nOn the other hand, some strong businesses have actually seen significant valuation contractions this year -- and taking a buy-and-hold approach to the best of the bunch could be a path to fantastic returns. If you're looking for top stocks trading at substantial discounts compared to their all-time highs, read on to see why two Fool.com contributing analysts think that these industry-leading companies stand out as great investment opportunities right now.\n\nAmazon stock: Down 12% from its high\n\nKeith Noonan (Amazon): Sometimes, the market has a gut reaction to a company's earnings report that seems to miss the forest for the trees -- and these instances can sometimes present big opportunities for investors. I think Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) stock is one of those types of opportunities on the heels of its recent second-quarter report.\n\nThe technology and e-commerce giant notched per-share earnings of $1.68 on revenue of $167.7 billion, which crushed the average analyst estimate's target for earnings per share of $1.33 on sales of $162.11 billion. Despite the very strong quarterly results, Amazon stock saw a significant pullback following its second-quarter report.\n\nAmazon stock is down roughly 2.5% across this year's trading, and its share price is down approximately 12% from its all-time high.\n\nThe company guided for high levels of spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to continue, and some investors were concerned about the near-term impact the big build-out initiative will have on profitability.\n\nAmazon's Q2 report also arrived the same day that disappointing July jobs numbers were reported and the day after the Trump administration unveiled a series of new tariffs, which certainly didn't help set the stage for a big post-earnings rally. Amazon's recent business execution and Q2 results don't seem to have gotten all the kudos they probably deserve, but that will likely change with time.\n\nHeavy spending on AI infrastructure, robotics, and other potentially explosive growth drivers will certainly put some pressure on Amazon's earnings in the near term, but making big investments in these categories is probably among the smartest things the company can be doing right now. Amazon's recent quarterly report was a reminder of the company's strengths, and the stock looks like a great portfolio addition for long-term investors.\n\nTarget stock: Down 62% from its high\n\nJennifer Saibil (Target): Target (TGT 2.21%) has been a massive disappointment for shareholders over the past few years. It's been dealing with problems as fundamental as lower consumer discretionary spending and as fleeting as negative public opinion about its political beliefs. However, there are many signs of light amid the darkness, and Target stock's low price looks compelling for long-term investors.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025's first quarter (ended May 3), sales were down 2.8% from last year, and comparable sales (comps) were down 3.8%. However, digital comps were up 4.7%, driven by a 36% increase in same-day services from its membership program. This category has been a bright spot in Target's reports throughout this challenging time. It's a good indication that loyal customers are finding value, and under better circumstances, Target can rebound.\n\nToday's operating environment is still hostile to a retailer like Target, which is a discount retail chain focused on discretionary shopping. Unlike Walmart, which is one of the country's biggest grocers, Target's sweet spots are categories like apparel and home improvement. Home improvement in particular is still suppressed since the real estate industry has been in a funk.\n\nTarget tends to perform well under better conditions, and that's likely to happen again. In the meantime, it continues to upgrade the digital platform and loyalty program, where growth is happening.\n\nTarget is a Dividend King, an exclusive status applied to companies that have raised their dividends for at least 50 years straight. It means the dividend is reliable, which is a crucial feature for many dividend investors, and that you can count on it to grow. With the stock down roughly 62% from its high, Target's dividend yields 4.4%, or more than three times the S&P 500 average.\n\nAs the S&P 500 continues to rise, it's getting harder to find bargains, but Target stock is still cheap. It trades at a forward, one-year P/E ratio of roughly 13, which makes it a great time to buy for long-term investors, especially if you're looking for passive income.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:12.313976+00:00"}

More concerning, the company's core commerce revenue (online sales, physical stores, and third-party services) grew at around 5% to 6%, much lower than the numbers above after excluding advertising and subscription revenue.\n\nAnd despite its gigantic size -- net sales reached $126 billion in the first quarter of 2025 -- it had an operating profit of just $6.8 billion, or 5.4%. That margin might be acceptable for a grocery store. But for a tech giant with massive infrastructure costs, it limits how much the retail engine can contribute to long-term earnings power.\n\nTo make things tougher, Amazon faces growing competition from low-cost, well-positioned challengers like Temu and Shein. These newcomers are leveraging ultra-lean supply chains and social virality to win younger consumers -- and they're increasingly encroaching on categories like apparel, beauty, and home goods.\n\nThe silver lining? Amazon isn't standing still. Its logistics network is becoming more efficient, with faster delivery speeds and lower costs per package. It's also pushing hard on its own low-cost e-commerce (Amazon Haul) to overcome Temu and Shein.\n\nStill, investors will want to see Amazon prove it can sustain even modest growth -- and expand margins over time for its commerce segment. Otherwise, this red flag could remain a drag on the stock, even as other business lines post better numbers.\n\nGreen flag: Amazon's advertising business is quietly exploding\n\nIf retail is showing signs of fatigue, advertising might be Amazon's next growth engine.\n\nIn Q1 2025, Amazon's ad revenue jumped 18% year over year to $13.9 billion, making it one of the largest digital advertising platforms globally. Moreover, advertising is a high-margin business, meaning it may eventually contribute more to the bottom line than the retail business.\n\nWhat makes Amazon ads unique isn't just impressions. It's intent. Amazon reaches customers at the moment they're ready to buy -- giving it higher conversion rates than search or social platforms. And with its massive trove of first-party purchase data, Amazon offers brands a powerful platform for targeted marketing.\n\nBut advertising doesn't end on Amazon's shopping sites. The recent move to introduce ads in Prime Video has opened a new chapter. With hundreds of millions of global Prime members, Amazon now runs one of the largest ad-supported streaming platforms in the world.\n\nEven Google and Meta Platforms can't fully match this.\n\nThat's because Amazon owns the entire customer journey -- from ad exposure, to product search, to purchase -- all within its ecosystem. This closed-loop attribution model allows brands to track precisely how ads turn into sales.\n\nFor example, a user might see a product placement on Prime Video, tap an ad on their Fire TV, and complete the purchase on Amazon's app -- all while feeding Amazon's flywheel of shopping and behavioral data. That kind of end-to-end visibility is gold for marketers.\n\nWhat does it mean for investors?\n\nAmazon isn't just an e-commerce company anymore.\n\nWhile retail remains a critical piece of its empire, it's becoming clearer that Amazon's long-term profit engine will come from high-margin businesses like cloud computing and advertising. In particular, the ad business is gaining real momentum, with unique advantages that could drive years of growth.\n\nYes, retail faces challenges. But if Amazon can stabilize commerce and let other faster-growing segments do the heavy lifting, the stock could still compound over time.\n\nFor long-term investors, understanding which parts of Amazon are growing -- and which are not -- may be the key to seeing the company's future.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:13.875302+00:00"}

This summer, it is Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) that has begun to fall behind the pack.\n\nThe cloud computing, e-commerce platform, and logistical infrastructure giant saw its stock drop 10% from highs after reporting slower growth in its cloud computing division compared to the competition. However, if you are an investor focused on the long term, you know that it is better to focus on the broad forest while Wall Street looks at the individual trees.\n\nHere's why Amazon stock is set to soar for the rest of the decade and can become larger than Nvidia and Palantir combined in 2030.\n\nFalling behind in cloud computing?\n\nIn the second quarter, Amazon's cloud computing division -- Amazon Web Services, or AWS -- posted 17.5% revenue growth to $30.9 billion. Or, an annualized rate of $123.6 billion. However, this was much slower growth than the competition such as Microsoft Azure, which posted 34% revenue growth due to its large relationship with OpenAI, which is spending like gangbusters on cloud computing services.\n\nInvestors see this dichotomy in growth as a warning sign for AWS. Is it falling behind Microsoft? While it would be nice if Amazon won the OpenAI relationship, it is not getting left out to dry in AI.\n\nAWS has a large relationship with Anthropic, the second-largest AI start-up, which is valued at close to $200 billion. Revenue for Anthropic is exploding, hitting $5 billion in annualized sales in July compared to $4 billion a month prior. Anthropic has committed billions of dollars to spend on AWS, which will help accelerate revenue growth for the division.\n\nWhile Microsoft and others have narrowed the gap, AWS is still the leader in cloud computing today and should benefit from the rising tide of AI spending in the years to come. This will drive revenue and earnings higher for the segment. Operating income was $43 billion for AWS over the last 12 months, and could rise to close to $100 billion by 2030.\n\nA margin expansion story\n\nInvestors may have forgotten the original heartbeat of Amazon's business: e-commerce and its Prime subscription service. North American e-commerce sales are still growing in the double digits, up 11% last quarter to $100 billion and $404 billion over the last 12 months. International -- which includes Western Europe, Japan, and India, among other regions -- has hit $150 billion in trailing-12-month sales.\n\nGrowth of 22% in advertising services is driving margin expansion for Amazon's retail divisions. Over the last 12 months, North American retail has an operating margin of 7% and international a margin of 3.4%.\n\nThis is while Amazon keeps reinvesting in moonshot projects such as Alexa and Project Kuiper, as well as reinvestments into fast delivery services into rural areas of the United States. As these investments either bear operating leverage or are phased out, Amazon's retail divisions will keep expanding profit margins. I expect North American margin to scale to at least 15% due to advertising revenue and 10% for international by 2030, although the path will likely not be linear.\n\nWhy Amazon can beat Nvidia and Palantir\n\nWhich brings me back to Nvidia and Palantir, two behemoths with a combined market cap of $5 trillion. There are three reasons I think Amazon can outpace these AI winners and be the largest company in the world by 2030.\n\nFirst, Amazon has two growth engines at its back: cloud computing and e-commerce/retail. This greatly expands Amazon's addressable market. Even with its overall revenue pushing past $670 billion, there is still plenty of room for the company to keep growing its sales in the years to come. Margin expansion will lead to even high profits for the company.\n\nSecond, Amazon is a customer of Nvidia. It aims to reduce its reliance on the advanced computer chip maker, with its Trainium chip taking on more capacity every quarter. This is market share being taken away from Nvidia.\n\nThird, Amazon has a much cheaper valuation than Nvidia or Palantir. Nvidia has a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 41 compared to 33 for Amazon. Palantir's is a sky-high 278 and will be a major drag on the stock in the coming years. Add it all up, and I think Amazon has a chance to have a much larger market cap by 2030 while Nvidia and Palantir will struggle to grow, making Amazon a better buy for investors at current prices.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:15.334412+00:00"}

Plenty is an agriculture technology company that develops plant sciences for crops to flourish in a pesticide and GMO-free environment. The ag-tech company received a $200 million investment from Bezos Expeditions during its Series B funding.\n\nNextDoor was acquired by Khosla Ventures Acquisition Co. II, a special-purpose acquisition company, in 2024. The current share price as of July 25, 2025, is $1.88, with a market cap of $719.27 million.\n\nDuring Series B funding in 2013, Bezos Expeditions followed super-investor David Sze with an investment in the private social media app, Nextdoor. This free app connects people who live in the same community and provides access to posts about neighborhood safety, jobs, lost pets and local politics.\n\nAccording to the EverFi website, the company is “fulfilling the need for scalable education in an ever-changing world.” Blackbaud, a cloud software giant, acquired EverFi for $750 million in 2022, and it’s unknown if Bezos has any involvement at this point.\n\nIn April 2017, Bezos invested $190 million from his cash flow during a Series D funding round for EverFi.

Bezos has built a wide-ranging portfolio through Amazon, his venture capital firm Bezos Expeditions, Nash Holdings LLC and the Bezos Family Foundation.\n\nWhen one of the world’s wealthiest individuals makes an investment , it’s worth paying attention. As the fourth richest person in the world with a net worth of $244.5 billion, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is one such person whose strategy is worth taking note of.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAirbnb\n\nThe extremely popular accommodation marketplace provides access to millions of unique places to stay in more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries, and it received a Bezos investment of $112 million, according to a Visual Capitalist report.\n\nAirbnb priced its IPO at $68 per share in December 2020, giving it a $47 billion valuation, which indicated that Bezos would earn a decent payday. Currently, shares are trading at $141.31, and it has a market capitalization of over $87.22 billion.\n\nGrail\n\nBezos appears to be trying to make the world a better place by supporting companies like Grail, a healthcare company focusing on detecting cancer early before treatments become too invasive.\n\nIn 2016, Bezos Expeditions invested $100 million in Grail. Grail raised over $2 billion in funding and announced an IPO in September 2020, but just one week later, Illumina announced it’d buy the company for $8 billion and that Bezos would be bought out.\n\nMark43\n\nBezos Expeditions invested $27 million in Series B financing for Mark43 in April 2016.

Wall Street analysts believe that shares could shoot up in the short term as there is optimism over potential earnings growth.\n\nUber\n\nBack in 2011, Bezos invested $37 million in Uber’s Series B funding round. The popular ride-sharing and food delivery app went public in 2019 at $45 per share, valuing the company at $82.4 billion. As of July 25, 2025, the stock is trading at $91.29 a share and has a market cap of $190.9 billion.\n\nDomo\n\nIn 2013, Bezos invested $60 million in Domo, a company connecting CEOs to their front-line employees with access to real-time data and insights, allowing them to manage the business from their smartphones.

Additional products include several other tools that help companies overcome tech challenges. With over 23 million registered users and over 100 million monthly visitors, Stack Overflow is one of the world’s most popular websites.\n\nBezos was an early investor through Bezos Expeditions, which went on to fund at least one additional round of financing. However, Stack Overflow was sold for $1.8 billion to Prosus in 2021, and whether Bezos is still involved is unknown. The popular question-and-answer website is trying to utilize the power of AI, and it has integrated generative AI into its platform.\n\nFigure AI\n\nWith the rise in prominence of AI-powered tools, Bezos Expeditions started focusing on this field. Last year, Bezos Expeditions, along with Nvidia and Microsoft, participated in a funding round for Figure AI to help raise $675 million at a $2.6 billion valuation.

Furthermore, internal combustion engines still dominate the market. Investors looking to gain exposure to the future of transportation are often torn between growth-heavy start-ups like Rivian (RIVN 0.34%) and legacy automakers like Ford Motor Company (F 0.99%). Both have compelling narratives -- but only one stands out today as the better buy.\n\nLet's break down the case for each.\n\nRivian: Ambitious growth, heavy costs\n\nRivian once captured investor imagination with its sleek trucks and Amazon-backed promise. Fast-forward to 2025, and the company remains a speculative play, albeit one that's secured a lifeline from Volkswagen (VWAGY 2.02%).\n\nAccording to Rivian's first-quarter 2025 financials, the company posted a net loss of $541 million. This is a good improvement from the $1.44 billion lost in the first quarter of 2024, but continues its pattern of deep losses as it ramps up production. A good thing to mention is the shift from gross losses of $527 million in 2024 to a gross profit of $206 million in Q1 2025. Still, Rivian continues to struggle with cash burn and supply chain inefficiencies.\n\nThe big bright spot for Rivian is its strategic partnership with Volkswagen, which includes a $5 billion investment and joint development of next-gen EV platforms. This alliance provides a much-needed vote of confidence and access to global scale. However, a major new factory planned under this deal is going to cost Rivian a lot of money and could take years to pay off.\n\nInvestors buying Rivian today are essentially betting that the company will not only survive but thrive after enduring years of costly expansion. It's a long runway -- but also a risky one.\n\nFord: A legacy auto that's built to last\n\nFord may not carry the same hype as Rivian, but it has things Rivian sorely lacks: scale, cash flow, and a dividend. Ford has put together four years in a row of solid revenue growth. Yes, annual net income is a bit up and down, but that's the nature of the car industry, especially when you've been pumping money into new things like EVs.\n\nThe company has leaned into EVs with its popular F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E while still maintaining a strong lineup of internal combustion vehicles that provide steady income. Even more importantly, Ford assembles over 80% of its vehicles in the U.S., giving it a relative advantage in the face of rising tariffs under the Trump administration.\n\nAs reported by Yahoo! Finance, Ford expects to weather the tariff storm better than some of its rivals like General Motors, looking at a $2 billion (after offsetting $1 billion) bill versus higher estimates from GM. Still, Ford's business is not immune, since many of its parts are still sourced globally. But compared to start-ups and foreign automakers, Ford's domestic production base offers a meaningful cushion.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Ford looks attractive. Its stock trades at a modest multiple of 14 times earnings, and it offers a reliable dividend yield of around 5.43% -- something growth-hungry Rivian can't match. Plus, after selling most of its stake in Rivian last year, Ford has sharpened its focus on its own EV ambitions.\n\nThe better buy\n\nThere's no denying that Rivian has potential. Its alignment with Volkswagen is a meaningful endorsement, and its brand is resonating with younger, affluent buyers. But as of today, it remains a speculative investment, with a high burn rate and no profits in sight.\n\nFord, on the other hand, offers investors value, income, and relative geopolitical insulation relative to many competitors. While it too faces challenges -- especially from supply chain disruptions and legacy costs -- it's better positioned to ride out short-term volatility. And for investors looking to combine stability with EV upside, Ford is the more compelling pick.\n\nVerdict: Ford is the better buy today. It might not make you filthy rich overnight, but the dividend and low price tag make it a safer and more appealing play within the auto industry.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:20.729612+00:00"}

The vast majority of his $200-plus billion net worth comes from Amazon stock and related ventures, per Forbes.\n\nBezos’s wealth isn’t just tied to Amazon, though; ventures like Blue Origin and a range of investments in technology, media and space industries have fueled his ascent. Industry analysts say this flexibility is critical: While blue-chip assets like Amazon keep his portfolio formidable, Bezos is always scanning for emerging opportunities that can keep his net worth climbing.\n\nIn July, Bezos made headlines by selling $5.7 billion in Amazon shares, barely a dent in his overall holdings, according to Fortune. Even when Amazon stock wobbles, the rest of his investments and ventures provide a ballast, helping him weather sudden shifts far better than most.\n\nWatch Out: 4 Reasons You Might Regret Moving To Florida for Retirement\n\nFlorida’s Massive Economic Machine\n\nFlorida’s population boom powered the state to new heights in 2025, reaching a record 23.3 million people, according to the U.S. Census figures.

Meta Platforms (META 3.16%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%), Amazon (AMZN 0.08%), and Apple (AAPL 1.13%) all reported second-quarter earnings, and while they were mostly positive in different ways, artificial intelligence (AI) continued to be a strong trend. That's great news for Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) investors. Let's see what's happening and why investors should get excited about what Nvidia will have to say when it reports quarterly earnings later this month.\n\nWinning with AI\n\nAI has become an enormous growth driver for tech companies, and really all kinds of companies. It unlocks productivity and aids in creativity in ways that make it essential if a company doesn't want to be left behind.\n\nAmazon said that its AI business through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division continues to grow at triple digits year over year, \"with more demand than we have supplied for at the moment.\" It's launching all sorts of new features as demand grows and changes, and releasing powerful new tools aimed at developers creating large language models and in need of the highest-power AI chips. It also boasted that it rolled out new EC2 instances, a type of virtual server on the AWS cloud supported by new Nvidia Blackwell \"super chips,\" the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) on AWS.\n\nAmazon spent $31.4 billion on capital expenditures, which it says is a reasonable estimate for the back half of the year. Although that could be in many parts of the business, it said the AI business is where most of it is going. That means it could be spending even more than the original $100 billion it said it would spend in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft boasted that its Azure cloud business is grabbing market share, up 34% year over year in the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter (ended June 30), and that it now has 400 data centers, the most of any other cloud business. Management highlighted that while there's industry talk about the first gigawatt or multi-gigawatt data centers, it launched two gigawatts of power in its data centers over the past 12 months, and it's scaling faster than the competition.\n\nAt Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed many exciting developments in AI, including the launch of Meta Superintelligence Labs, which combines all of the company's AI efforts, and progress on upgrades to its Llama LLMs. In April, Nvidia announced its own involvement in the new Llama developments. Zuckerberg said Meta is working on the next generation of products \"that will push the frontier in the next\n\nyear or so.\" Meta has made headlines over the last few weeks as it crafts a team of AI specialists it's been pulling from rival companies.\n\nApple continues to disappoint, or at least confuse, investors with its AI developments. It's taking its time to develop an AI infrastructure that rivals the competition, and it's questionable whether or not it's losing ground or if it's going to eventually release something different and special, which is its signature. Management said it's making substantial investments in AI and that its capital expenditures are going to increase.\n\nAlthough investors seemed disappointed in Apple's AI updates, there's no question that it provided an excellent report, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines, and it's likely to report progress in Apple Intelligence over the coming quarters.\n\nDriving AI\n\nThe common denominator here is Nvidia, which partners with all of these companies. It provides the power for Amazon's and Microsoft's clientele to develop potent LLMs and AI agents, and they also use Nvidia GPUs for the data centers that drive their own LLMs. Meta uses Nvidia's GPUs for its own LLMs and AI agents, and Apple partners with Nvidia for its AI business as well.\n\nNvidia is guiding for sales to increase about 50% over last year in the fiscal second quarter, which it will report on Aug. 27. Its quarterly results usually beat guidance, but with the success and continued capital investments of its top-tier clients, it's very likely that it will beat sales guidance and give shareholders a strong outlook.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:29.708764+00:00"}

Startups from OpenAI to Anthropic have raised tens of billions of dollars.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBut there’s a downside to the new technology that investors are increasingly taking note of: It threatens to upend industries much like the internet did before it. And investors have started placing bets on just where that disruption will occur next, ditching shares in companies some strategists expect will see falloffs in demand as AI applications become more widely adopted.\n\nAmong them are web-development firms like Wix.com Ltd., digital-image company Shutterstock Inc. and software maker Adobe Inc. The trio are part of a basket of 26 companies Bank of America strategists identified as most at risk from AI. The group has underperformed the S&P 500 Index by about 22 percentage points since mid-May after more or less keeping pace with the market since ChatGPT’s debut in late 2022.\n\n“The disruption is real,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the Futurum Group. “We thought it would happen over five years. It seems like it is going to happen over two. Service-based businesses with a high headcount, those are going to be really vulnerable, even if they have robust businesses from the last era of tech.”\n\nSo far, few companies have failed as a result of the proliferation of chatbots and so-called agents that can write software code, answer complex questions and produce photos and videos. But with tech giants like Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. pouring hundreds of billions into AI, investors have started to get more defensive.\n\nWix.com and Shutterstock are down at least 33% in 2025, compared with a 8.6% advance for the broad benchmark. Adobe has fallen 23% amid concerns clients will look to AI platforms that can generate images and videos, as Coca-Cola has already done with an AI-generated ad. ManpowerGroup Inc., whose staffing services could be hurt by rising automation, is down 30% this year, while peer Robert Half Inc. has shed more than half its value, dropping to its lowest in more than five years.\n\nThe souring sentiment among investors comes as AI is changing everything from the way people get information from the internet to how colleges function. Even companies at the vanguard of the technology’s development like Microsoft have been slashing jobs as productivity improves and to make way for more AI investments. To many tech-industry watchers, the time is nearing when AI becomes so pervasive that companies start going out of business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:31.622379+00:00"}

Stocks of growing companies will usually experience greater volatility than the market average. But investors that ignore those fluctuations and keep regularly buying shares of growing companies will come out ahead over the long run.\n\nThree fool.com contributors see great deals right now for fallen growth stocks like Amazon (AMZN 0.08%), Dutch Bros (BROS 2.00%), and Sweetgreen (SG 0.73%). Here's why they believe these stocks are solid investments for a long-term investor.\n\nAmazon: Down 8.5%\n\nJennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon reported spectacular results for the 2025 second quarter last week, but its stock dropped on the news. While there was a lot to be excited about, the market seemed to home in on certain qualities that didn't fully meet its expectations, and that has created an excellent opportunity for investors who haven't pressed the buy button yet.\n\nSales growth was strong at 13% year over year, beating expectations. Let's not forget that Amazon is the second-largest company in the U.S. by sales, and to be able to still deliver double-digit sales growth is an impressive feat. It reached $167.7 billion in sales, ahead of Walmart's $165.6 billion in sales in its most recent quarter, and Amazon is on track to become the largest company in the U.S. by sales.\n\nOperating income surged to $19.2 billion, up from $14.7 billion last year, easily topping its guidance. But that wasn't enough for Wall Street.\n\nThe market seems to have been spooked by the outlook for operating margin coming in slightly below expectations. Management is shooting for $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion in third-quarter operating income, and Wall Street is expecting $19.5 billion.\n\nIt also wasn't thrilled with the performance of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon's cloud business. AWS sales were up 17.5% year over year in the quarter, but that was nowhere near the growth of its two biggest rivals, Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet, which increased 39% and 32%. However, AWS is much bigger than both of them, and in dollar amounts, its increase surpassed them.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy made some remarks about the artificial intelligence (AI) business that may have sounded worse than he expected. He explained that it couldn't meet demand right now, which is why it's investing heavily in the platform. While that could lead clients to find somewhere else to meet their demand, the high demand implied should be great for Amazon down the line, as long as it can build out fast enough to keep it going.\n\nAmazon stock is down 8.5% from its highs, already making its way back up as investors recognize the opportunity to buy on the dip. This was an overcorrection, and now it's a great chance to buy before it reaches new highs.\n\nDutch Bros: Down 33%\n\nJohn Ballard (Dutch Bros): Dutch Bros has all the ingredients of a growth stock set up to deliver multi-bagger returns for patient shareholders. It's tapping into growing demand for specialty beverages. The business was founded in 1992, but it's still early in its nationwide U.S. expansion plans.\n\nAnalysts expect revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 23% over the next few years. This is in line with the company's current pace of shop openings and same-shop sales trends, which have hovered around the low to mid-single-digit level over the last few years. It currently has over 1,000 shops in 18 states, but management sees tremendous growth potential supporting as many as 7,000 locations over the long term.\n\nDutch Bros is outperforming Starbucks, which has experienced problems growing sales recently. One reason for Dutch Bros' success is that it likes to hire shop managers from within the company. Even some of the company's franchise partners started out working for Dutch Bros as \"broistas.\" This can help promote consistency throughout the company's shops, which is an important quality to look for in any restaurant chain.\n\nAnother quality that leads me to have high conviction in the future of this brand is that it is very popular among Gen Z. Dutch Bros offers a fun-loving atmosphere and a focus on the drive-thru experience, and it goes out of its way to delight customers with limited time offerings, such as the recent rubber duck giveaway with every purchase. The little things can go a long way in winning loyal customers, and Dutch Bros seems to understand this well.\n\nThe stock is currently down about 33% from its 52-week high. I would consider taking advantage of the dip and adding shares, especially for investors who are interested in finding promising new restaurant brands in the early stages of expansion.\n\nSweetgreen: Down 77%\n\nJeremy Bowman (Sweetgreen): Restaurant stocks have struggled this year as a combination of fears about tariffs and weak consumer discretionary spending have weighed on both business results and stock performance.\n\nSweetgreen, the promising fast-casual salad chain, has been one of the worst-performing stocks in the industry. The stock is now down 61% year to date, and is off 77% from its all-time high shortly after the company went public in late 2021.\n\nIt's understandable why Sweetgreen is down based on its recent results. In its first quarter, same-store sales declined 3.1%, and revenue rose just 5.4%. Sweetgreen has also been unprofitable throughout its history.\n\nHowever, the chain is still small with roughly 250 locations, and it is popular as its restaurants generate average sales of $2.9 million. That puts it on par with Chipotle, one of the most successful restaurant stocks in history.\n\nSweetgreen has also been unprofitable in part because it's invested in its Infinite Kitchen program, an automated system that measures and dispenses ingredients and helps prep its salad bowls. That innovation seems likely to pay off over the long run. Management has said that restaurants with the Infinite Kitchen generate higher sales, as it helps increase throughput and customer service, in addition to saving on labor costs.\n\nSweetgreen's comparisons are expected to get easier in the second half of the year, which could turn comparable sales positive. The company expects to open at least 1,000 stores over the long term, meaning it has a long growth runway ahead.\n\nInvestors who take advantage of the discount are likely to be rewarded.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:32.953763+00:00"}

Invest $250,000 in These 3 Stocks and Wait a Decade.", "summary": "These companies have what it takes to magnify investors' retirement nest eggs over the long run.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/09/want-1-million-in-retirement-invest-250000-in-thes/", "published_at": "2025-08-09T11:30:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "These companies have what it takes to magnify investors' retirement nest eggs over the long run.\n\nWhile $1 million may be a comfortable retirement goal for some investors, it's essential to personalize your savings target based on your specific circumstances and objectives for your life in your golden years. Even as there are multiple ways of shoring up your financial life to plan for a more secure future in retirement, building up a profitable stock portfolio is one key component you shouldn't overlook.\n\nNo investment, regardless of how quality the underlying business, is totally impervious to the ups and downs of the market. However, if you have a larger amount such as $250,000 to put to work into fantastic businesses, it isn't a far stretch of the imagination that you could turn that investment capital into $1 million in roughly a decade. In fact, with a starting amount of $250,000, that would require an annualized return of roughly 15%, which is just a bit higher than the average annual S&P 500 10-year return, including dividends (approximately 13%).\n\nAs you look to grow your personal nest egg to or above $1 million, here are three stocks to consider for your basket of buys that could warrant part or all of a $250,000 investment. Alternatively, you could distribute that $250,000 investment capital equally across these three stocks. Diversification is key for any stock market portfolio, so you can capitalize on the maximum sources of growth in your portfolio in a variety of stock market environments.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) remains a dominant force in several key markets, including online retail as well as cloud computing (AWS), and is bolstering a growing presence in newer arenas like digital advertising. Notably, AWS is the leading cloud provider and a major source of profitability for Amazon. Despite some concerns about slowing growth compared to competitors, AWS revenue continues to increase and benefits from the rising demand for cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nAmazon's advertising business is expanding rapidly too, fueled by its vast customer base and integration across its ecosystem (e.g., Prime Video, Twitch). Even though this segment still represents a relatively small portion of the company's overall net sales, this is the company's fastest-growing segment and could become increasingly important for the company's overall financial health in the next decade. Of course, Amazon remains the largest online retailer globally and accounts for about 40% of U.S. retail e-commerce sales alone.\n\nIn Amazon's Q2 2025, the company delivered a 13% year-over-year increase in net sales to $167.7 billion, while operating income rose 31% to $19.2 billion. AWS saw a 17.5% year-over-year increase in revenue to $30.9 billion. While Amazon's North America segment saw an 11% increase in sales to $100.1 billion, the International segment delivered a 16% increase to $36.8 billion.\n\nAnother bright spot was Amazon's advertising business, which climbed 23% year over year to $15.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $1.68, up 33% year over year.\n\nAWS remains a dominant force in the rapidly expanding cloud computing market. This market is projected for significant growth that could reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030 globally, driven by technologies like AI and machine learning. AWS is investing heavily in AI infrastructure, with planned capital expenditures exceeding $100 billion in 2025.\n\nThis positions AWS to expand rapidly based on the increasing adoption of AI workloads and cloud-based AI solutions. It's conceivable that Amazon's role in the forefront of AI innovation, its flagship e-commerce business, and advertising presence are among the myriad of factors that could drive multibagger returns for shareholders over the next decade and well beyond.\n\n2. Reddit\n\nReddit (RDDT 1.40%) is often called the \"front page of the internet.\" As a popular social news and discussion website where users share links, posts, and images, which are then voted on and commented on within specific communities called subreddits, Reddit is known for its vast array of forums, covering almost every topic imaginable. From niche interests to general news and entertainment, the platform is a place for Redditors around the globe to converge and participate in all manner of discussion.\n\nReddit boasts a highly engaged global user base, with over 110.4 million daily active users as of Q2 2025. User growth has been particularly strong, with daily active unique visitors climbing 21% year over year in Q2. Reddit's efforts to expand internationally with machine translation, which is now available in 23 languages, are widening the potential reach of the platform. Advertising forms the core of Reddit's revenue at this point, generating $465 million in Q2 2025, up 84% year over year and accounting for 93% of the total revenue.\n\nReddit's ability to offer advertisers highly targeted audiences within specific interest-based subreddits provides a compelling value proposition, which continues to lead to increased advertiser adoption and revenue growth. Beyond advertising, Reddit is actively exploring new revenue sources, like data licensing.\n\nThe platform's vast archive of user-generated content is a valuable asset for training AI models, and Reddit has successfully forged partnerships with major players like Alphabet's Google and OpenAI to license this data. Data licensing generated $35 million in revenue for Reddit in Q2 2025, a 24% increase from one year ago.\n\nReddit's growing user base, robust advertising business, and valuable data assets paint a picture of a business still in the early stages of its growth story despite a company history that already spans two decades. The company's recent turn to profitability also bodes well for its financial health, bolstered by its asset-light, sticky business. All these factors could drive considerable financial growth and lead to share price appreciation in the next decade-plus.\n\n3. Joby Aviation\n\nWhile the previous two picks on this list are established businesses with well-outlined revenue and profit streams, Joby Aviation (JOBY 5.57%) definitely falls into the category of a high-risk and potentially very high-reward stock. Joby is still pre-revenue and burning significant cash, but the future for this company could be bright indeed if it achieves its long-term business ambitions.\n\nThe company is focused on manufacturing and commercializing all-electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for air taxi services. Joby is currently developing a four-passenger, piloted aircraft designed for vertical takeoff and landing, similar to a helicopter, but transitioning to forward flight like a plane. It plans to generate revenue through multiple avenues, including operating its own air taxi service, selling aircraft to other operators, and potentially offering transportation services to government agencies.\n\nAs both an operator and a manufacturer, Joby could take a vertically integrated approach to urban air mobility. Joby already partnered with various companies, including Toyota, Delta, and Uber, to develop and deploy its air taxi service. Joby also has a significant contract with the Air Force, under which it will deliver and operate up to nine of its eVTOL aircraft to this and other federal agencies.\n\nAs of mid-2025, the company has entered the final stage for certification by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for commercial passenger operations. Joby also just acquired Blade Air Mobility's passenger business to accelerate commercialization of its eVTOL aircraft, a move that provides immediate access to Blade's existing network of vertiports, customer base, and operational expertise. Blade's existing customer base, which included over 50,000 passengers in 2024, also offers a significant head start for Joby in building demand for its eVTOL services.\n\nJoby is a leading contender in the eVTOL space, which is projected to become a trillion-dollar industry. Being an early mover with a strong technology and regulatory lead could translate to significant market share and profitability, which could also propel shares to soar a lot higher in the coming decade and beyond.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:34.286428+00:00"}

She pledged to give away at least half her fortune and quickly began making historic donations.\n\nRead More: I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Middle Class\n\nFind Out: Mark Cuban Tells Americans To Stock Up on Consumables as Trump's Tariffs Hit -- Here's What To Buy\n\nSince then, Scott has donated more than $17 billion to over 2,000 nonprofit organizations, with a focus on causes such as social justice, education, and economic equity. Her giving is not only generous but also strategic, designed to empower marginalized communities and support long-term change.\n\nThe impact of her donations has been described as transformational. In 2024 alone, she contributed $2 billion, continuing her trust-based approach with no strings attached. Her model prioritizes speed, flexibility, and impact, helping nonprofits advance their missions without the delays or restrictions that often accompany major funding.\n\nA Quiet But Bold Approach To Giving\n\nUnlike many high-profile philanthropists, Scott rarely seeks the spotlight. Her donations are large and come without naming rights, public recognition, or complex application processes. Instead, she and her small team proactively identify nonprofits — often led by women, people of color, and grassroots leaders — that are typically overlooked by traditional funders. They then issue large, unrestricted grants, giving recipients the freedom to use funds as they see fit.\n\nIn a 2020 blog post announcing $1.7 billion in donations, Scott wrote that her giving is guided by a belief that “people who have experience with inequities are the ones best equipped to design solutions.” That conviction underpins her entire philanthropic strategy.\n\nDiscover Next: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\n\nHow Her Philanthropy Stands Out\n\nScott’s giving style breaks nearly every mold of traditional philanthropy. She moves quickly, sidestepping the bureaucracy of legacy foundations. Instead of building a large institution, she works through a donor-advised fund and a lean, data-driven team.\n\nHer donations are also enormous in scale. In one round in 2021, she gave away about $2.74 billion to 286 organizations, which is more than many foundations distribute over a decade. Most importantly, her trust-based approach allows nonprofits to invest in long-term planning, infrastructure, and community-led solutions. Research shows this kind of unrestricted funding improves organizational resilience and multiplies impact.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:36.335510+00:00"}

There are official distinctions, like S&P 500 components versus those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but there are also more nuanced groupings, like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, etc.\n\nSometimes, investors will get a little whimsical and come up with catchy names to describe red-hot, winning stocks. The \"Nifty Fifty\" was a popular term for large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nJim Cramer used \"FANG\" to describe Facebook (now Meta Platforms (META 3.16%)), Amazon (AMZN 0.08%), Netflix (NFLX 0.55%), and Google (now Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%)). It eventually expanded to \"FAANG\" to include Apple (AAPL 1.13%).\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the largest seven technology-focused companies: Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (TSLA 0.54%).\n\nBut the Magnificent Seven has its problems, which is why I'm introducing the \"Ten Titans\" -- the Magnificent Seven plus Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), Oracle (ORCL 0.27%), and Netflix.\n\nHere's why the Ten Titans is a better representation of top growth stocks than the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe Broadcom blunder\n\nThe biggest flaw of the Magnificent Seven is that it doesn't include Broadcom. It's up about 450% in the last three years, which has pole-vaulted its market cap well over $1 trillion.\n\nBased on market cap, it deserves to be included in the Magnificent Seven over Tesla. However, some folks may prefer the diversification that Tesla brings to the table with electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). And some may argue that it's redundant to include both Nvidia and Broadcom since they're both chip giants, but Broadcom has a much different business than Nvidia.\n\nNvidia generates the vast majority of its profits by selling graphics processing units and associated hardware and software to data centers. Like Nvidia, Broadcom makes AI chips, and AI is its fastest-growing segment, making up around 30% of total revenue in its latest quarter. But the bulk of Broadcom's business is not directly tied to AI.\n\nEnd markets include networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, infrastructure software, and more. In fact, Broadcom was considered a dividend-paying value stock before its recent boom -- similar to another high-yield semiconductor stalwart, Texas Instruments.\n\nAnother \"value\" stock turned growth stock\n\nNot long ago, Oracle was seen more as a mature tech stock with an entrenched legacy business and limited upside potential. Investors were more excited about hotter software stocks like Salesforce, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Palo Alto Networks. However, Oracle has completely transformed its business, integrating cloud infrastructure as a complement to its foothold in database software and enterprise applications.\n\nOracle has carved out a growing role in the cloud that is uniquely different from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle's hybrid and multicloud strategy integrates with the major cloud players, which allows customers to use Oracle's database advantages even if they're with another cloud provider.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers some advantages over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, including lower prices in some cases, more AI tools, and vertical integration with the company's other database services.\n\nSome drawbacks of OCI are that it has a smaller ecosystem with fewer preset tools for developers. However, Oracle is growing faster than the major players with a 27% year-over-year cloud revenue increase in its most recent quarter, including a 52% rise in cloud infrastructure revenue.\n\nLike Broadcom, Oracle is a great addition to the Ten Titans because it's a highly diversified company that's playing a growing role in AI.\n\nFAANG's anchor is a worthy addition to the Ten Titans\n\nNetflix was an integral part of FANG and FAANG, but it fell out of favor for a while as it underperformed the broad market. The streaming company is now worth around half a trillion dollars, which has catapulted it to the top 20 S&P 500 companies by market cap.\n\nNetflix has pulled back from its recent highs, but the stock has still crushed the S&P 500 year to date. A big reason for its rebound in recent years is its improved cost management and more purposeful spending.\n\nA major problem with the business in the past was the boom-and-bust nature of its earnings. The company would steadily grow subscribers, but it would overspend on content and have dry spells without major success.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix spent most of the 2010s being inconsistently profitable. But over the last five years, profits have skyrocketed and its operating margin continues to climb in lockstep with revenue.\n\nThe company has revolutionized entertainment and remains the gold standard in streaming, despite tons of new competition. A lot of that success comes down to its ability to balance the quantity and quality of content it produces.\n\nIt's time to add some all-stars to the team\n\nExpanding the Magnificent Seven to the Ten Titans corrects for the blatant error of Broadcom's omission and includes massively important growth stocks in Oracle and Netflix. Over the next three to five years, it wouldn't be surprising if all of the Titans were worth over $1 trillion due to their industry leadership and runways for growth.\n\nWith a combined weighting of 37.7% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans offer investors a useful way to track the top growth stocks that can really move the major indexes and keep tabs on prevailing themes that are driving the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:38.278304+00:00"}

On July 31, Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) reported earnings for the second quarter (ended June 30).\n\nRevenue of $167.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.68 both came in well ahead of consensus analyst estimates. However, it's important to view this fresh information in the context of Amazon's bigger picture.\n\nHere's what this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock's latest earnings report means for long-term investors.\n\nSecond-quarter highlights\n\nI think it's appropriate to first give a brief high-level overview of the latest quarter's most important financial drivers. Revenue increased 13% year over year. The top line was bolstered by an 11% gain in the key North America segment.\n\nOperating income soared 31% to $19.2 billion in the quarter. CEO Andy Jassy has focused relentlessly on cost controls and operational efficiencies in recent years, so it's very encouraging to see this strategy play out in the form of rising profits.\n\nHowever, the stock tanked immediately following the news. The market is a forward-looking machine. And investors were not happy with management's forecast for operating income in the third quarter to be $18 billion at the midpoint. This would translate to just a 3% year-over-year gain, much slower than the recent growth Amazon has put up.\n\nZoom out and focus on the big picture\n\nEvery company's quarterly results are scrutinized by the investment community, but it's important to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Amazon's latest financial update provided some key insights for long-term investors.\n\nThe first takeaway is that the leadership team is intensely focused on the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. This is evident by looking at its surge in spending. Capital expenditures totaled $31.4 billion in the quarter.\n\nIf this pace continues, it translates to more than $125 billion on an annualized basis. These are huge moves meant to expand the company's technical infrastructure and better serve demand for AI.\n\nAnother takeaway is that Amazon is a well-rounded enterprise, which should make it the envy of other companies. Yes, this business is known first and foremost for how it totally disrupted the retail sector. Consequently, e-commerce remains key to its success.\n\nHowever, the company is in a position to keep benefiting from other powerful secular trends. Cloud computing is one area to watch. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has long been the leader in cloud computing. But its dominant position is being challenged, as rivals exhibit faster growth.\n\nThat's not too surprising because AWS is operating from a much bigger revenue base. The overall industry is rapidly expanding, which means there will be plenty of opportunities for multiple players to be successful. Nonetheless, investors will want to keep a close eye on this segment's sales growth.\n\nDigital advertising has become a very important piece of the Amazon pie. The business owns valuable digital real estate with its online marketplace and the Prime Video streaming service, which allows it to show ads. This segment grew revenue by 23%. And judging by the profitability of the top digital ad companies out there, Amazon is surely raking in meaningful earnings here.\n\nLong-term investors can also take solace in the fact that this stock remains a smart holding. As of Aug. 6, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33.9, significantly below the trailing-five-year average. And it shows that the stock's valuation is not even close to being stretched. There is still upside for patient investors who can look out five years or more.\n\nDespite the market's negative reaction to Amazon's second-quarter results, it's easy to see that this is still an elite business that deserves a place in your portfolio.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:39.767887+00:00"}

They’ve done smaller deals, but this week they caught the biggest fish yet: a $29 billion financing package for Meta Platforms Inc.’s massive data center in Louisiana.\n\nThat transaction, led by Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc., hits all the high notes: It’s a top-notch business in a hot sector. It disrupts the usual route that companies like Meta travel to get money from investors through banks. And, it’s huge.\n\n“Private credit has been itching to get into this space,” said John Medina, senior vice president on the global project and infrastructure finance team at Moody’s Ratings. “This deal is one of the first of its kind for private credit and if it is successful, we would expect to see more.”\n\nThe biggest technology companies are in an AI arms race now, and they need cash to win. Elon Musk’s xAI Corp. recently told investors it plans to spend $18 billion on data centers, and is looking at raising debt backed by projects rather than at the corporate level. Others including Amazon.com Inc. and OpenAI Inc. are pursuing their own sites across the US. Morgan Stanley estimates that capital expenditures on AI could exceed $3 trillion in the next three years.\n\nFor Meta, Pimco is leading $26 billion in debt and Blue Owl is providing $3 billion in equity. The debt portion is likely to be issued in the form of investment-grade bonds backed by the data center’s assets, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the final structure is still in flux. Morgan Stanley is advising Meta on the deal and arranging the financing.\n\nThe bidding war for the financing lasted months. It was competitive because private credit firms have been all-but-begging for access to the investment-grade debt world that banks dominate. Other private credit firms that grappled for the top spot include Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co., which made it to the final round, as well as Brookfield Asset Management Ltd., Blackstone Inc. and Ares Management Corp., said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:43.351877+00:00"}

Apple has also opened a manufacturing academy in Detroit, administered by Michigan State University, to train U.S. workers in AI and smart manufacturing.\n\nMagnifying Apple's appeasement and political diplomacy, Tim Cook presented a custom-made glass sculpture engraved with President Trump’s name and mounted on a 24-karat gold base. Most importantly to investors, the gesture was symbolic and strategic, as it coincided with Trump’s announcement that Apple would be exempt from the 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors.\n\nAAPL is Gaining Momentum\n\nAttributed to the tariff exemptions, Apple stock has now spiked +10% in August, with these month-to-date gains leading its “Magnificent Seven” big tech peers.\n\nHowever, AAPL is still toward the bottom of the group for the year, down 9% to only top Tesla’s TSLA -18%, with Nvidia NVDA up more than +30% and leading the pack.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAAPL Valuation Comparison\n\nIn terms of valuation, Apple currently checks in with the third cheapest P/E ratio among the Mag 7 at 30.5X forward earnings, only trailing Alphabet’s GOOGL 19.7X and Meta Platforms META 27.2X.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple also has the third-lowest P/S ratio among these big tech peers at 8.1X forward sales, trailing Amazon’s AMZN 3.3X and Alphabet’s 6.4X.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:54:45.193453+00:00"}

September guidance met expectations amid rising competition with Amazon.com (AMZN).\n\nThe company reported June quarter earnings after the market close on Thursday. On the stock market today, Trade Desk stock tumbled 38.6% to close at 54.23.\n\nRising Amazon Competition\n\nIn Q2, Trade Desk earnings rose 5% to 41 cents a share from a year earlier, the company said. Revenue climbed 19% to $694 million.\n\nTrade Desk stock analysts expected earnings of 41 cents a share on sales of $685 million, according to FactSet.\n\n\"The Amazon shadow over this stock is now front and center and harder to deny,\" said Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson in a report. \"Amazon needed more time to scale their demand side platform. Yet with their new deal with Roku (ROKU) coming on later this year, the debut of new NBA programming on Amazon Prime Video, the fallout from Omnicom's merger with IPG to create a much more lethal buying footprint with a likely heavier emphasis on Amazon's DSP, it seems inevitable that Amazon's momentum will become more apparent even to TTD's diehard bulls.\"\n\nAmazon's demand side platform lets advertisers buy display, video, and audio ads both on Amazon-owned properties and across the internet.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein maintained an out-perform rating on Trade Desk stock. Various issues impacted Q2 results, he said in a report.\n\nBofA Downgrades Trade Desk Stock\n\n\"Management blames tariff uncertainty, slower pace of next-gen adtech adoption by some large advertisers, and lack of excess ad budget on macro uncertainty,\" Helfstein said. \"The Amazon DSP bear thesis will remain an overhang, despite mostly self-inflicted issues from persistent senior management turnover.\"\n\nAt BMO Capital Markets, analyst Brian Pitz said management downplayed Amazon's impact on the Q2 earnings call with Wall Street analysts.\n\n\"TTD pushed back on bears believing Amazon is increasingly gaining open internet share, suggesting (Amazon's) owned inventory makes it impossible to objectively participate at scale,\" Pitz said in a report. \"(Trade Desk) CEO Jeff Green sees Amazon as a potential partner, suggesting Amazon may ultimately look to open up Prime Video demand externally to partners like TTD over time.\"\n\nBank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich downgraded Trade Desk stock to under-perform from buy.\n\n\"When Trade Desk reported Q4 2024 results, it raised concerns about competitive pressures, execution and whether it could sustain 20%-plus long-term growth to support its premium valuation,\" she said in a report. \"Bulls argued the miss stemmed from execution missteps and that a reset bar would restore TTD's beat and raise cadence. However, the company's Q3 outlook, which implies a deceleration in underlying growth, makes it harder to dismiss these concerns as a one-off event, especially against the backdrop of robust advertising growth being reported by many of the largest walled gardens.\"\n\nGuidance Underwhelms Investors\n\nThe Ventura, Calif.-based company said Q2 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 39% to $271 million. Analysts estimated EBITDA of $261 million.\n\nFor the September quarter, Trade Desk said it expects revenue of $717 million, roughly in-line with estimates of $716 million. It predicted EBITDA of $277 million, also in-line with estimates.\n\n\"The Trade Desk reported a solid quarter for revenue, but the beat was likely below investor expectations,\" said RBC Capital analyst Matthew Swanson in a report. \"Q3 guidance was more or less in line with consensus estimates for both adjusted EBITDA and revenue.\"\n\nIn addition, Trade Desk named a new chief financial officer, Alex Kayyal. He has been on Trade Desk's board and was most recently a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nHeading into the Trade Desk earnings report, TTD stock had retreated 25% in 2025. Shares plunged in February on weak guidance amid a company sales reorganization.\n\nTrade Desk Stock Technical Ratings\n\nThe company's automated platform enables brands and ad agencies to buy online and mobile ads in real time, rather than in advance manually. In addition, Trade Desk helps clients leverage online data to improve their targeted advertising.\n\nFurther, internet TV (also called connected TV) has been a growth driver for Trade Desk stock as more video streaming services become advertising supported.\n\nTrade Desk stock holds a Composite Rating of 83 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.\n\nMeanwhile, Trade Desk stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. (A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling.

AWS's robust position in cloud services suggests potential revenue and earnings growth, benefiting from industry shifts towards digital adoption. This aligns with analysts' expectations that AWS, through its technological advancements, could experience significant high-margin revenue growth.\n\nOver the past three years, Amazon's total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, was 55.44%. This performance showcases a trajectory of growth, positioning Amazon favorably against the tech industry.

The strategies driving these results are evident in Amazon's consistent emphasis on technological integration and international expansion, both critical for sustaining growth.\n\nDespite the recent legal and regulatory hurdles mentioned earlier, the synergy between AWS and AI could positively influence Amazon's revenue and earnings forecasts. Analysts project annual revenue growth of 10.5% over the next three years, with expectations that profit margins will expand, driven largely by AWS.

Exits were part of a broader simplification and refocus strategy,” said Dufay.\n\nThat dual focus on growth with discipline is a clear departure from the company’s earlier playbook. Between 2015 and 2021, Jumia entered 14 countries and launched several businesses, from food delivery to payments to logistics. The company IPO’d in New York in 2019, only to see its valuation plunge as losses mounted.\n\n“We’re working to reduce tech and G&A in absolute terms; we have a lot of optimizations that are going to pay off in the second half,” Dufay noted.\n\nJumia’s Q2 2025 earnings delivered on multiple fronts. Revenues climbed 15% year over year to $49.6 million, while gross merchandise value (GMV) posted its second consecutive quarterly increase, a sign that demand, particularly in core markets like Nigeria and Kenya, is recovering. Contribution margin improved 157% YoY, and cost discipline was evident across sales, marketing, and fulfillment lines.\n\n“What you’re seeing this quarter is really the compounded effect of two years of hard work to turn around the company,” Dufay said. “Two clean quarters together, and it shows this company is completely different from what it used to be two years back. It’s actually growing again on much better economics.”\n\nDufay, who took over the reins in late 2022, has made profitability the core mission of his tenure, a sharp break from the company’s earlier years of aggressive expansion and operational sprawl. The transformation is already visible: leaner cost structures, fewer countries, and a more deliberate push into high-efficiency logistics.\n\nYet Jumia’s CEO, Francis Dufay, isn’t taking a victory lap. “We’re not profitable yet, so we still have a lot of work to do… we try to keep a cool head, even on a good day,” he said in an exclusive interview with Investing.com.\n\nInvesting.com -- After years of bleeding cash and testing investor patience, Jumia Technologies AG (NYSE:JMIA), heralded as Africa’s Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), may have reached its \"turning point.\" Following second-quarter earnings that beat expectations and sent shares soaring as much as 30%, the continent’s largest e-commerce company is now signaling something it hasn’t in years: stability.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Macro Balancing Act\n\nCost cutting alone does not protect a company from Africa’s economic volatility. The past few years have been punishing: Nigeria’s naira had lost up to 80% of its value, Ghana saw 50% inflation, and Egypt’s pound depreciated by more than 40%.\n\n“The past three years have been more of a hurricane than headwinds,” Dufay reflected. “Currency stability will massively stabilize our supply and will not hurt our customers’ purchasing power for once.”\n\nStill, Jumia has managed to find momentum even amid the chaos. “We’re growing in Nigeria 36% in GMV, which hasn’t happened in years, even with Temu in the market,” Dufay said. “We’re by far the market leader in Nigeria, and we’re consolidating that position on sound economics.”\n\nEgypt, too, has shown signs of life after a rough start to the year. “We’ve massively improved our assortment. We’ve also introduced new payment methods to offer more flexibility, including buy now pay later with installments… we’re very confident that Egypt can very soon contribute positively to the growth of the company,” said Dufay.\n\nJumia has also taken a defensive stance on treasury management. “We keep most of our cash in U.S. dollars,” Dufay said. That approach has helped the company shield itself from severe FX losses. and even gain an advantage when suppliers and partners struggle with local currency volatility.\n\nStaying Grounded Amid Axian Rumors\n\nJumia’s market outreach and financial woes have caught the attention of investors and potential buyers. Earlier in Q2, Axian Group, a pan-African telecom and infrastructure giant, disclosed an 8% stake in Jumia, upped it past 9%, and raised $600 million in a bond offering, fueling acquisition speculation.\n\nWhile Dufay declined to address the M&A chatter directly, he made it clear that profitability remains the primary focus. \"It’s understood on both sides, we’re not expecting a strategic U-turn. We’re on a mission to be profitable in ’27 and for all investors.\"\n\nThat does not mean talks are not happening. “Since they disclosed their position, we’ve been talking… looking at what we can achieve together, where we can create synergies,” he added, pointing to business in Senegal as a potential partnership opportunity.\n\nFinding the Right Channels\n\nOne advantage Jumia has is its flexible approach to customer engagement. From in‑app orders to WhatsApp to call‑ins and third‑party agents, the company has adapted to how Africans actually shop, especially in rural, low-income areas.\n\n“I think what we learned about our customers over the past many years is that almost a lot of them are channel agnostic... So we have also ourselves turned into a more channel agnostic company,” said Dufay. \"It’s totally fine if you just want to call us and place an order. It’s totally fine if you want to order on WhatsApp, and it’s fine if you want to download the app and order on the app.\"\n\nHe points to JForce, Jumia’s network of independent sales agents, as a particularly powerful channel in hard‑to‑reach regions.\n\n“JForce is a very relevant channel to enter up‑country markets that many thought would never work for e‑commerce,” he said. “It’s great because it also enables local entrepreneurs to grow their business. It clicked really well.”\n\nWhen asked if Jumia and JForce’s marketing outreach, using traditional paper-and-pen methods, undermines goals to digitize e‑commerce, Dufay made the distinction very clear: “First of all, my mission is to make this company profitable. I don’t know if we’re going to digitize Africa; that’s not really the point.”\n\nThe Next Chapter: Cautious Optimism\n\nJumia may still be in the red, but it is closer than ever to achieving what once seemed impossible: a sustainable, profitable African e‑commerce platform.\n\n“We need further acceleration in usage and further cost savings, and we need further cost savings to materialize,” Dufay said. “July is already looking pretty good, and that’s why we raised the guidance.”\n\nThe work, he knows, is not over.\n\n“Nobody can pay for waste. We serve cost‑conscious customers, so we have to be extra lean,” he said. “The best way to be ready for shocks is to be very affordable on the assortment side and very lean on the cost side.”\n\nFor investors long wary of Jumia’s risk, this quarter may finally be proving something more valuable: resilience.\n\nRelated articles\n\nExclusive: Jumia CEO Dufay on strong Q2, macro ’hurricanes’, and Axian rumors\n\nClients buying into summer rally, bracing for later pullback, says BofA's Hartnett\n\nThese Under-the-Radar Stocks Offer Better Risk-Reward Ratio Than Nvidia", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:55:14.247322+00:00"}

The outperformance can be attributed to Alphabet’s strong second-quarter 2025 results that revealed the benefits of AI infusion across its Search business and a surge in Google Cloud revenues.\n\n\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Google Search and other revenues increased 11.7% year over year to $54.19 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.04% and accounting for 56.2% of total revenues. Overall queries and commercial queries on Search continued to grow year over year in the reported quarter.\n\n\n\nGoogle continues to dominate the Search business, handling over 5 trillion queries annually, per Semrush. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. Google accounts for 89.66% market share, followed by Microsoft’s MSFT Bing, with 3.88% share.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues surged 31.7% year over year to $13.62 billion and accounted for 14.1% of the quarter’s total revenues. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.24%. The year-over-year growth was driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core GCP products, AI Infrastructure, and Generative AI Solutions. Google Cloud’s annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion.\n\n\n\nThe strong growth in Search and Google Cloud has helped Alphabet shares outperform its closest peers in the cloud computing domain, Microsoft and Amazon. According to Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s AMZN cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, continues to lead with a 30% market share in the second quarter of 2025, while Alphabet and Microsoft had 20% and 13% market share, respectively.\n\nGOOGL Stock’s Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Push to Boost GOOGL’s Prospects\n\nAlphabet is advancing visual and contextual search capabilities. The Circle to Search feature is now active on more than 300 million devices. The company is adding functionalities to help people explore complex topics and ask follow-up questions without switching apps. For instance, gamers can now use Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI Overview or answers.\n\n\n\nAI Overviews now reach more than 2 billion users per month and are available in over 200 countries across 40 languages. It is now driving over 10% more queries globally. Powered by Gemini 2.5, AI Overviews currently delivers the fastest AI responses in the industry. The combination of lens or Circle to Search, together with AI Overviews, is driving multimodal search usage.\n\n\n\nGoogle’s AI-powered Search features are driving deeper engagement, with AI Mode offering advanced reasoning and multimodal responses. Users are generating queries twice as long as those in traditional searches. The launch of AI Mode in the United States and India — where it currently has more than 100 million monthly active users — is expected to drive further growth.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud is benefiting from its partnership with the likes of NVIDIA and PayPal PYPL. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. PayPal will expand its Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven recommendations, transaction processing and enhanced security. The partnership expands the availability and functionality of PayPal’s payment services and capabilities across a range of Google products.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud’s expanding clientele is expected to boost Alphabet’s top line. In the second quarter of 2025, the number of deals was over $250 million, doubling year over year, and the number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 28% sequentially.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:55:16.067785+00:00"}

Despite this strength, investors reacted negatively as the stock tumbled more than 7% in after-hours trading, reflecting concerns about forward guidance and operational efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe disappointment centered on Amazon's third-quarter operating income guidance of $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion compared with $17.4 billion in the third quarter of 2024. This wide guidance range signals uncertainty in management's outlook and raises questions about profit margin sustainability amid intensifying competition and substantial artificial intelligence investments.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 net sales is pegged at $706.45 billion, indicating growth of 10.74% from the prior-year reported figure.

Quote\n\nAWS Growth Deceleration Raises Strategic Questions\n\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) experienced challenges in the quarter, with operating margins declining from 39.5% in the first quarter to 32.9% in the recent results. Management attributed roughly half this sequential drop to seasonal stock-based compensation, while the remainder stemmed from rising depreciation tied to AI infrastructure investments and foreign exchange headwinds. AWS grew 17% year over year to $30.9 billion, beating the consensus mark by 0.71% but representing deceleration from previous quarters. This growth rate also trails Microsoft MSFT Azure's 39% and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud's 32% expansion in the same period.\n\n\n\nThe AWS backlog was pinned at $195 billion, up 25% year over year, signaling healthy forward demand, though constrained supply — especially power — continues to limit revenue realization. Demand continues to outstrip capacity, and resolution may take several quarters. This supply-demand imbalance highlights both AWS' market strength and its current infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly as hyperscaler competitors intensify their artificial intelligence offerings.\n\n\n\nThe retail segments delivered solid performance, with online store sales reaching $61.5 billion, up 11% year over year.

Cook met with Trump a number of times throughout his first term in office and made investment commitments in the US that helped spare Apple from the worst of Trump’s levies.\n\nIn 2017, Apple announced its Advanced Manufacturing Fund aimed at investing $1 billion in US companies, including $200 million for Corning’s Harrodsburg, Ky., plant. That’s the same facility Apple committed $2.5 billion to during its press event Wednesday.\n\nIn January 2018, as Trump threatened a trade war, Apple again came forward with a plan to invest in the US. This time, the company said it would contribute $350 billion to the economy via new investments and spending at domestic suppliers and manufacturers. The move coincided with Apple repatriating some $250 billion under a tax bill at the time.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:55:31.668266+00:00"}

The Dow has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the addition of growth stocks such as Salesforce in 2020 and Amazon and Nvidia in 2024. However, the index remains a great starting point for finding top dividend stocks.\n\nHere's why these Fool.com contributors think Honeywell International (HON 0.28%) of the industrial sector, financial sector representative American Express (AXP 2.30%), and consumer staples stalwart Coca-Cola (KO -0.02%) are three great dividend stocks to buy now, even though they are hovering around all-time highs.\n\nHoneywell's breakup will create value for investors\n\nLee Samaha (Honeywell): Despite the recent sell-off of the industrial stock, it remains close to its all-time high price.\n\nThe investment case for this Dow Jones member currently revolves around its impending breakup and the amount of value that can be released in its constituent parts as they trade as stand-alone companies.\n\nIt's a breakup with an understandable rationale. For example, aerospace companies (Honeywell Aerospace will be the largest of the three new companies) are traditionally valued differently from industrial companies to reflect the long-cycle nature of their business.\n\nHoneywell Automation (set to be the remaining company) combines building automation and industrial automation, and its separation is part of a trend of industrial companies becoming more focused as automation becomes more software-driven by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalization technologies. It's a trend followed by peers like Emerson Electric, Siemens, and Johnson Controls.\n\nFinally, the advanced materials business (Solstice Advanced Materials) will offer investors an opportunity to invest in a pure-play sustainable materials business.\n\nAs you can see from this short description, they are significantly different businesses. When separated into three more focused and agile companies with their own capital raising dynamics and sets of investors behind them, they will have an opportunity to release value for investors.\n\nAmerican Express remains a good value for long-term investors\n\nDaniel Foelber (American Express): The financial services company is knocking on the door of an all-time high for all the right reasons. American Express continues to deliver excellent results despite pressures on consumer spending by catering to affluent customers.\n\nAmerican Express charges relatively high fees for its top credit cards, but it makes those fees worth it by offering cardholders attractive perks -- such as high baseline cash back rates and a variety of reward redemption options.\n\nUnlike Visa and Mastercard, American Express is both a payment processor and a card issuer. Its revenue stream is diverse, consisting of card fees, as well as transaction fees related to card usage frequency and volume.\n\nIt's a near-perfect business model -- as long as American Express customers pay off their loans. In its latest quarter (second quarter of 2025), American Express reported a 2% net write-off rate. It defines net write-off as a principal loss from a consumer or small business card member, net of what American Express was able to recover (interest not included). Net write-offs are also known as net charge-offs.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, net charge-off rates on credit card banks at all commercial banks for the first quarter of 2025 were 4.44%. This means that American Express does an exceptional job of managing risk and limiting steep losses from customers not paying their loans.\n\nAmerican Express is similar to an insurance company that has a track record of above-average underwriting -- like those owned by Berkshire Hathaway (American Express also happens to be one of Berkshire's largest holdings). In other words, the risk American Express is taking is of high quality relative to the industry -- which makes investing in the company more appealing.\n\nOver the last three years, American Express stock has soared 130.3% compared to 43.2% diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth. So the stock isn't as cheap as it used to be -- with a 21.8 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 17.2 10-year median P/E. However, American Express is arguably worth the premium price due to the strength of its underlying business model and clear path toward future earnings growth.\n\nPut some pop in your passive income stream with Coca-Cola\n\nScott Levine (Coca-Cola): Although shares of Coca-Cola have trended lower over the past few weeks, it was only a few months ago that shares had been their most effervescent.\n\nOn April 22, Coca-Cola stock bubbled up to uncharted territory when it climbed to an intraday high of $74.38 and ultimately closed at $73.90. Since then, shares have retreated from that level, falling about 6% as of this writing. Nonetheless, shares are hardly sporting a frothy valuation, and investors looking to quench their thirst for passive income would be wise to consider Coca-Cola stock along with its forward-yielding 2.9% dividend.\n\nThose who only know Coca-Cola for the legendary namesake soft drink may be surprised to learn that the company has consistently acquired a variety of brands over the years. From its acquisition of Minute Maid, a popular juice brand, to gaining a well-known iced tea brand with the acquisition of Honest Tea, to picking up a recognizable milk name in its acquisition of Fairlife, Coca-Cola has diversified its portfolio considerably over the decades. As lifestyle trends shift toward consumers adopting healthier habits, Coca-Cola is well-positioned to prosper from its robust portfolio of consumer beverage brands.\n\nIn addition to owning the title of the world's largest beverage company, Coca-Cola wears the crown of Dividend King, having consistently hiked its distribution for 63 consecutive years. While it's not a guarantee that the company will rack up another six decades of dividend hikes, it's certainly an auspicious sign that management is committed to rewarding shareholders.\n\nA cursory glance at Coca-Cola's valuation suggests that today's not a great time to click the buy button. Shares are trading a 21.7 times operating cash flow. Dig a little deeper, however, and investors will find that the valuation is actually a discount to the stock's five-year average cash flow multiple of 22.6. As an industry leader with a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders, Coca-Cola stock is a great option now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:55:34.238080+00:00"}

While the market remains volatile, there are still stocks that have great long-term runways.\n\nLet's look at three consumer growth stocks you can buy and hold for the long term.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) continues to make its massive e-commerce engine more efficient. The company just keeps getting better with its warehouses and logistics. It's now using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize warehouse placement, route planning, and inventory management, which is improving delivery speeds and lowering costs. At the same time, it now has more than a million robots in operation, helping move products faster and more efficiently.\n\nThat showed up clearly last quarter when its North America operating income jumped 47% to $7.5 billion on only an 11% increase in revenue. International results were strong too, with segment profit hitting $1.5 billion. That was a huge improvement from just $300 million a year earlier. It's also seeing strong growth from higher-margin areas like advertising, where revenue surged 23%.\n\nWhile its stock dipped following its Q2 results, the core Amazon story hasn't changed. In addition to its e-commerce business becoming more efficient, the company is still the market leader in cloud computing through AWS, which pulled in more than $10 billion in operating income on 17.5% revenue growth. AWS remains a critical platform for developers and enterprises looking to build and run AI models and apps. Amazon continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, and while that will weigh a bit on near-term margins, it's setting the company up for strong returns over time.\n\nLong term, Amazon remains one of the best growth stories in the market.\n\n2. E.l.f. Beauty\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF 4.51%) is looking to quickly return to growth mode. The company has dominated the mass cosmetics category for the past few years, but after a surprise slowdown in sales, it made a bold move to enter the prestige skincare and cosmetics market through its $1 billion acquisition of Rhode.\n\nThe acquisition brings with it a premium skincare line, higher average selling prices, and a strong brand built around Hailey Bieber. She's staying on as chief creative officer, helping guide future product development. Bieber herself also carries a lot of marketing might, and e.l.f. will plug Rhode into its strong influencer network as well.\n\nThe even bigger opportunity for e.l.f. is increasing Rhode's distribution. The brand already had impressive traction with more than $200 million in annual sales offering just 10 or so products through its website. However, that's about to change, with the brand debuting at Sephora this fall, and e.l.f. likely to use its strong retail connections to expand the brand's presence.\n\nThat said, this isn't just about one brand -- it's about building a beauty platform with a longer runway. Rhode complements e.l.f.'s core mass-market business and opens up more premium price points. The company also has whitespace internationally, and could expand into adjacent categories like fragrance over time.\n\nAfter a brief slowdown in the fourth quarter, this deal gives e.l.f. another engine for growth. Its track record speaks for itself, as the company has already completely upended the mass cosmetics market. That makes it a stock worth holding for the long term.\n\n3. Cava\n\nCava Group (CAVA 3.40%) is hitting its stride and has one of the largest potential expansion opportunities in the restaurant space. The fast-casual chain has now delivered four straight quarters of double-digit same-store sales gains, including a 10.8% increase last quarter. Just as important, traffic is growing quickly, up 7.5% in fiscal Q1.\n\nCava's menu continues to evolve, which is helping attract new customers and keep its loyal customers coming back. Its introduction of grilled steak was a game-changer, helping drive higher check sizes, while premium add-ons like juices and pita chips are also increasing sales. Cava is also experimenting with new dishes and a loyalty program to improve frequency and retention.\n\nThe Cava story is still early, but it's very reminiscent of a young Chipotle Mexican Grill, with a similar fresh, fast, customizable, and healthy food vibe. Offering minimal ingredients, just like Chipotle, also creates restaurant efficiencies, such as speeding up customer wait times and eliminating food waste. This leads to a high restaurant-level margin.\n\nThat said, the real story is still unit growth. Cava ended last quarter with 382 locations and plans to open 64 to 68 new restaurants this year. That's high-teens unit growth. Its long-term goal is 1,000 locations by 2032. The company has been smart with where it expands, starting along the coasts, and now moving into bigger Midwest cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Indianapolis. Its strategy is working, and the brand is now resonating across regions.\n\nTaken altogether, Cava looks like a stock to own for the long haul.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:55:35.773528+00:00"}

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Snap SNAP.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMETA’s new AI-powered recommendation model for ads drove roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. A meaningful percentage of ad revenues came from campaigns that used one of its Generative AI (Gen AI) features. Smaller advertisers with limited budgets are expected to benefit from these Gen AI features. Enhanced capabilities of Andromeda that powers the ads retrieval stage of META’s ads system have driven nearly 4% higher conversions on Facebook mobile Feed and Reels.\n\nAI push is helping Meta Platforms’ offer content that is interesting and useful, eventually driving engagement. Improvement in content quality driven by META’s recommendation system has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram in the recently concluded second-quarter 2025. The launch of AI video editing tools across Meta AI and the new Edits app are noteworthy developments.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, video engagement improved with Instagram video time jumping more than 20% year-over-year globally. Video time spent on Facebook surged more than 20% year over year. Meta Platforms’ focus on further increasing the freshness of original posts is expected to drive user engagement.\n\nHere’s Why You Should Hold META Stock Right Now\n\nMeta Platforms is spending heavily on expanding AI infrastructure. For 2025, capital expenditure is expected to be between $66 billion and $72 billion (up from $64-$72 billion), driven by META’s Gen AI initiatives and core business.\n\nOperating expenses are expected in the $114-$118 billion range, with headcount expected to increase within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, Gen AI, regulations and compliance. Regulatory concerns in the United States and Europe, along with tariffs and premium valuation, make the stock a risky bet.\n\nAlthough these investments bode well for the company’s longer-term prospects, we believe sluggish monetization of platforms, such as Threads and Meta AI, is a concern. WhatsApp ads in Status are likely to earn a lower average price than Facebook or Instagram ads for the foreseeable future. Meta Platforms does not expect ads in Status to be a meaningful contributor to total impressions or revenue growth for the next few years. Ad revenues are expected to suffer from uncertainty related to higher tariffs and challenging macroeconomic conditions.\n\nMETA currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies that investors should wait for a more favorable point to accumulate the stock.

Although he will step down as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO, Buffett will continue to serve as chairman of the board. I suspect he'll talk with incoming CEO Greg Abel regularly.\n\nWhile Buffett has been a net seller of stocks for 11 consecutive quarters, he's not entirely on the sidelines on that front either. The \"Oracle of Omaha\" might not be buying many stocks these days, but he's still buying a few. I think some of the legendary investor's previous picks look quite attractive. Here are three no-brainer Buffett stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nEvery pullback in Amazon's (AMZN 0.08%) share price in the past presented a great buying opportunity. I have no reason to doubt that the latest one will be any different.\n\nSure, some Wall Street analysts are concerned that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a laggard in the artificial intelligence (AI) race after the cloud unit underperformed compared with its rivals. But AWS remains the leader in the cloud services market. Importantly, it's also growing robustly, with sales jumping 17.5% year over year in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nSome investors could also be worried about how tariffs could hurt Amazon's e-commerce business. CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged in the Q2 earnings call that there's uncertainty related to tariffs. However, he said that the company hasn't seen demand declining or prices increase by a significant level so far. Jassy believes that customers will continue to shop on Amazon's platform because they're able to find the products they want at lower prices.\n\nI fully expect AWS will continue to claim the highest market share in the cloud market and enjoy a strong AI tailwind. I predict that Amazon will successfully navigate the challenges created by the Trump administration's trade policies. And I look for the company to keep finding new ways to grow.\n\n2. Domino's Pizza\n\nDomino's Pizza (DPZ 0.22%) is one of the handful of stocks that Buffett, or one of his investment managers, has bought in recent quarters. Berkshire Hathaway now owns 7.7% of the pizza giant.\n\nWhy is Domino's Pizza a great pick for other investors right now? I think the stock could prove to be highly resilient if the economy weakens. With inflation rising and a lackluster recent jobs report, the odds of an economic pullback appear to be increasing.\n\nWhen times are tough, many consumers curtail spending on going out to eat. However, ordering pizza is a relatively cheap substitute. Domino's frequent deals could entice even cost-conscious consumers to splurge a little in a way that doesn't bust their budgets.\n\nAlso, tariffs shouldn't be a huge issue for Domino's Pizza. The company relies on domestic suppliers for its ingredients. Even if some of those ingredient prices rise, I think customers will still find Domino's an attractive option that's less expensive than most alternatives.\n\n3. Mitsubishi\n\nBuffett thinks so highly of Mitsubishi (MSBHF 1.63%) that he has included the Japanese stock on the list that he expects Berkshire to own \"indefinitely.\" He also likes the company's business model, which he has likendd to Berkshire's own business.\n\nWith Berkshire's shares trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.7, Buffett hasn't authorized any stock buybacks this year. But Mitsubishi looks like a bargain with a forward earnings multiple of 14. I view this stock as kind of a cheaper version of Berkshire with a Japanese accent.\n\nMitsubishi's attractive valuation isn't the result of a steep decline, by the way. The stock has soared more than 20% year to date.\n\nInvesting in Mitsubishi is almost like investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) because of the diversification it offers -- again, similar to Berkshire. The conglomerate owns 1,205 companies that operate in a wide range of industries, including energy, food, materials, and more.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:55:39.747632+00:00"}

From pioneering advanced data center cooling to heat management for modern and next-gen engines, we deliver innovative, differentiated solutions. Another Strong Beat-and-Raise Quarter On July 30, Modine delivered earnings per share (EPS) of $1.06, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.93 per share by 14%. This was their Q1 for fiscal year 2026 which ends in March. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times, including +18% and +16% positive surprises for the previous two quarters. Modine posted revenues of $682.8 million for the quarter ended June 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.87%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $661.5 million. The company has also topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. And the key icing on the thermal cake was this headline on the earnings press release... \"Raising guidance for fiscal 2026 based on improved outlook for data center sales resulting from planned capacity expansion coupled with impact from recent acquisitions.\"\n\nChicago, IL – August 8, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Modine Manufacturing MOD as the Bull of the Day and Align Technology ALGN as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN .\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrecision-Engineered Cool\n\nBecause of their thermal expertise and consistent execution track-record, Modine is now expecting data center sales to grow in excess of 45% this year.\n\n\n\nMy colleague Tracey Ryniec recognized their potential two years ago when she bought MOD shares at $47 for her Value Investor portfolio. She attended the Modine conference call on July 31 and here were some of her live posts on X...\n\n\n\n@TraceyRyniec: Modine is working with a \"very important customer\" to develop a product that will get that customer to the market faster in data centers. Cuts the time down to just a few months. Will make it in Calgary.\n\n\n\n@TraceyRyniec: Continue to win new programs in data centers. It started out slow in Q1 at 15%. But some customers have asked to increase volumes or accelerate volumes. Needed the capacity to support it and to meet the order book for next year. Acceleration in 2H.\n\n\n\n@TraceyRyniec: One large order in the DC area of $180 million. Is there other business of this magnitude out there? A: Yes, this is what drove the $100 million in spending. Expects orders of this kind of magnitude.\n\n\n\n@TraceyRyniec: Loves the growth in data center but will be actively growing the funnel in HVAC technologies. Believes in being diversified in all its businesses.\n\n\n\n@TraceyRyniec: The analysts on the Modine CC sounded like a lot of people in 2023 when NVIDIA was posting crazy revenue growth. How can this be real? Is it sustainable? First half data center growth was 20-25% but second half expected to be 80%. Next phase of the AI Revolution hitting now.\n\n\n\nOn this last post, Tracey nails it. Investors and analysts are still underestimating the growth potential of the AI Economy. Recall that $600 billion capex for infrastructure I mentioned earlier. Conservative estimates from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America place that annual spend at over $1 trillion in 2028.\n\n\n\nAnd it doesn't stop there with the volume of autonomous machines, including self-driving cars and humanoid robots, that need to be supported by GPU-accelerated datacenters -- all of which need lots of cooling solutions.\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang estimates that humanoid robots will become the next multi-trillion-dollar industry. Just imagine when factory floors of robots are making other robots and machinery. Yep, more cooling.\n\nThe Environmental Mission\n\nIt's been trendy and slick to tag one's company as \"green\" and \"eco-friendly.\" But Modine isn't being either when they explain how their technologies can pragmatically serve this giant new industry in more sustainable ways.\n\n\n\nUnder the banner of being \"driven by our purpose of Engineering a Cleaner, Healthier World™\" the company cites 5 core outcomes they are achieving...\n\n\n\n>Reduce water and energy consumption\n\n>Improve indoor air quality\n\n>Use environmentally friendly refrigerants\n\n>Enable cleaner-running vehicles\n\n>Lower harmful emissions\n\n\n\nBottom line: Modine is in a prime position to benefit from the global AI infrastructure buildout. I will remain long shares of MOD looking for new highs above $150 soon. I don't think the gap back to $113 gets filled and investors should add to positions in the $120s.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nAlign Technology, maker of the clear \"smile straightener\" Invisalign, reported Q2 2025 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.49, up 3.3% from the year-ago level. But the profit figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%.\n\n\n\nGAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.72, reflecting a rise of 43.4% from $1.28 in the comparable period of 2024.\n\n\n\nThe top line also missed expectations by 4.6%, decreasing 1.6% year-over-year to $1.01 billion.\n\n\n\nFollowing the earnings announcement on July 30, ALGN shares imploded 36.6% the next day.\n\n\n\nYou can find more details on Align Segments and Margins in this article from July 31...\n\n\n\nALGN Stock Falls on Q2 Earnings and Revenue Miss, Margins Down\n\n\n\nBased on the company results, analysts have knocked down full-year EPS estimates from $10.33 to $10.10, representing 8.25% annual profit growth.\n\n\n\nAnd the 2025 topline estimate falls to $4 billion for roughly zero growth.\n\nStock Repurchase Plan and New Insider Moves\n\nDuring the reported quarter, the company repurchased approximately 585.1 thousand shares of common stock at an average price of $164.14 per share, completing the $225.0 million open market repurchase initiated in the first quarter of 2025. This marked the completion of the $1.0 billion stock repurchase program, approved in January 2023, in its entirety.\n\n\n\nIn April 2025, its board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of common stock, expected to be completed over a period of up to three years.\n\n\n\nBut both the company and the CEO took advantage of the stock drop to accumulate more shares.\n\n\n\nOn August 1, Align announced in a press release that President and CEO Joe Hogan stepped into the market and \"Personally Purchases $1 Million of Align's Common Stock.\"\n\n\n\nDetails of the transaction reveal that Hogan purchased 7,576 shares of Common Stock on August 1, 2025, at a price of $131.4851 per share, totaling $996,131. Following this transaction, Hogan directly owns 184,945 shares.\n\n\n\nThen on August 8, Align announced a $200 Million Open Market Repurchase of common stock.\n\nOur Take on ALGN\n\nI have been an investor in ALGN for many years because I thought very highly of two aspects of their business model:\n\n\n\n(1) Digital services that could economically and efficiently serve remote and poor communities at scale\n\n\n\n(2) Aggressive growth push into China and India where many tens of millions of kids need their services\n\n\n\nBut I have avoided the stock for several quarters now because of uncertainties. Now, with the current de-risking and a 2.5X price-to-sales multiple, I may be taking a closer look as we get more visibility about the growth model in the coming weeks and I dive into company presentation materials.\n\n\n\nUntil then, here is the Zacks Research summary...\n\n\n\nAlign Technology exited the second quarter of 2025 with weaker-than-expected results, wherein both earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, revenues deteriorated on a year-over-year basis due to a decline in the Clear Aligner segment’s sales. Contraction of both the gross and operating margins is a matter of concern.\n\n\n\nOn a positive note, Clear Aligner volume grew in APAC and EMEA regions, driven by increased utilization across both orthodontists and general practitioners (GP) dentist channels, with strength in the adult segment. Additionally, ALGN’s Imaging Systems & CAD/CAM Services business segment reported strong growth on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to iTero Lumina wand upgrades and increased services as more doctors transition to iTero Element 5D Plus.\n\n\n\nDuring the quarter, Align Technology achieved a record number of teen cases, with over 6 million teens and kids having been treated with the Invisalign system globally and over 20 million total cases.\n\n\n\nBottom line: The downward estimates revisions were not that bad, so a buying opportunity is close at hand. The Zacks Rank will let you know.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nPalantir Achieves $1B Revenues, Is It Too Late to Invest?\n\nDue to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), large tech companies like NVIDIA Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. have experienced substantial expansion, raising questions about their future growth.\n\nInstead, emerging companies like Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) are attracting more investor interest, especially after the company recently achieved record revenue growth and raised its forecast. However, with Palantir’s shares soaring 512% over the past year, is it too late to invest, or does it still offer a solid investment opportunity? Let’s explore—\n\nPalantir Reports Record Q2, Surpasses $1B Revenues\n\nPalantir's revenues hit $1 billion for the first time in the second quarter, rising 14% sequentially and 48% year over year. The company's earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter were $0.16, a 78% increase year over year. Both results beat Wall Street's estimates, which projected revenues of $939 million and an adjusted EPS of $0.14.\n\nRevenues were mainly driven by the U. S. commercial segment, with a steady flow of new customers attracted to Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Revenues from this segment reached $306 million, accounting for 31% of total revenues. This was a 20% increase from the previous quarter and a 93% rise year over year.\n\nPalantir's U. S. commercial customer count grew by 12% sequentially and 64% year over year. Furthermore, existing customers are spending more, as shown by Palantir's net dollar retention rate of 128%.\n\nPalantir Raises Full-Year Outlook, Confident of Future Growth\n\nThe company increased its full-year guidance, now expecting revenues between $4.142 billion and $4.150 billion, up from the previous forecast of $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion.\n\nFor the third quarter, Palantir projects revenues between $1.083 billion and $1.087 billion, surpassing Wall Street's estimate of $983 million. The company also upgraded its projections for operating income and cash flow for the entire year.\n\nAdditionally, Palantir's remaining performance obligation (RPO), or the revenues guaranteed by contracts but not yet recognized, jumped 77% to $2.42 billion in the second quarter. This indicates potential for future growth, and the outlook remains optimistic.\n\nPalantir's CEO, Alex Karp, expressed enthusiasm about the company's prospects, stating in the quarterly letter to shareholders that “this is still only the beginning of something much larger and, we believe, even more significant.”\n\nHow to Trade Palantir Stock Now\n\nPalantir's robust quarter, propelled by AI and optimistic growth outlooks, should reassure investors to hold onto their shares. Also, Palantir's steady defense contracts create significant barriers for new competitors, while an increase in commercial clients points to potential long-term expansion.\n\nHowever, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 308.1 compared to the Internet - Software industry's forward P/E of 43.56, Palantir's stock appears overvalued relative to its earnings. Therefore, new investors should wait for a price correction or decline before investing.\n\nFor now, Palantir has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, many leading tech companies have made it clear that they don't intend to scale back their spending.

That's in addition to the $6.2 billion the tech giant invested in New Albany between 2015-2024. Across the entire state, Amazon has invested more than $19.7 billion in data center infrastructure since 2015, the company reported.\n\nThe company has completed construction and staffing for two of five data centers and related buildings totaling 1.25 million square feet on 85 of 439 acres that the company bought along Beech and Miller roads in January 2023.\n\nRoger Wehner, vice president of economic development at Amazon Web Services, said New Albany is the heart of an emerging tech ecosystem that continues to grow and evolve. Wehner cited the clear vision of central Ohio leaders, Ohio's talent pool and utility partners such as AEP Ohio as to why the company continues to expand in Ohio.\n\n\"I would say that that growth is never a foregone conclusion. We continue to grow a lot of other places, too. What's been differentiated here is in a lot of different cases where challenges have arisen, both sides have rolled up their sleeves, problem solved, and that's one of the main reasons we continue to grow here,\" he said.\n\nAmazon, which already has 56 data centers planned or in operation in Ohio, continues to pour billions into the Buckeye State. In December 2024, the company announced it will invest $10 billion in Ohio data centers by 2030 — beyond the billions the company already announced.\n\nIn March, Marysville City Council approved an agreement with Amazon that will result in the company investing $1 billion there by 2030.\n\nAmazon touted its commitment to central Ohio by donating $200,000 to the 185,890-square-foot New Albany Parks and Recreation's fieldhouse and community center, underway at the northwest corner of Bevelhymer Road and Walnut Street. The company's donation will go toward a new Amazon Think Big Space, which will provide hands-on science, technology, engineering and math experiences for students and community members of all ages.\n\nThe company also launched a $100,000 local grant program to support Franklin County and Licking County nonprofits, schools and community organizations focused on STEM, sustainability, skills training and social impact. Awardees will be notified in mid-September and provided $50,000 to the New Albany Community Foundation.\n\nEastern Columbus suburbs reporter Maria DeVito can be reached at mdevito@dispatch.com and @mariadevito13.dispatch.com on Bluesky and @MariaDeVito13 on X.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:55:46.261187+00:00"}

However, with Palantir’s shares soaring 512% over the past year, is it too late to invest, or does it still offer a solid investment opportunity? Let’s explore—\n\nPalantir Reports Record Q2, Surpasses $1B Revenues\n\nPalantir's revenues hit $1 billion for the first time in the second quarter, rising 14% sequentially and 48% year over year. The company's earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter were $0.16, a 78% increase year over year. Both results beat Wall Street's estimates, which projected revenues of $939 million and an adjusted EPS of $0.14.\n\nRevenues were mainly driven by the U. S. commercial segment, with a steady flow of new customers attracted to Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Revenues from this segment reached $306 million, accounting for 31% of total revenues. This was a 20% increase from the previous quarter and a 93% rise year over year.\n\nPalantir's U. S. commercial customer count grew by 12% sequentially and 64% year over year. Furthermore, existing customers are spending more, as shown by Palantir's net dollar retention rate of 128%.\n\nPalantir Raises Full-Year Outlook, Confident of Future Growth\n\nThe company increased its full-year guidance, now expecting revenues between $4.142 billion and $4.150 billion, up from the previous forecast of $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion.\n\nFor the third quarter, Palantir projects revenues between $1.083 billion and $1.087 billion, surpassing Wall Street's estimate of $983 million. The company also upgraded its projections for operating income and cash flow for the entire year.\n\nAdditionally, Palantir's remaining performance obligation (RPO), or the revenues guaranteed by contracts but not yet recognized, jumped 77% to $2.42 billion in the second quarter. This indicates potential for future growth, and the outlook remains optimistic.\n\nPalantir's CEO, Alex Karp, expressed enthusiasm about the company's prospects, stating in the quarterly letter to shareholders that “this is still only the beginning of something much larger and, we believe, even more significant.”\n\nHow to Trade Palantir Stock Now\n\nPalantir's robust quarter, propelled by AI and optimistic growth outlooks, should reassure investors to hold onto their shares. Also, Palantir's steady defense contracts create significant barriers for new competitors, while an increase in commercial clients points to potential long-term expansion.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:55:50.832149+00:00"}

He is also the latest guest on Fortune’s new podcast, Crypto Playbook (available on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube), where Brukhman shared his insights based on a decade of investing—and offered some very practical tips for those coming to this market for the first time.\n\nHis first piece of advice for newcomers is that it’s safest to choose major cryptocurrencies that have an established track record. Doing so will let investors gain exposure to crypto, and benefit from its upswings, while also letting them stay clear of the hyper-volatility and outright scams that can come with newer projects.\n\n“As a new participant just entering the space, it is absolutely much safer to stick with the big names. You’re not going to go wrong if you are investing in Bitcoin, investing in Ethereum. These are projects that have been around for over 10 years at this point, and have very well established communities and ecosystems,” said Brukhman.\n\nCoinFund had the good fortune to invest in Ethereum when it was just 60 cents, compared with the nearly $4,000 it is trading for today, but his advice still holds.\n\nIn the podcast, Brukhman went on to note that, as the crypto industry has matured, a set of norms and guardrails has emerged to ensure blockchain projects are managed responsibly. These new practices focus primarily on token management and creating incentives to align founders and investors.\n\nIn the past, most notably during the initial coin offering (ICO) mania of 2016, blockchain project founders would rush to sell millions of tokens to retail investors—and then fail to follow through with their plans, causing the price of the token to slump or collapse altogether.\n\nToday, Brukhman notes, responsible projects will include governance measures to protect investors and to restrict the distribution of their token supplies over a time frame of several years. He says that 90% of the crypto projects CoinFund chooses to back have these attributes—which is a pretty clear indication that newer investors should also look for these qualities before putting down their money.\n\nFinally, Brukhman shared that his fund shies away from projects with anonymous founders. While this may seem obvious, it’s worth remembering that the original appeal of crypto for many people was as a new form of money that was not controlled by governments, and that protected the privacy of its users.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:56:02.380638+00:00"}

That will help them avoid heavy losses in a game in which the winners take all and the playing field is tilted heavily toward those with the biggest budgets.\n\nAccording to data from Bloomberg, four of the world’s largest tech firms – Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta – are expected to funnel more than $344 billion into capital expenditures this year, much of which will go toward data centers that feed their lofty AI ambitions.\n\nThey aren’t alone:\n\nAccording to data from Pitchbook, reported by CNBC in late July, AI startups raised more than $104 billion in the first half of 2025, nearly matching the total amount invested in AI startups in 2024. Around two-thirds of all venture funding during that period went to AI.\n\nAnd investors are devising their own AI infrastructure strategies, too. On Wednesday, Apollo Global Management agreed to acquire a majority stake in Stream Data Centers, and Brookfield Asset Management announced a strategy dedicated to developing AI infrastructure, aiming to capitalize on a “significant pipeline of opportunities.”\n\nThe firms are all vying for a piece of a market that’s estimated to be worth multiple trillions, said Brian Sathianathan, CTO and co-founder of Iterate.ai. Some are already starting to see the payoff. Industry darling Nvidia has been able to “sell and move servers with all the data center buildouts,” he said, and the three biggest cloud providers – Google, Amazon and Microsoft – are seeing significant growth. “It’s already working,” he said.\n\nThose that manage to win have a shot at massive returns. “This market’s got the potential to do that,” Sathianathan said. But with all the cash flowing into developments, some companies may be digging themselves into a hole that they’re not able to get out of, he said.\n\n“This is a winner takes all,” said Sathianathan. “If 20 players are vying for a spot that five can fill, then 15 are going to fail. That’s just the nature of free markets.”\n\nSo where does this leave the average enterprise? The best place to start is determining what “core competencies” your business has and how AI fits into them, Sathianathan said.\n\nWhen choosing an AI vendor, he added, it’s best not to put all your eggs in one basket. “I would warn enterprises from fully betting on one Big Tech firm,” he said. Doing so could create a “lock-in” that ends up making it more difficult to switch if better options present themselves. “Bet on a few, and also bet on startups,” he recommended.\n\n“Big companies have invested so much in this,” Sathianathan said. “They’re going to try and put you into a place where you are stuck with their software or their infrastructure.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:56:04.211130+00:00"}

The estimate has been unchanged in the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for total revenues is pinned at $1.08 billion.\n\nThis is CoreWeave’s second earnings release since it started trading as a listed company on March 28, 2025. CoreWeave is an AI-focused infrastructure company and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, CRWV reported a loss of $1.49 per share, which was much wider than a loss of 62 cents in the year-ago quarter. Loss per share includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition, which was satisfied at IPO.

The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors to Focus on Ahead of CRWV’s Q2 Earnings\n\nAmid the AI infrastructure boom, increasing demand for CoreWeave’s cloud software and infrastructure services is likely to have driven the top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, CRWV’s revenues jumped 420% year over year, ending the quarter with a backlog of $25.9 billion.\n\nBesides a $11.9 billion deal with OpenAI, CRWV has added several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client in the last reported quarter. It also signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer.

The amount of money flowing into this space is incredible, and with the results that many companies have announced recently, it's clear that this success will be ongoing for some time.\n\nSeveral companies could be bought right now with the mindset of holding for three to five years to outperform the market. Here are three of my favorites.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is the parent company of Google, Waymo, YouTube, and the Android operating system. It may look like it has a fairly wide product lineup, but most of its revenue is derived from advertising. Within the advertising segment, Google Search accounts for the majority of revenue.\n\nHowever, the market is worried that Google Search could be replaced by generative AI models, which would eliminate a huge chunk of Alphabet's revenue stream. This is a huge threat to Alphabet and its shareholders, and it's one of the reasons why Alphabet has a dirt-cheap valuation, trading for just 19 times forward earnings compared to the S&P 500's 24 times forward earnings.\n\nAlthough this is a real threat, there isn't a ton of evidence that this is playing out on a wide scale. Google's search engine market share is still 89.6%, and is also growing revenue rapidly. In Q2, its revenue rose 12% year over year.\n\nThis doesn't look like a dying business, and the market may have this one wrong. As a result, I think the risk-reward profile for Alphabet's stock is fantastic at this point, making it an excellent buy now.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) may not seem like an AI company at first glance, as its online commerce store isn't AI-centric. However, Amazon's largest profit driver, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a key beneficiary of the AI arms race.\n\nAWS is a cloud computing service that allows customers to rent computing power from Amazon. Renting computing power for training AI models has been a popular strategy, as it allows companies to pay as they go, rather than making a huge purchase for an AI supercomputer.\n\nWhile AWS isn't growing as quickly as some of its competitors, it still posted a strong growth rate of 17% in Q2. Furthermore, AWS generated over $10 billion in operating profits, which accounted for 53% of Amazon's total during Q2.\n\nAmazon is more of a cloud computing company than a commerce company right now, which bodes well for the future. With the stock falling after reporting Q2 results, I think it's an excellent buying opportunity right now.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%) is the world's leading chip foundry and is cashing in on the massive AI arms race spending spree. TSMC's chips go into many products, but the biggest growth driver right now is Nvidia's GPUs and other high-powered AI computing devices. Thanks to the massive demand for these products, TSMC's revenue is rapidly growing.\n\nIn Q2, revenue was up 44% in U.S. dollars, showcasing its strength. This strong growth is all a part of management's long-term vision of rapidly growing AI revenue over the next few years.\n\nAt the start of 2025, management stated that they expect AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with overall revenue increasing at nearly a 20% pace. Taiwan Semiconductor is delivering on that promise, and its strong growth should persist for some time.\n\nWith the stock trading for about the same price tag as the S&P 500 (24 times forward earnings), I think it's a smart stock to buy now and hold over the long term.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:56:12.723609+00:00"}

I'm not talking about finding stocks that can double in under a year, as there is more luck than anything in that approach. Instead, I'm looking for stocks that can double in under five years.\n\nThe rule of thumb is that the market doubles about once every seven years, so if a stock can double in five, it's a market outperformer. I think there are a handful of stocks that meet this threshold, and each looks like an excellent buy now.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and the Android operating system. However, the most important part of its business by far is Google Search. This division brings in over half of Alphabet's total revenue and has allowed Alphabet to fund various investments.\n\nBut Google Search is under attack. Investors are worried that Google Search will become a victim of generative AI and lose significant market share. While there is some anecdotal evidence that users are defecting from Google to generative AI, the vast majority of the population still uses Google Search.\n\nHowever, investors' fear of Google Search losing market share has caused the stock to fall to a cheap valuation. At less than 20 times forward earnings, Alphabet's stock is cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades for 24 times forward earnings.\n\nAlphabet's business is still growing, with Google Search's revenue rising 12% year over year in Q2 and companywide diluted earnings per share increasing 22%. Combined with Alphabet's cheap stock price, this makes the stock an easy candidate to double in under five years.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is a massive beneficiary of the AI arms race. TSMC is a chip foundry, which means it fabricates chips for companies that are unable to do so themselves. Considering there's only a handful of chip foundries globally, this makes TSMC a top competitor in an industry where there are few other options.\n\nThis cements TSMC at the top of a very important industry, making it a smart investment. It also has massive growth potential, as management projects revenue will increase at a nearly 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. A 20% CAGR over a five-year period results in a revenue gain of almost 150%, so this far exceeds the threshold needed to double in under five years.\n\nTSMC isn't as cheap as Alphabet, trading at 24.7 times forward earnings. However, that's nearly in line with the broader market, which reduces the overall risk of buying this stock today.\n\nAmazon\n\nAt first glance, Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) may not seem like a great candidate to double in five years, as its commerce platform is already dominant. However, that's not the Amazon story investors should be focused on.\n\nAmazon isn't a revenue growth story; it's a profit growth story. This is because Amazon's higher-margin divisions, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising, are growing much faster than the company as a whole. In Q2, Amazon's overall revenue rose 13% year over year.\n\nHowever, AWS saw sales rise 17% and advertising delivered an excellent 23% growth rate. With these two businesses growing much faster than the overall company, it means Amazon's profits will grow much faster, which is exactly what has happened over the past few quarters.\n\nAmazon's profit growth will drive it to double in under five years, and with the market's negative reaction to its Q2 earnings, it makes for an excellent stock to buy right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:56:14.306792+00:00"}

Datadog raised 2025 revenue guidance.\n\nNew York-based Datadog reported earnings before the market open. Datadog earnings for the June quarter came in 46 cents per share on an adjusted basis, up about 6% from a year earlier. The enterprise software maker's revenue climbed 28% to $827 million.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts expected Datadog to report profit of 41 cents a share on revenue of $791 million.\n\nFor the current quarter ending in September, Datadog forecast revenue of $849 million at the midpoint of guidance. Wall Street analysts modeled sales of $820 million.\n\nDatadog raised 2025 revenue guidance from $3.215 billion-$3.235 billion (20.5% growth at the midpoint) to $3.312-$3.322 billion (23.5% growth).\n\nDatadog Stock Rises On S&P 500 News\n\nOn the stock market today, Datadog stock climbed over 11% to 152.50 in early trading, after rebounding from the 50-day line on Wednesday. Shares have been consolidating since vaulting higher in early July on news that Datadog would join the S&P 500 index. Clearing that consolidation, which could be viewed as a handle to an enormous base, would offer an early entry.

Regardless of stock type, the key to building wealth is patience and a long-term mindset.\n\nAs Warren Buffett once said: \"If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes.\" It's often easier said than done with the stock market's volatility, but it should be on your mind anytime you're buying stocks.\n\nIf you're looking for growth stocks that are poised to be great investments over the next decade, look no further than the following two.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) is a company that doesn't need much of an introduction. The online bookstore-turned-Swiss Army knife of businesses has long been one of the top growth stocks in the stock market -- and it still has room to go.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce continues to be a cash cow, with its North America and international segments (which also include advertising, subscriptions, and third-party sellers) bringing in $100.1 billion (up 11% year over year) and $36.8 billion (up 16% year over year) in the second quarter, respectively.\n\nE-commerce will continue to be Amazon's foundation, but the microscope has been and will continue to be on its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Let's start with the positives of AWS. Although it was only 18% of Amazon's Q2 revenue, it continues to be the bulk of its profits (53% of its operating income).\n\nThe could-be-better news is that AWS is beginning to grow at a slower pace than smaller rivals like Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. AWS revenue grew 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion, while Azure and Google Cloud increased revenue by 34% and 32% in their latest quarters, respectively.\n\nAWS' modest growth seemed to disappoint investors, causing the stock to drop by over 8% in a single day. However, this dramatic reaction seems overdone, in my opinion. Although AWS is still the market leader, its size meant a slowdown was always likely.\n\nIf you're looking for a growth stock to hold on to for the long term, this recent drop in Amazon's stock gives it a much more attractive entry point, trading at 32.6 times forward earnings versus the 35.6 it was pre-drop. AWS is undoubtedly an important business for Amazon, but it has been actively (and effectively) expanding its business ventures.\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity company CrowdStrike (CRWD 2.23%) was in the news for all the wrong reasons last year after it was responsible for the worst IT outage in modern history. However, the company has remained resilient, and in July, the U.S. District Court of Western Texas dismissed a class action lawsuit against the company regarding the incident.\n\nThe reason to be excited about CrowdStrike over the next decade is twofold. First, CrowdStrike's cybersecurity solutions have proven they're some of the best in the industry. At the end of its fiscal first quarter, 48% of its customers used at least six of its modules (tools), 32% used at least seven, and 22% used at least eight.\n\nThis not only shows strong engagement, but it also helps CrowdStrike with retention because it's not easy for corporations to switch cybersecurity providers due to the logistical and financial costs involved in doing so. CrowdStrike ended the quarter with $4.4 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from $3.6 billion in the previous fiscal year's Q1.\n\nIts operating income declined by $12 million year over year, but that can be attributed to higher sales and marketing costs to recover from the impact of the July 2024 IT outage. I don't see this as a continuing trend for the company.\n\nThe other reason is the overall growth and importance of the cybersecurity industry. Cybersecurity has become a necessity for virtually any business connected to the internet. CrowdStrike estimates its total addressable market for AI-native security solutions at $116 billion this year and reaching $250 billion in 2029.\n\nCrowdStrike is fairly expensive, trading at 23.6 times its forward sales, but if you're planning to hold it for at least a decade, this alone shouldn't be a deterrent. If anything, I recommend taking the dollar-cost averaging approach, slowly but surely buying shares.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:56:17.797285+00:00"}

That's giving Alphabet and Amazon an opportunity to overtake Apple's valuation.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/07/prediction-2-stocks-thatll-be-worth-more-than-appl/", "published_at": "2025-08-07T10:45:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Apple is still trying to find its AI footing. That's giving Alphabet and Amazon an opportunity to overtake Apple's valuation.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $3 trillion, Apple (AAPL 1.13%) is one of the most valuable publicly traded companies. But the company is lagging behind some of its rivals when it comes to an artificial intelligence strategy, and that's giving other tech companies the potential to eventually leapfrog Apple's market cap in the coming years.\n\nWhile comparing investment opportunities solely based on market cap does paint the entire picture, it's worth considering how some rival tech giants could outpace Apple as they invest in new opportunities. Here's why Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) and Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) could outpace Apple over the next few years.\n\nAmazon has many irons in the fire\n\nAmazon has a market cap of $2.3 trillion right now, and while the company's share price may have stumbled lately, I think some investors are missing the big picture, which is that Amazon continues to be the dominant force in several markets.\n\nFirst, Amazon is the leading cloud computing company with about 30% of the market. Yes, Microsoft has chipped away at its lead over the past few years, but Amazon still holds the No. 1 spot and still benefits from significant sales growth from its Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAWS sales rose by 18% in the second quarter of 2025, which beat estimates but was below some of its competitors' cloud growth. CEO Andy Jassy has assured investors that his company is committed to its AI cloud computing future and is spending an estimated $118 billion to keep pace with rivals.\n\nAnd then there's the company's e-commerce dominance. Amazon captured about 38% of the e-commerce market in the U.S., leaving Walmart and Target with just 6% and 2%, respectively. With more than 200 million Prime members, Amazon has a customer base that's locked to its platform, and it shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nWhat's more, Amazon is now an advertising powerhouse. The company's ad sales grew 23% in Q2 to $15.7 billion, and it's the company's fastest-growing business. This is an important market for Amazon as the U.S. digital advertising segment expands into a $490 billion market by 2029.\n\nWhen you combine Amazon's long-term opportunities in AI cloud computing, its e-commerce dominance, and its rapidly expanding advertising business, there's plenty of room for Amazon to grow larger over the next several years and potentially overtake Apple's valuation.\n\nAlphabet is making big strides in AI\n\nWith its market cap of $2.3 trillion, Alphabet has the chance to overtake Apple over the next three years as the company continues to benefit from its strong position in AI.\n\nTwo of the most significant ways it can do this are through the company's Gemini chatbot and through its Google cloud services. Gemini usage is growing quickly, with the company having an estimated 400 million monthly active users already.\n\nAlphabet does have its work cut out for it as the company transitions its traditional search tools to its AI Mode, which provides conversational responses to queries, but management says it will expand embedding ads within the AI Mode responses. The company is also implementing AI-powered ads for some of its users, with over 2 million advertisers now using the platform, a 50% increase from the same time last year.\n\nAnd then there's the growth from Google Cloud. While the company is behind Amazon's and Microsoft's market share -- Google has 12% of the market -- it's made significant strides over the past few years, and revenue is growing. Google Cloud sales were up 32% in Q2 to $13.6 billion, and it recently doubled the number of customer deals worth $250 million or more.\n\nWhat's more, Alphabet's shares are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 20, below the S&P 500 index's average of about 29, Alphabet stock looks like a good value right now.\n\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet appear to be taking the appropriate steps to benefit from artificial intelligence and to maintain their dominance in their respective markets.

Buy the Dip?", "summary": "Shares were slammed following the e-commerce and cloud-computing company's last earnings report.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/07/amazon-stock-just-got-pummeled-buy-the-dip/", "published_at": "2025-08-07T10:05:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Shares were slammed following the e-commerce and cloud-computing company's last earnings report.\n\nDespite reporting second-quarter revenue and earnings per share far ahead of analysts' average estimate for the period, shares of Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) sold off sharply following the earnings report. As of this writing, the stock is down about 8% since the report in late July. The main reason for the stock's severe decline is likely the company's lower than anticipated growth in its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The market may be worried that much faster growth at Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) and Alphabet's (GOOGL 1.14%) cloud businesses is a sign that the important Amazon service is losing its edge in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, investors may have some concerns about Amazon's guidance for third-quarter profitability.\n\nBut has the market overreacted? I believe so. Yes, AWS's slowing growth is something investors should keep an eye on. But the stock's pullback has arguably more than compensated for the increased risks associated with this part of Amazon's sprawling business.\n\nWhat spooked investors\n\nOn the surface of Amazon's second-quarter results, the company crushed it. The e-commerce and cloud-computing juggernaut reported revenue of $167.7 billion, up 13% year over year. Earnings per share grew even faster, climbing 33% to $1.68. The consensus analyst forecast called for revenue and earnings per share of just $162.1 billion and $1.33, respectively.\n\nMaking the report look even better, the company guided for another quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Q3. Specifically, management said it expected revenue for the period to be between $174.0 billion and $179.5 billion, translating to 10% to 13% year-over-year growth.\n\nStill, the company may have missed the mark in the report in two areas.\n\nFirst, AWS revenue grew about 18% year over year. That's a meager growth rate compared with the 39% and 32% year-over-year revenue growth seen at Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, respectively. These two competitors' revenue in their cloud businesses was significantly higher than analysts' average forecasts for the important units, while Amazon's barely beat forecasts. Investors may be concerned that Amazon's lower growth indicates the company isn't effectively capitalizing on cloud-computing opportunities in the rapidly expanding AI services market.\n\nAnother potential reason for investor skittishness is Amazon's guidance for third-quarter operating income to be between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion. The midpoint of this guidance range is $18 billion, representing only 3% year-over-year growth.\n\nA buying opportunity\n\nBut here's where things turn optimistic for investors. Sure, shares have taken a painful hit. But with the stock down more than 9%, the market has arguably overreacted to Amazon's more modest cloud growth compared to its competitors, and to management's muted expectations for third-quarter profitability.\n\nZooming out, this is still a business growing its sales at double-digit rates. In addition, its business is supported by both a robust e-commerce business and a cloud business, which has just nearly 18% year-over-year top-line growth -- slightly faster than the segment's growth rate in the prior quarter. Sure, it may not be as fast as Azure's and Google Cloud's growth. But it's still a very strong rate.\n\nWith the stock now trading at just 33 times earnings, this is a rare opportunity for investors to buy into one of the United States' best companies at a reasonable valuation. Sure, there's no telling where the bottom is. Shares could get cheaper. Additionally, the risks of Amazon losing its edge as AI becomes more central to cloud computing are real. Investors, therefore, will have to continue keeping tabs on how AWS performs in the coming quarters. Ultimately, however, risks seem largely priced in. The long-term investment outcome from this price will likely be respectable.\n\nSo should investors buy the dip in Amazon stock? I think so.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:56:23.247992+00:00"}

The move, according to the Wall Street Journal, was driven in part by the company’s partnership with OpenAI and the company leaning into AI to help handle things like HR support and some junior roles.\n\nIt can also mean the collapse or conflation of traditional team structures.\n\nOne key theme of organizations that are pivoting to “AI-first” structures is a kind of “flattening” of company structure, which essentially means fewer layers of management oversight, the removal of junior or support roles, and a growing reliance on AI systems to handle tasks that were once handled by human employees.\n\nWhile the utopian idea of a world without tasks like editing Excel spreadsheets or sorting through files sounds great in theory, what does an AI-first organization actually look like in practice?\n\nTech bosses have been keen to promote a vision where AI automates the drudgery of work, cutting out admin while allowing soft skills and creativity to flourish. Or, as Microsoft’s Satya Nadella put it earlier this year: “I think with AI and work with my colleagues.”\n\nAs business leaders race to integrate AI across their operations, entry-level roles are disappearing, management layers are thinning, and traditional team roles are starting to blur. Across the Fortune 500, middle management is taking hits, as are entry-level workers, but even at the C-suite, new power dynamics are at play as the old pyramid structure of corporate life starts to flatten out.\n\nAI isn’t just a new tool for the modern workplace; it’s quietly reshaping how companies are organized.\n\nAt Moderna, HR and tech now live under the same roof overseen by one Chief People and Digital Officer. At another one AI-first healthcare company, a team of 10 software engineers have been replaced with three person unit overseeing AI agents. At Amazon, layers of middle management are being stripped out as part of a broader push toward a leaner, AI-ready structure.\n\nThe traditional corporate org chart, a neat triangle of power with executives at the top and junior workers at the base, is undergoing a quiet revolution, thanks to AI.\n\nAI is quietly changing the traditional corporate hierarchy, flattening structures and reshaping job roles from the bottom up. Companies like Amazon , Moderna , and McKinsey are eliminating layers of middle management, merging departments, and deploying AI agents to automate routine work. As AI automates various tasks, even the C-suite is changing, with new AI leadership roles emerging and long-held power dynamics shifting.\n\n繼續閱讀\n\nAt consulting giant McKinsey, the company is deploying thousands of AI agents to support consultants with tasks such as building decks, summarizing research, and verifying the logic of arguments. On top of this, around 40% of the company’s revenue now comes from advising on AI and related technologies.\n\n“If you’re an AI-first organization, you can use these AI agents to essentially do a lot of the execution work of organizations,” Nick South, the managing director and senior partner of Boston Consulting Group, told Fortune. “And when we organize our processes and our delivery processes around this AI native workforce, the role of the humans, then, is different.”\n\nThis is partly because the nature of individual job roles will change as tasks get automated by AI tools or agents.\n\n“Our job roles get kind of deconstructed, because some tasks might be taken over by AI and others might be new, so the meaning, or the function of the job changes,” Eva Selenko, a professor of work psychology at Loughborough Business School, said. “You might need less of the one role, but that person will take over another function from another thing.”\n\nThis doesn’t mean that entire jobs will be replaced, but it could mean employees’ roles become more diverse and take on tasks outside their normal scope of duties, or even their usual team. Job roles get deconstructed as tasks get automated, and their importance in the organization changes, Selenko said. As a result, strict divisions between teams may start to blur.\n\nMix all this in with a few AI agents carrying out autonomous work, and the traditional org chart starts to look dramatically different.\n\n“Now we’re moving to this more flat network of human teams supervising AI agents,” Rob Levin, McKinsey senior partner and a leader of QuantumBlack, McKinsey’s AI arm, said.\n\n“In early examples, we’re seeing that a client company that’s building an agent factory supporting multiple business workflows, about 50 to 100 AI agents can be managed by just two or three people,” he said.\n\nIn one example, Levin said a healthcare company had replaced a traditional 10-person software development team with much smaller, three-person units. These consist of a product owner, a software engineer who can effectively prompt AI coding tools, and a systems architect who ensures integration with the company’s broader tech ecosystem.\n\nHowever, these kinds of major structural changes are easier to implement in smaller organizations or startups rather than in larger companies that have more complicated structures.\n\nThe plight of the middle manager\n\nOne of the ways companies, especially in the tech sector, have tried to simplify and flatten their structures for the AI age is to slash employees at the managerial level. Palantir CEO Alex Karp, for instance, announced on Monday’s earnings call that he intended to cull 500 roles from his 4,100-person staff. he called it a “crazy, efficient revolution.”\n\nMiddle managers have especially taken a lot of flak, especially from the likes of Big Tech CEOs such as Andy Jassy, who has said that middle managers can hinder speed, ownership, and innovation at Amazon, particularly in the context of AI-driven organizational change.\n\nJassy is currently pursuing a flatter company structure at Amazon by increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers, aiming to remove layers and streamline decision-making.\n\nHowever, experts told Fortune organizations shouldn’t be counting out middle managers just yet.\n\n“One obvious possibility [of flatter organizations] is that it’s going to cause some sort of managerial thinning,” said Tristan L. Botelho, an associate professor of organizational behavior at Yale School of Management. “If AI is reducing the coordination burden, it could shrink the role of middle management, whose job it was previously to make these connections.”\n\nHowever, while AI might change how middle managers work, Botelho does not expect them to disappear completely.\n\n“I don’t think middle management is going to be erased. I think it’s going to just redefine how managers think about their role within the organization,” he said. “One thing I often talk about a lot with executives…is this kind of idea that AI integrated with the organization, should…level up your skill set as a manager.”\n\nIn the AI age, soft skills also become increasingly important, with middle managers serving vital HR functions. Employees still need to be managed, and a workforce still needs to function with empathy or organizations risk losing their best performers.\n\n“There is a human side of things,” Stella Pachidi, a Senior Lecturer in Technology and Work at King’s Business School, said. “It’s not sustainable to just have a boss as an algorithm, it’s not going to work in the longer term.”\n\nIn contrast to the Big Tech narrative, some experts say the managerial class will expand within traditional organizational structures as automation replaces low-level work.\n\nBCG’s Nick South told Fortune that execution-level jobs, which are typically at the bottom of the org chart, will be the first on the chopping block due to AI agents, while the managerial or “orchestration” level will grow in complexity and importance.\n\n“At the orchestration layer, that will need to be bigger than it is today…there’ll be a critical human part of that, which is about making sure that all this stuff is doing things,” he said.\n\n“If you think about a classic middle manager profile, it’s sort of a general manager skill set. But what these people are going to need in the future is a combination of sufficient AI proficiency to manage a human-agentic workforce, plus the core skills of logic, understanding of ethics, rhetoric, and communication skills, so that they can communicate with others in much less siloed organizations,” he said. “So those orchestration roles are going to be quite complex.”\n\nThe new C-suite\n\nWhile middle managers and entry-level employees may be feeling the brunt of the AI burden, these changes go right to the top.\n\nAI is already shifting the power dynamics in the C-suite and creating new, powerful, executive-level jobs. According to a 2023 Foundry study on AI Priorities, 11% of mid- to large-sized companies have already appointed someone to serve as “Chief AI Officer” (CAIO), while an additional 21% are currently in the process of recruiting for the role.\n\nAccording to LinkedIn’s 2023 report on AI at work, companies with a “Head of AI” position around the world had more than tripled in the five years, growing by 13% from 2022.\n\nAlex Connock, a senior fellow at the University of Oxford’s Said Business School, has observed the growth of these roles firsthand.\n\n“Whilst it was perhaps relatively rare when we first launched our AI for business programmes a few years ago, we now have many people … on our executive courses with the title of Chief AI Officer,” he told Fortune. “It’s the new mainstream. The level of interest transcends all levels, from the 20-year-old undergrads … up to seasoned executives.”\n\nWhile there’s some debate about whether these roles will stand the test of time, for example, experts have said that these roles can lack a clear purpose or authority, the executive level is not immune to the AI boom.\n\nSouth said that while the rise of some of these roles could also be a symptom of our immaturity with AI rather than a direct need for this work, the C-suite will still have to take on new responsibilities in the AI age.\n\n“People feel quite nervous about missing the boat,” he said. “I think it will be interesting to see how this evolves over time … as things settle down, how different will that be to the classic chief data officer?”\n\nBut here is a new “responsibility in the C-suite … to think about our competitive landscape, where are the potential sources of disruption, how we protect our sources of advantage. These are C-suite questions, and it would be a mistake to think, if we hire a chief AI officer, somehow we leave that with them. This is a really top-level thing to be thinking strategically about.”\n\nWhile AI is set to disrupt all levels of organizations, Selenko noted that management structures are likely to protect those at the top from too much turmoil.\n\n“In an influential management structure, if those at the top’s job might be partly doable by an AI, they will not give up that power. So I think you will see this shift in power balance is probably more among less powerful positions in an organization,” she said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:56:25.069220+00:00"}

Judging by the fact that the share price was down nearly 10% (as of Aug. 4) from the day of the announcement on July 31, the market clearly hasn't been happy with the update that management provided.\n\nRevenue totaled $167.7 billion, with diluted earnings per share coming in at $1.68. These two headline figures were ahead of Wall Street's expectations. It wasn't even close. However, the leadership team's guidance was for operating income to be $18 billion (at the midpoint) for the third quarter, well below analysts' $19.5 billion forecast.\n\nIt's important that investors are keeping up with Amazon's most recent financial performance. But these things should be viewed with the bigger picture in mind. Is this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock a smart long-term buy?\n\nGrowth is picking up\n\nDuring Q2, Amazon's top line grew at a 13.3% year-over-year rate. This was an acceleration compared to the first quarter, which is obviously an encouraging sign. What's remarkable is that the business is expanding at a strong clip, despite collecting a massive $670 billion in net sales in the last 12 months. Even at its current size, growth is still a part of the Amazon story.\n\nThe North America segment posted an 11% revenue gain. This was the fastest expansion rate since Q1 2024. The company had its biggest Prime Day ever. It also expanded same-day and next-day delivery in the U.S.\n\nAmazon's digital advertising segment deserves some attention. Revenue soared 22% to $15.7 billion. This is becoming a more important money-maker for the company. Amazon is behind only Meta Platforms and Alphabet when it comes to digital ad sales.\n\nInvestors who believed that Amazon's growth engine was slowing got a pleasant surprise. Perhaps the business still has many years left of double-digit revenue gains as we look ahead.\n\nIs AWS losing its luster?\n\nThe most exciting part of Amazon has nothing to do with online shopping or digital advertising. Instead, it's Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing platform with industry-leading market share, that investors seem to focus on the most. The latest financial update might have given shareholders a reason to be cautious.\n\nAWS registered 17.5% year-over-year revenue growth to $30.9 billion. That number was slightly ahead of analyst estimates. However, it's worth pointing out that the two biggest rivals, Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, are both growing at much faster rates. This means that AWS is losing market share.\n\nWhat's more, AWS' operating income increased by just 9.7%, lower than the revenue gain, as expenses crept up. But CEO Andy Jassy remains very confident on the opportunity AWS has.\n\n\"I say this frequently, but remember that 85 to 90% of worldwide IT spend is still on premises versus in the cloud,\" he pointed out on the Q2 2025 earnings call.\n\nThere will also continue to be robust demand from customers looking to use the expanding set of artificial intelligence (AI) tools.\n\nFor what it's worth, investors must get comfortable with the amount of spending happening, as Amazon could undertake almost $120 billion in capital expenditures just this year. If the business didn't do this, then it would risk falling behind in the AI race.\n\nBuy the dip\n\nAs of Aug. 4, shares of Amazon trade 13% below their peak from February. I view this dip as a smart buying opportunity. Investors have the chance right now to add one of the world's top companies to their portfolios at a time when the market is pessimistic about the latest financial results. Over the long term, this business will remain a dominant tech leader, even though the numbers each quarter could vary substantially. I still think patient investors should be rewarded.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:56:26.537172+00:00"}

DHL has the right to extend the agreement two times for two-year terms, potentially stretching the deal until March 2037.\n\nIn early July, Cargojet extended its contract with Amazon for four years.

Wednesday’s announcement will bring Apple’s cumulative commitment to $600 billion.\n\n“President Trump’s America First economic agenda has secured trillions of dollars in investments that support American jobs and bolster American businesses,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement. “Today’s announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America’s economic and national security.”\n\nThe move is part of a push toward assembling additional critical components domestically, according to a White House official who detailed the announcement on the condition of anonymity. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is expected to attend the White House event.\n\nCorning will dedicate an entire factory in Kentucky to Apple glass production, increasing that company’s workforce in the state by 50%, the iPhone maker said. Corning was already a supplier to Apple, making glass for the very first iPhone at the same factory.\n\nAs part of what it calls the American Manufacturing Program, or AMP, Apple promised to bring more of its supply chain and advanced production to the US. The company’s AMP partners include glassmaker Corning Inc., Applied Materials Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and others, the company said.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. committed to spending another $100 billion on domestic manufacturing ahead of an event with President Donald Trump, marking the latest pledge by the tech giant to increase US production as it seeks to avoid punishing tariffs on its flagship iPhones.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump signed an order Wednesday hiking tariffs on goods from India by an additional 25% over its purchases of Russian oil, on top of a 25% country-specific duty set to take effect Thursday.\n\nWhile Apple’s promised investment is substantial, it stops short of the full shift to US-based production that Trump and top White House officials have envisioned.\n\nEarlier this year, the president threatened to hit Apple with a tariff of at least 25% if it didn’t move manufacturing of the iPhone to the US, a day after meeting with Cook at the White House. Trump administration officials have suggested that Apple could assemble its phones and other electronics domestically using robotics.\n\nApple said last week that it took an $800 million hit from tariffs in the June quarter — slightly less than previously projected — and expected them to add $1.1 billion its costs in the September quarter, assuming no policy changes or new duties.\n\nDuring a call last week with analysts, Cook said “the vast majority” of iPhones sold in the US come from India, while the bulk of other products, such as MacBooks, iPads and Apple Watches, sold in the US are manufactured in Vietnam.\n\n“We obviously try to optimize our supply chain,” Cook said at the time. “And ultimately, we will do more in the United States.”\n\nBut onshoring manufacturing, particularly for the iPhone product line, would amount to a massive undertaking for Apple, whose facilities in China and India employ several hundred thousand people and involve heavily customized processes.\n\nInstead, Cook has led a push to win a tariff carve-out for the company’s most important products. Trump is readying plans to unveil levies on all products containing semiconductor chips as soon as next week. Separately, the president’s country-specific tariffs on dozens of trading partners are set to take effect on Thursday.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Apple was able to convince Trump to exempt its products from import taxes. If Cook is able to do so again, it could help the company avoid costs that analysts expected to erode profit margins and increase consumer prices — or even offer a competitive advantage over foreign rivals including Samsung Electronics Co.\n\nCook has sought to curry favor with Trump over a series of private meetings and dinners, and was among a small group of tech leaders — including Elon Musk, Alphabet Inc.’s Sundar Pichai, Meta Platforms Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos — who attended the president’s second inauguration at the US Capitol.\n\nStill, Apple’s initial $500 billion, 20,000-job pledge, first announced in February, represented just a slight acceleration over its prior investments and previously announced plans, adding $39 billion in spending and an additional 1,000 jobs annually.\n\nThe Apple event is the latest in a flurry of announcements Trump has made alongside corporate leaders who have said they plan to increase their US presence.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump announced a $100 billion investment in artificial intelligence data centers from Oracle Corp., SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI Inc. — with a goal of increasing the total to at least $500 billion — a bid to boost American innovation in technology and artificial technology. OpenAI and Oracle later announced they will develop 4.5 gigawatts of additional US data-center capacity in an expanded partnership.\n\nThe president has also ramped up partnerships with key players in the chip industry, announcing that Nvidia Corp., the dominant player in chips for AI models, plans to produce as much as half a trillion dollars’ worth of AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years through manufacturing partnerships.\n\nTrump has also made securing investments a key part of negotiating with other countries on geopolitical issues, such as trade.\n\nPart of the US’ deal with the European Union included an agreement from the EU to purchase $750 billion in American energy products and invest $600 billion in the US, while the president’s deal with Japan includes the creation of a $550 billion fund to make investments in the US.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:56:34.850725+00:00"}

Zoox had argued that it did and announced in July 2022 that it had self-certified; NHTSA balked. The agency opened an investigation in March 2023 to look into the matter, and specifically the process and data that Zoox had used to self-certify.\n\nThe investigation didn’t slow Zoox’s development and testing of its autonomous vehicle technology. In early 2023, Zoox began testing its custom-built robotaxis, which don’t have a steering wheel or other traditional controls, on public roads near its Foster City, California headquarters. The company has since expanded its testing footprint to Las Vegas and San Francisco.\n\nZoox does not operate a commercial service yet. However, in San Francisco it has opened its robotaxis up to employees and hosted family and friends. Earlier this year, the company launched an Zoox Explorer program, aimed at early public riders, in Las Vegas.\n\nFor now, the exemption allows Zoox to demonstrate the robotaxis, not operate them commercially.\n\nNHTSA’s announcement is connected to its new national framework, which the agency argues will make it easier for companies to deploy autonomous vehicles without traditional manual driving controls — like steering wheels, pedals, and sideview mirrors — at scale.\n\nThe framework allows NHTSA to green-light the sale and commercialization of autonomous vehicles that are not compliant with federal safety standards due to a lack of manual controls.\n\nThe revised process involves an expedited application that allows companies like Zoox to receive exemptions for testing and demonstrations, and eventually, commercial operations. Zoox spokesperson Whitney Jencks said in an email that Zoox is working in close cooperation with NHTSA on this process, beginning with the demonstration exemption and followed by the commercial exemption.\n\nAs part of the agreement, NHTSA has closed its investigation into Zoox’s self-certification of its AVs.

Amazon will offer the tools through its Bedrock and SageMaker offerings. The software platforms help enterprises create AI applications using their data.\n\nAnalysts cheered the move for AWS. The announcement comes less than a week after so-so cloud revenue results for Amazon caused investors to questions whether it was falling behind Microsoft and Google Cloud.\n\n\"We see the addition of OpenAI to the AWS platform, while far from a comprehensive deal, as a positive initial step in the relationship, suggesting the companies are interested in working together,\" wrote BofA Securities analyst Justin Post in a client note Wednesday. \"AWS still does not benefit from OpenAI infrastructure spend like its peers — and may not be that focused on it given capacity constraints — but can now generate revenue from services around OpenAI's models leveraging its vertically integrated AI-stack.\"\n\nOn the stock market today, Amazon is up 3.7% at 221.66. Shares pushed back above Amazon's 50-day moving average after tumbling below the key level last week.\n\nAmazon-OpenAI 'Powerhouse Combo'\n\nAmazon Web Services Chief Executive Matt Garman wrote on LinkedIn Tuesday that OpenAI and AWS were forming a \"powerhouse combination.\"\n\n\"This brings together OpenAI's leading technology with AWS's scale, security, and deployment capabilities,\" he wrote.\n\nOpenAI is partnered with Microsoft, which is also one of the startup's largest investors. Microsoft gained a big AI advantage as OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider. Parts of that deal were adjusted in January, however, to allow OpenAI to train its models on infrastructure from other cloud providers, such as Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV).\n\nDifferent from its more powerful \"closed\" AI models, OpenAI released the new open weight models freely for developers and through a range of partners. The list includes Hugging Face, AWS, Microsoft Azure and Databricks, OpenAI said in a blog post.\n\nThe arrangement \"represents a nice first step in the OpenAI + AWS relationship and we continue to believe that if it expands further, it could be a catalyst for Amazon's stock,\" New Street Research analyst Dan Salmon wrote to clients late Tuesday.\n\nAWS already offers access to open source models from Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL), he noted.\n\n\"So the addition is not ground-breaking, and still a long way — and one important contractual clause — from offering OpenAI's closed models, including the upcoming GPT-5,\" Salmon wrote.\n\nAmazon Stock: Q2 Earnings Slide\n\nAmazon stock is trading nearly flat so far this year, even with Wednesday's gain. Shares slid 8% following Amazon's Q2 earnings report, which showed cloud growth just in-line with estimates.\n\nWhile Amazon's e-commerce business is its main source of revenue, AWS drives the majority of profits. Growth for AWS has come back into focus as concerns about tariffs have (mostly) faded. That had allowed Amazon to bounce back from lows in April before the earnings setback.\n\nAmazon's slower growth compared to Microsoft and Google raised concerns that its two smaller cloud competitors were more successful in winning AI business. But BofA's Post said Wednesday that he remains \"constructive\" on Amazon's AI potential and could see the OpenAI arrangement growing further.\n\n\"While any future Open AI deal may be subject to contractual limitations (with Microsoft), we think AWS would be very interested in adding more OpenAI capabilities, and AWS has a lot of customer reach to offer OpenAI as the company focuses on building out enterprise business,\" Post wrote.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nUber Posts Q2 Sales Beat, $20 Billion Buyback Plan.

After all, that’s where the chip giant realizes revenue on the sale of its high-powered AI processors.\n\nBut the Data Center segment includes more than just chip sales. It also accounts for some of Nvidia’s most important, though often overlooked, offerings: its networking technologies.\n\nComposed of its NVLink, InfiniBand, and Ethernet solutions, Nvidia’s networking products are what allow its chips to communicate with each other, let servers talk to each other inside massive data centers, and ultimately ensure end users can connect to it all to run AI applications.\n\n“The most important part in building a supercomputer is the infrastructure. The most important part is how you connect those computing engines together to form that larger unit of computing,” explained Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of networking at Nvidia.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang attends the 9th edition of the VivaTech trade show at the Parc des Expositions de la Porte de Versailles on June 11, 2025, in Paris. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) · Chesnot via Getty Images\n\nThat also translates into some big sales. Nvidia’s networking sales accounted for $12.9 billion of its $115.1 billion in data center revenue in its prior fiscal year. That might not seem impressive when you consider that chip sales brought in $102.1 billion, but it eclipses the $11.3 billion that Nvidia’s second-largest segment, Gaming, took in for the year.\n\nIn Q1, networking made up $4.9 billion of Nvidia’s $39.1 billion in data center revenue. And it’ll continue to grow as customers continue to build out their AI capacity, whether that’s at research universities or massive data centers.\n\n“It is the most underappreciated part of Nvidia's business, by orders of magnitude,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “Basically, networking doesn't get the attention because it's 11% of revenue. But it's growing like a rocket ship.”\n\nConnecting thousands of chips\n\nWhen it comes to the AI explosion, Nvidia senior vice president of networking Kevin Deierling says the company has to work across three different types of networks. The first is its NVLink technology, which connects GPUs to each other within a server or multiple servers inside of a tall, cabinet-like server rack, allowing them to communicate and boost overall performance.\n\nThen there’s InfiniBand, which connects multiple server nodes across data centers to form what is essentially a massive AI computer. Then there’s the front-end network for storage and system management, which uses Ethernet connectivity.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang presents a Grace Blackwell NVLink72 as he delivers a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025.

Integrations with Amazon’s own grocery service could also have it make shopping lists by speaking to it, and then have those products delivered. Essentially, it’s aiming to bring agentic AI into the home.\n\nThe company teased that this improved Alexa could do more than set timers and alarms, control smart home devices, and answer questions. She leverages generative AI to make sense of information stored in Amazon users’ accounts, understand their schedules, and their preferences. She can remember things, process files, and summarize a Ring camera’s footage.\n\nIn February 2025, Amazon announced a complete makeover of its digital voice assistant with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI. That service began rolling out slowly to customers in March and is now available to “many millions” of users, Amazon says. The system is also model-agnostic, meaning Alexa+ can use whatever she needs in the moment to answer the question or complete the task. Alexa+ is using models from Anthropic and Amazon Nova , among others.\n\nAmazon’s assistant, which once gave its users Star Trek vibes as they ordered their home computer to close the blinds or turn off the lights or order milk, no longer seems as revolutionary in the ChatGPT era. Today, people can engage with AI via text and voice chat. Modern AI chatbots and AI-powered services can answer so many more questions, are imaginative, can reason, can create images and art, and generate videos, and with the agentic AI, they can even perform online tasks on your behalf.\n\nTo find out whether Alexa is still the best smart assistant for my family, I’m going to test Amazon’s AI-powered devices, experiment with AI queries, and write out my thoughts in a multi-part series. With this series, I hope to offer consumers insights as to how well Alexa works in various real-world situations, not company demos.\n\nWith the total loss of the home due to a March 2024 house fire , there also came a new opportunity: We could now make a fresh start to create a more modernized smart home after rebuilding our house. But whether Alexa still deserves to be the center of our connected home remains to be seen.\n\nI owned a lot of Alexa-powered devices in my former home: There were Amazon Echos in most rooms, including an older Echo Plus in the living room, a smattering of Dots, a Spot in a bedroom, and an Echo Show in the kitchen. A Fire TV ran in the bedroom. And, in a drawer, a rarely used Fire HD tablet sat collecting dust.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut before we can get to that, let’s see how Alexa+ handles the basics.\n\nIn the first part of this series, I’m going to set up Alexa+, use the app, and ask the assistant some questions that only the new Alexa+ can do. Later, I’ll test the agentic AI features and smart home integrations.\n\nSetting up Alexa+ on an Echo Spot\n\nDevice: Echo Spot\n\nDefault music service: Spotify (Premium)\n\nBefore moving to my new home, I put Alexa+ to the test on a brand-new Echo Spot after being accepted into the beta. Since I couldn’t yet hook up smart home devices in the Airbnb that’s served as a temporary residence for over a year, I initially tried to test the device’s AI in other ways.\n\nMainly, I wanted to know if Alexa+ was really all that smart and useful, and if she could do all the things Amazon promised.\n\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\n\nSetting up the Spot was easier than it was with past devices, as now you only need to scan a QR code to get the process started in the Alexa app. The app connected automatically to the home’s Wi-Fi; no more weird toggling between the device’s network and your own Wi-Fi.\n\nOn the next screen, I accepted the invite to upgrade to the new Alexa+ for free, knowing that it’s still possible to downgrade to the old Alexa service at any time, if things go wrong.\n\nOnboarding included a short video that explained that Alexa would learn more as I use her, and instructed me on how to talk to Alexa. I then connected my Google account, giving Alexa access to my inbox and calendar.\n\nI ended up on a blank page after doing so, oddly, but after closing the window, the screen informed me that my “Account Linked.” (Disclosure: I am running the iOS 26 developer beta on my iPhone, so maybe that’s the problem?)\n\nImage Credits:Alexa app screenshot\n\nOn the following screen, I picked the services I wanted to use with Alexa+, which today include OpenTable, Ticketmaster, Uber, and Thumbtack. I checked all the boxes, then moved to the following screen to grant the necessary permissions, one by one.\n\nWhile it’s a bit tedious to do so — and something that could be even more tedious in time as more services are added — I did appreciate that it felt like I was in control of the data sharing and could see exactly what each service was requesting before agreeing.\n\nImage Credits:Alexa app screenshot\n\nThe following screen confirmed that Fodor’s travel planning service was already integrated with Alexa+, but it didn’t require permissions. It also noted that services like Uber Eats, Grubhub, and Vagaro would be added later on.\n\nImage Credits:Alexa app screenshot\n\nThe Alexa app itself is still sorely lacking in user interface design. Despite many updates, the app still feels somehow both plain and too busy. It lacks color and traditional mobile app navigation patterns, and it tries to cram too many examples of “things to do” on its home screen.\n\nMeanwhile, trying to locate how to do the necessary first steps — like linking my preferred music service — is buried in the interface. Nope, you don’t tap on your profile icon, Settings, and then scroll down to “Preferred service providers.” For some reason, that’s where you set your preferred News, Calendar, and Email providers, but not your preferred Music service.\n\nImage Credits:Alexa app screenshot\n\nInstead, you tap on the hamburger menu at the bottom of the screen. You then tap on the “Music & More” screen. (What’s the “More”? Podcasts? Audiobooks?)\n\nImage Credits:Alexa app screenshot\n\nI set Spotify as my default music service, the default choice for artists and genre stations, and the default for podcasts. There was no option to set my default audiobooks service.\n\nIn this section, there was also a list of services I had previously linked with Alexa. Here, Amazon’s Audible — which I would prefer to set as the default for audiobooks — was listed alongside other streamers, like Pandora, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and others. But when I tapped on Audible, I simply got an error that says “You’ve reached the end of Alexa’s knowledge. Just kidding. This skill no longer exists. Click here to go back.”\n\nUh, OK. I mean, would it not make sense to just remove the broken thing that no longer exists?\n\nImage Credits:Alexa app screenshot\n\nIn any event, I’m here to try Alexa+, not yell at a poorly designed mobile app.\n\nI’ll figure out audiobooks later, I guess.\n\nNote for this series:\n\nIn these tests, I may have shared personal information with Alexa that I will not be publishing. In those cases, I will put a description of the item — like “child’s school” — in [brackets]. I have also slightly changed some of the dates, times, and numbers to further obscure any personal information that could be used to develop an understanding of my accounts, meetings, or household routines.\n\nCan Alexa+ manage the family’s schedule?\n\nBusy households, especially ones with kids, often use a family calendar to track activities, doctor’s appointments, errands, meetings, classes, and more. Our family calendar is maintained in Google Calendar, accessed on our phones through the native Google Calendar app, and on Mac desktops via the calendar app Fantastical.\n\nAmazon suggests that Alexa+ can help summarize your day, add new events to your calendar, identify conflicts, and more.\n\nIn practice, Alexa was fairly adept at letting me inquire about the schedule and various events, but she interrupted me when I was asking to add a new meeting to my calendar. I said, “Can you add a meeting to my calendar on August 6 at 2 p.m. with [entity] about—” Here she cut me off to ask, “What would you like to title this meeting?”\n\nAnnoying, but not end-of-the-world terrible, I suppose.\n\nI was more easily able to ask things like “What’s on my calendar today?” and follow up to ask further questions — like if there were any meetings later in the week or to repeat one of the appointments. I didn’t have to say “Alexa” again to continue the conversation. It felt more natural, but there’s a very slight lag with her responses at times.\n\n(As an aside, when I went to find the history of my voice chats for writing this post, I asked Alexa where they could be found. She told me to look in the app’s Settings under the More menu, then look for Alexa Privacy or Review Voice History. She’s wrong. Neither option was there. I did, however, find my history from the “Recent Chats” link on the app’s home screen. Alexa, c’mon! Know thyself.)\n\nAlexa, remember this\n\nAnother thing Alexa+ is supposed to be able to do is store information on your behalf. To test this out, I asked her to remember my frequent flier number. This interaction went poorly.\n\nMe: Alexa, can you remember my Delta SkyMiles number?\n\nAlexa: Sure, I’d be happy to remember your Delta SkyMiles number for you. What’s the number?\n\nMe: *opens mouth to speak*\n\nAlexa: I’ve added that to Remember This in the Alexa privacy section of the app. Also, keep in mind that anyone who has access to any of your Alexa devices can use their voice to hear its contents.\n\nUm, what? I tried again.\n\nMe: Alexa, can you remember my SkyMiles number?\n\nAlexa: Certainly! I’d be happy to remember your SkyMiles number for you. What’s the number? OK, saved it.\n\nShe didn’t even take a breath!\n\nCurious, I asked her what she thinks the number is. She responded, “I don’t have your SkyMiles number saved yet. Would you like to tell me your number now?”\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nAlexa: OK, go ahead and tell me your Delta SkyMiles number.\n\nMe: [says the eight-digit number]\n\nAlexa: OK, saved it.\n\nMe: What’s my SkyMiles number?\n\nAlexa: “Six hundred fifty-two million, four hundred eighty-six thousand…”\n\n(Note: I changed the number for the purpose of this post, but yes, Alexa read it out like a long numeral instead of just saying 6-5-2-4-8-6, etc. Not helpful!)\n\nAlexa, read my email\n\nAlexa+ can now supposedly understand documents you upload in the Alexa app or forward to her at alexa@alexa.com using the email address associated with your Amazon account.\n\nTo try this, I forwarded an email from my child’s school. These come frequently and have a lot of useful information in them, but are often lost in the inbox. Perhaps if Alexa can handle this task, a new Gmail forwarding filter is in order?\n\nMe: Alexa, summarize the recent email from school.\n\nAlexa: The recent email from [my child’s school] is a welcome-back letter for the 2025-2026 school year. It announces an “Early Start Day” orientation on August [date] for new students, with an information session for new parents that evening. Regular classes begin on August [date].\n\nMe: Was there any information specifically for [grade] in that email?\n\nAlexa: I don’t see any information specifically for [grade] in that email. The letter mainly covers general school information, orientation dates, and important deadlines for all students.\n\nImage Credits:Alexa app screenshot\n\nGreat, that worked, it seems. But here’s where things got a little trickier.\n\nMe: Are there any important dates I should add to my calendar?\n\nAlexa: *repeats the important dates from above*\n\nMe: Can you add those to my calendar for me?\n\nAlexa: (Which must have misheard me?) Checking your calendar. Sarah, your calendar is looking busy. You have [activity] ongoing until August 16th, you have [activity]. On Thursday—\n\nMe: (interrupting) I was asking if you could add the dates in the email to my calendar for me?\n\nAlexa: Certainly, I’ll do that. (Pause) I’ve added the following dates to your calendar:\n\nIs there anything else you’d like me to add?\n\nWhile this process seems efficient and is certainly helpful in a pinch, you’ll notice I left it up to Alexa to determine which dates were “important.” As a result, she picked the three dates closest to today. The email itself, however, contained a list of 12 important school dates, including things like Meet the Teacher Night, Open House, Midyear Graduation, and more.\n\nAll of them were formatted the same way in the email under the heading “Important Dates.” Had I only relied on Alexa and had not read the email itself, I would have missed these.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nAlexa, help me save money\n\nAnother Alexa+ promise is that she can help you track prices on Amazon so you can save money when things go on sale. All right, I’ll bite! I like online shopping.\n\nI decided to try tracking a couple of things, including one skin care item and a Coach handbag. These are things I definitely don’t need, but want — the kinds of things where a discount could prompt a purchase.\n\nAmazon.com screenshot.\n\nMe: Alexa, I want to know when the Glow Recipe Plum Plumping and Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Skin Care Serum goes on sale.\n\nAlexa: Just a second … I’ve set up a deal tracker for the Glow Recipe Plum Plumping Serum. I’ll notify you when it goes on sale.\n\nMe: How much is it right now?\n\nAlexa: *silence*\n\nMe: Did you hear me?\n\nAlexa: Checking on that. Yes, I heard you. I’ve already set up a deal tracker for the Glow Recipe Plum Plumping Serum. You’ll get a notification when it goes on sale.\n\nMe: How much is it now?\n\nAlexa: *More silence.*\n\nOK, I guess we’ll wait on that one.\n\nNext up, I tried the handbag.\n\nMe: Alexa, I want to know when the Coach Swinger handbag goes on sale.\n\nAlexa: Certainly, I’ll check that. Got it! I set up a deal tracker for the Coach Swinger handbag. I’ll let you know when it goes on sale.\n\nMe: Is it out of stock in blue?\n\nAlexa: *Silence*\n\nMe: Is the Coach handbag I just asked you about out of stock in blue? (Note: It was, per Amazon’s website at the time of the request.)\n\nAlexa: Let me check that for you. (Long pause) I found the Coach Swinger handbag, but it’s currently available in black. The blue option isn’t showing up in the search results, which might mean it’s out of stock. Would you like more details about the available options?\n\nMe: No.\n\nThe Coach Swinger handbag in blue does show up on the product page on the web, for what it’s worth; it’s listed as “temporarily out of stock.” The bag is also available in both black and red, but Alexa only mentioned the black option for some reason. Not super helpful.\n\nAnd we’ll have to wait to see if it ever goes on sale.\n\nOff to a slow start\n\nWith these first introductory tests, Alexa+ seems very much like a beta product. She’s trying but is prone to making mistakes and not being thorough. Sometimes, she doesn’t even seem to hear me or doesn’t know what to do.\n\nGiven that many of these are out-of-the-box features that don’t require integrations, you have to wonder how well Alexa+ will do at navigating the web and taking action for you.\n\nIn the next installment of this series, I’ll continue testing the AI and will try some of the agentic AI features with Alexa+.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:56:47.690471+00:00"}

This comes as Palantir admits its goal is to cut jobs—but grow revenue by 10x thanks to AI.\n\nPalantir’s stock has hit turbo mode. In the last month alone, shares surged by some 25%, helping the AI and analytics company reach a market cap north of $411 billion. And over the last year, the stock has skyrocketed by more than 550%.\n\nFor Palantir’s investors and cofounders, this surge has translated to wealth racking up by the billions.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nTTD has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors to Focus on Ahead of TTD’s Q2 Earnings\n\nIncreasing digital spending in key areas, such as Connected TV (CTV), is expected to have cushioned TTD’s topline performance in the to-be-reported quarter. In the last reported quarter, Video advertising, which includes CTV, represented a high-40s percentage share of total business. TTD is looking to capitalize on the shift from linear to programmatic CTV. TTD referred to CTV as the “kingpin of the open Internet” on the last earnings call, underscoring the company’s strategic view of CTV as a key driver of both revenues and competitive edge.\n\nIt also highlighted that supply is outpacing demand in the current ad landscape, especially in CTV, making it a buyer’s market. Major CTV players are not only “plugging directly” into TTD’s demand but also adopting key innovations like UID2 and OpenPath. This bodes well for TTD.\n\nApart from CTV, momentum in retail media, international expansion, the Kokai platform, and efforts to strengthen go-to-market capabilities are likely to have acted as tailwinds.\n\nTwo-thirds of the clients are using the company’s Kokai platform, much ahead of schedule. The platform is delivering on lower funnel KPIs, including 24% lower cost per conversion and 20% lower cost per acquisition, per TTD. Full client adoption is expected to be completed by this year. The integration of Koa AI tools was highlighted by management as a “game changer” for the Kokai platform. It introduced Deal Desk, an innovation within its Kokai platform designed to enhance how advertisers and publishers manage one-to-one deals and upfront commitments in June 2025.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:57:00.705665+00:00"}

The companies are still unprofitable for the most part as they aim to advance the technology. Cloud computing giant Amazon.com (AMZN) disclosed an investment in IonQ (IONQ), which reports earnings after the market close on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) reports early on Aug. 7. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) reports on Aug. 12, with Quantum Computing (QUBT) also due in mid-August.\n\nOn the stock market today, IonQ stock initially rose, then dipped about 2% to near 41 in morning trades. Amazon late Tuesday disclosed a $36.7 million stake in quantum computing stock IonQ, which holds an entry point of 48.94.\n\nIn Q2 financial results, investors will be focused on revenue growth for quantum computing stocks. In some cases, they will also be looking for smaller losses.\n\nIonQ Revenue Growth To Accelerate\n\nWall Street analysts expect IonQ to report a loss of 30 cents per share, widening its loss from 18 cents a year earlier. Also, IonQ revenue is expected to grow 52% to $17.3 million. In the September quarter, IonQ revenue is expected to reach $25.6 million.\n\nRosenblatt Securities in July initiated coverage on IonQ stock with a buy rating.\n\n\"We have a high level of confidence that IonQ is well positioned to take its place among the winners, and unlike some early stage competitors,\" said Rosenbatt analyst Kevin Garrigan in a report.\n\n\"IonQ will be exiting 2025 with annualized revenues in excess of $100 million, nearly doubling in 2026, and could well be on track for $1 billion in revenue over the next few years.\"\n\nWhile D-Wave turned profitable on an adjusted basis in the March quarter on a one-time revenue pop, it's expected to record a 5-cent loss in Q2, narrowing from a 10-cent loss a year earlier. D-Wave revenue is expected to grow 17% to $2.6 million. In the September quarter, D-Wave revenue will reach $3.2 million, analysts estimate.\n\nQuantum computing works on a subatomic level and uses exotic technologies, like supercold superconductor chips. Further, quantum computing aims to solve problems too complex for today's classical computers, such as simulating chemical reactions. Other applications are expected in material design.\n\nJoin IBD Live For Stock Ideas Each Morning Before The Open\n\nRigetti Expected To Post Narrower Loss\n\nD-Wave stands out as the chief developer of one flavor of quantum technology. Founded in 1999 by researchers from the University of British Columbia in Canada, the company pioneered the process called \"quantum annealing.\"\n\nFurther, Rigetti is expected to post a 5-cent loss in Q2, improving from a 7-cent loss a year earlier. But the company's revenue will dip 39% to $1.96 million, analysts predict. Rigetti's sales growth is projected to reaccelerate in the September quarter and jump in early 2026.\n\nLastly, Quantum Computing is expected to post a 6-cent loss per share, the same as a year earlier, with revenue falling 45% to $100 million. Its sales growth is expected to pick up in the September quarter.\n\nQuantum Computing Stocks Volatile In 2025\n\nMeanwhile, a basic options trading strategy around earnings — using call options — allows investors to buy a stock at a predetermined price without taking a lot of risk.\n\nThe four public quantum computing companies have raised over $2.4 billion in 2025 through various offerings, with IonQ raking in the most. IonQ has been on an acquisition spree.\n\nQuantum computing stocks have been volatile in 2025 amid a fierce debate over how fast the technology will be commercialized. Nvidia (NVDA) has offered differing views.\n\nBank of America recently forecast key advances by 2030 to 2033.\n\nIn 2025, D-Wave stock has advanced 118% as of Wednesday's market open. Shares in IonQ are flat. Shares in Rigetti have advanced about 8%.

At one point, some prominent investors argued that based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis, investors were getting the e-commerce business for free since AWS could account for the entire valuation of the stock on its own.\n\nHowever, these days, the shine may be coming off AWS. Amazon stock tumbled on its second-quarter earnings report last week, falling 8% even though it beat estimates on the top and bottom lines.\n\nInstead, the sell-off seemed to be driven by weakness in the cloud-computing unit. Revenue at AWS rose 17.5% to $30.9 billion, which was slightly better than expectations at $30.77 billion. But that growth rate was much worse than what was reported by chief rivals Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud at 39% and 32%, respectively.\n\nAlso, AWS profit margins contracted in the quarter, falling from 35.5% in the quarter a year ago to 32.9%, its lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2023, and operating income at AWS rose less than 10%, going from $9.3 billion to $10.2 billion.\n\nImprovements at the e-commerce business helped offset that weakness, but slowing growth from AWS could be a red flag for a stock that has soared to a valuation north of $2 trillion in large part because of the success of that segment, which is still the leading cloud computing business.\n\nWhy Microsoft and Google are outgrowing AWS\n\nThe biggest concern for Amazon investors right now is that while AWS remains the largest cloud infrastructure platform, its smaller rivals are growing much faster than it is, showing they may be beating it in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. For example, Azure's growth rate was more than double that of AWS in the June quarter.\n\nAlthough 17% growth isn't shabby for a business the size of AWS, given the conditions in the industry -- with AI spending surging and its rivals growing faster than 30% -- investors have to ask what happens to AWS in a weaker macroeconomic environment or if the AI boom fizzles. Given its current underperformance, it seems likely that its growth would fall to single digits or potentially turn negative.\n\nGil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, called the AWS results \"very disappointing\" and said that Azure could surpass AWS as the top cloud infrastructure business by the end of the year.\n\nOn its earnings call, Amazon noted that demand is outpacing capacity at AWS. That should be good news and could explain the slower growth. But even with that dynamic, the company saw margins compress, indicating it could be losing higher-value business to Alphabet and Microsoft, both of which have been at the forefront of the AI race while Amazon arguably got off a slow start.\n\nAmazon is stepping up its capital expenditures in the second half of the year in order to provide more capacity, and free cash flow has been negative for the first half of the year, showing that the company has already accelerated infrastructure spending to add new data centers to support cloud growth.\n\nWhat it means for Amazon\n\nThere's no single reason Amazon is losing market share in cloud computing to Google and Microsoft, a trend that has now gone on for several quarters, but there are a number of factors at play here.\n\nFirst, Amazon invented and pioneered cloud infrastructure services, and it had a seven-year head start, according to company founder Jeff Bezos. Naturally, as Amazon has shown the massive market for cloud computing, Alphabet and Microsoft have hustled to close the gap.\n\nThose two competitors also have their own advantages in the industry. Microsoft is the leading enterprise software company. And for businesses that are already using Microsoft for services from Windows to Office to Dynamics ERP, keeping your data in Azure rather than AWS might make more sense. Google Cloud, meanwhile, is a leader in AI and analytics, and it's also known for its open-source and developer-centric approach.\n\nBoth challengers have also become more price-competitive with Amazon over the years.\n\nOverall, AWS, which generated more than $10 billion in operating income in the second quarter, remains a golden goose for the company, and its relatively slow growth isn't a reason to sell Amazon stock.\n\nNonetheless, investors should pay attention to its performance over the coming quarters. If its growth slows further or the gap widens with its rivals, that could weigh further on the stock. On the other hand, based on management's statement that demand is outstripping supply, investors should expect AWS' growth to accelerate in the coming quarter as it moves through its capital expenditure cycle.\n\nThe next few quarters of results should be telling for the future of AWS. If the cloud business continues to disappoint, expect Amazon stock to head lower.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:57:15.630861+00:00"}

AWS accounted for more than half of Amazon's $19.2 billion in operating income. AWS' growth, driven partly by AI, will lead to much stronger profits thanks to the segment's higher margins.\n\nTrue, Amazon faces intense competition in cloud, but it has remained successful and benefits from switching costs within this business. Meanwhile, Amazon is also implementing AI throughout its business.\n\nThe company's fleet of more than 1 million industrial robots in its warehouses is utilizing AI to move about more efficiently. These initiatives will continue to pay off for Amazon. But there is more to the business.\n\nOne of Amazon's greatest strengths is the moat created by its brand name and the network effect of its e-commerce platform. Though e-commerce is not a particularly profitable business for the company, it has allowed it to establish its advertising business, which has been growing rapidly in recent years. E-commerce has also helped the company attract more than 200 million Amazon Prime subscribers, a large ecosystem of loyal customers that it can monetize in many different ways.\n\nSome of Amazon's newer initiatives include Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy, the latter of which has disrupted even well-established, legacy pharmacy chains. Amazon has long been looking to make waves in the healthcare field. Its current efforts look like winners and grant it yet another massive long-term growth avenue.\n\nSo, between AI, e-commerce, advertising, healthcare, Amazon's competitive edge, and an innovative culture focused on customer service, the company looks likely to perform well over the long run and deliver market-beating returns. Investors can hold this stock in their portfolios for the long term.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms makes most of its revenue from advertising, but the company has significantly improved that business thanks to AI.\n\nOn the one hand, it has used AI-powered algorithms to increase engagement on Facebook and Instagram. That automatically makes the company's ecosystem more attractive to advertisers. On the other hand, Meta Platforms introduced AI-powered tools to optimize the ad launch process, making it more productive for businesses. These initiatives are helping drive stronger results for the company.\n\nIn the second quarter, Meta Platforms' revenue increased by 22% year over year to $47.5 billion. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out that during the second quarter alone, AI-powered tools increased time spent on Facebook and Instagram by 5% and 6%, respectively. Also, thanks to AI, ad conversion grew by 3% and 5% on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMeta Platforms' other AI initiatives include its large language model, Llama, and its AI glasses developed through a partnership with Ray-Ban.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's ecosystem continues expanding. It ended the second quarter with 3.48 billion daily active users, representing a 6% increase compared to the year-ago period. Meta Platforms also benefits from a strong network effect. The company does have other long-term growth opportunities, including business messaging and its metaverse ambitions.\n\nMeta Platforms' advertising business should remain its most important for the foreseeable future, and thanks to AI, it is improving. Further, the company's extensive ecosystem of more than 3 billion daily users should enable it to identify additional growth opportunities.\n\nAll this means Meta Platforms looks like an excellent buy-and-forget stock.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:57:18.015551+00:00"}

Santa Clara-based chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices reported a record $7.7 billion in second-quarter revenue after the bell Tuesday, a 32% year-over-year increase that bested analysts’ expectations.\n\nThe company also projected third-quarter sales of $8.7 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $8.3 billion. Earnings of 48 cents per share narrowly bested the 47-cent estimate of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Yet the stock fell 5% in after-hours trading in what’s becoming a rite of chipmaker reporting days, when good is seen as not good enough.\n\nPromise and Doubt\n\nAMD entered Tuesday saddled with the expectations of a top draft pick (best of luck, Cam Ward). Analysts forecasted second-quarter revenue of $7.4 billion, or a 27% year-over-year increase, according to estimates compiled by S&P Global’s Visible Alpha. That would have matched the company’s first-quarter revenue, which represented a 36% increase as chipmakers have benefited from AI and tech giants like OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft announcing hundreds of billions in spending that will include increasing computing power.\n\nThe real hype around AMD has been its share price: Up 45% in 2025, the chipmaker’s stock is the sector’s top performer. Yep, that’s better than even Nvidia, the $4.3 trillion advanced semiconductor maker that is the world’s most valuable company; it has gained a comparatively puny 33% so far this year. But, according to John Peddie Research, mighty Nvidia captured a 92% share of the market for add-in board graphics processing units in the first quarter, up from 88% a year earlier. AMD, by comparison, lost market share, falling to 8% in the first quarter from 12% a year earlier. Lynx Equity Strategies cautioned in a note before Tuesday’s earnings that investors may be too optimistic about the role AMD’s MI350/MI355 and upcoming MI400X GPUs will play in massive chip upscaling at Meta and possibly Amazon Web Services (AWS). “We doubt if AMD has bagged share at AWS,” wrote Lynx’s KC Rajkumar, and “without AWS, AMD may be dependent on one key backer — Meta.” There’s still plenty of upside in the sector; it’s just unclear that AMD will capture it:\n\nThe Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index is up 10.6% this year, slightly better than the Nasdaq’s 8.3% advance. Optimism has been fueled in recent weeks by some $340 billion in capital spending plans for this year laid out by Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, with much of that expected to include chip-buying.\n\nBut Lynx’s KC Rajkumar warned that “investors are yet to see tangible signs of MI350/MI355 adoption at hyperscale data centers this year.” Falling profits due to more stringent curbs on chip exports and trade uncertainty also hang over earnings.\n\nNot Good Enough: It’s not just AMD. Investors have generally been hard to please for most chipmakers. Shares in UK chipmaker Arm have fallen roughly 15% since last Wednesday, even as it offered a third-quarter forecast in line with analysts’ estimates. Shares in Qualcomm, which beat analysts’ sales and profit estimates and offered a rosy forecast when it reported a day later, have since fallen 8%, with investors more worried about its exposure to the cyclical smartphone market and the forthcoming loss of Apple as its biggest modem customer.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:57:19.612982+00:00"}

It's been able to keep that status by being a humble retailer, fending off competition from the tech and artificial intelligence (AI) giants. Even Amazon (AMZN 0.08%), which controls close to 40% of e-commerce in the U.S. and has the largest cloud computing business in the world, hasn't been able to overtake it, although it's likely to in the near future.\n\nWalmart stock outperformed the market by a wide margin last year, gaining triple the S&P 500's 25% return, but its momentum is slowing in 2025. However, it's still a great buy for the value investor. If you're looking for a top value stock to buy today, here are three reasons why Walmart is an excellent candidate.\n\n1. E-commerce is on the rise\n\nAmazon may be the leader of e-commerce, but Walmart knows where its strengths lie. It's all-in on leveraging its edge, and Amazon's weakness, to grow its e-commerce presence.\n\nAlthough Walmart only accounts for 6% to 7% of U.S. e-commerce sales, well below Amazon's share, Walmart is growing a lot faster these days. In the 2026 fiscal first quarter (ended April 30), U.S. e-commerce sales increased 22% year over year. Amazon's online stores sales and third-party sellers sales both increased 11% year over year in the second quarter, up from 5% and 6% respectively in Q1.\n\nWalmart has about 4,600 retail stores in the U.S. -- more than double the number of rival Target, almost triple the number of premium grocer Kroger, and quadruple the number of Costco Wholesale. These stores are built-in distribution centers, and Walmart is using them as last-mile delivery hubs to get orders out faster and cheaper, since it has many of the products customers order on hand at all times. It already has a powerful distribution model for getting products into these stores, making it efficient to use them for e-commerce as well.\n\nAnother way Walmart is leveraging its store count is for pickup. There's a Walmart or Sam's Club store within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population, and people who don't want to wait for an order have an easy time picking it up at their local Walmart. In the first quarter, deliveries in under three hours increased 91% year over year.\n\nThis is a model Amazon can't replicate. Amazon has tried to develop some kind of physical presence for years, with mixed results. This is where Walmart dominates. While this may not ever make Walmart No. 1 in U.S. e-commerce, it should ensure the company's growth and ability to stay in a steady second place for the foreseeable future.\n\n2. It's unbeatable in retail\n\nE-commerce still represents a small percentage of Walmart's total sales, about 13% in Q1. Its total sales were $166 billion in the quarter, and they continue to increase, up 2.5% year over year. There is no other retailer that can come close to that, even when you include e-commerce. Amazon may overtake Walmart soon as the largest company, since it hit $167 billion in sales in the second quarter, but only about $100 million of that came from retail.\n\nWalmart management continues to raise the bar for what it offers, renovating stores, making them more efficient, and changing the product assortment to meet different demand. The company is also finding new ways to boost engagement and revenue, such as its membership program and its advertising business. Membership grew 10% over last year in Q1, and membership fee income was up 15%.\n\nWalmart also got investor approval for being resistant to tariffs, since much of its merchandise is made in the U.S., and leverage with suppliers means it can change packaging and production to come in even lower on cost. Finally, despite its size, the company also sees further opportunity to open new stores, and it opened 212 new stores in Q1.\n\n3. It's a Dividend King\n\nValue investors love a great dividend stock, and Walmart fits the bill. It doesn't have a high yield, only 0.9% at the current price, but it's growing, and it's reliable. Walmart is a Dividend King, which means the company has raised its dividend for at least 50 years. Walmart recently joined the club, and it raised the dividend for the 52nd straight year in March.\n\nWalmart stock still packs a strong punch, and if you're looking for a stable and powerful value stock, Walmart could be an excellent addition to your portfolio.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:57:23.259537+00:00"}

This is a dominant retailer that has done a wonderful job taking care of its investors historically. In the past 20 years, shares have generated a total return of 3,060% (as of Aug. 4) -- an unbelievable gain.\n\nCostco's early shareholders who held on to their shares have certainly gotten wealthy. Investors who are interested in the company today must have a fresh perspective, though, and view the current situation with clear eyes. Could buying this top retail stock today set you up for life?\n\nCostco is a high-quality business\n\nI believe that every investor should at least have Costco on their watch list because it's a great company. Here are some key reasons why.\n\nFor starters, Costco has a wide economic moat that stems from its cost advantage. The company's warehouses carry about 4,000 stock-keeping units, much less than the tens of thousands that a typical supermarket sells. But Costco is the world's third largest retailer. Therefore, it's selling a massive quantity of a limited number of goods.\n\nThis gives the company tremendous buying power over its suppliers, which results in favorable costs. Consumers benefit the most, as they can shop for quality merchandise at low prices. More revenue will further bolster Costco's cost advantage in a positive feedback loop.\n\nIf Costco operated with a simple business model of selling goods at the lowest prices around, it wouldn't necessarily be unique in the retail industry. But the company runs a membership program, so only those households that pay an annual fee are allowed to shop at its warehouses. As of May 11, there were 79.6 million membership households with a 90.2% worldwide renewal rate. This drives customer loyalty.\n\nCompared to other big-box retailers, Costco marks up the price of its inventory at a much lower rate. However, it's able to do this because it makes money from memberships. In Q3, membership income totaled more than $1.2 billion, up 10.4% year over year. This is surely a high-margin revenue source.\n\nCostco's staying power\n\nDurability is another reason this is a high-quality company. These days, technology is a disruptive force that's basically hitting all industries in some way, and the retail sector hasn't been spared. Just look at the rise of online shopping, which today commands about 16.2% of the entire U.S. retail market. Just 10 years ago, this share was 6.9%.\n\nOf course, Amazon deserves credit for propelling this trend. It has definitely won over consumers, thanks to its popular Prime membership program. However, Costco has still been very successful, as its consistent revenue and earnings growth demonstrate.\n\nShoppers still love the in-person experience. This gives me confidence that Costco will still be relevant decades from now.\n\nExpectations have outpaced reality\n\nIt's quite shocking to see a retailer put up such phenomenal investment gains that has continued in recent times. Just in the past five years, Costco shares have produced a total return of 214%. This figure is supported by not only regular dividends, but special one-time payouts.\n\nThe stock has done well, but I believe the valuation has gotten stretched. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 54.2. Investors have bid up the shares to the point where expectations have outpaced reality.\n\nThe valuation implies rapid profit growth in the years ahead. That's not going to happen, as this is a mature company.\n\nTo be fair, Costco continues to open new warehouses, which will certainly lead to revenue and earnings gains. However, I wouldn't be surprised if the stock lags the overall market over the next decade. Buying Costco shares today won't set you up for life.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:57:24.823037+00:00"}

CRI sells its products through leading department stores, national chains, and specialty retailers, both domestically and internationally. The company sells through retail partners like Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and Macy’s (M).\n\nDeclining Birthrate is a Long-term Headwind for Carter’s\n\nThe US birthrate has been declining consistently for the past seven decades. However, as economic conditions, social, and cultural winds shift, the birthrate in the United States has shrunk even further. Meanwhile, widespread access to contraception has also weighed on the birthrate. Because Carter’s is focused on the baby segment, this is a troubling long-term headwind with no end in sight for CRI investors.\n\nCRI Suffers Amid Weak Consumer Trends, Suspends Guidance\n\nCarter’s, like others in the industry, has been witnessing the impacts of a challenging macroeconomic environment, which is affecting its top-line performance. In addition, the current tariff environment has introduced significant uncertainty, making it difficult to predict the company’s future financial performance. As a result, Carter’s has decided to suspend providing guidance until there is more clarity on the internal operational direction and external market conditions. The company also cited a highly volatile retail landscape, ongoing macroeconomic pressures, and foreign currency headwinds, particularly in its international markets, as added factors contributing to the lack of forward visibility. Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that EPS growth will continue to plunge into 2026.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDriven by the continuation of these trends, Carter’s first-quarter 2025 sales declined 4.8% from $661.5 million posted in the year-ago period. The decline was due to macroeconomic pressures, including inflation, elevated interest rates, and weakening consumer confidence, which reduced demand across segments.

These rising tariffs, particularly on products manufactured in Asia, are impacting cost structures, especially given that less than 5% of baby apparel is produced in the Western Hemisphere. While the company has actively engaged in lobbying efforts and evaluated nearshoring alternatives in Latin America, high labor costs and limited infrastructure in the region make it challenging to offset the tariff burden effectively.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:57:26.667023+00:00"}

The median target price of $276 per share implies 15% upside from the current share price of $239.\n\nMost Wall Street analysts think Amazon is the best trillion-dollar stock to buy right now. Here's what investors should know.\n\nAmazon stock has declined 10% since the company reported second-quarter results\n\nAmazon reported second-quarter financial results that crushed estimates on the top and bottom lines. Sales increased 13% to $168 billion on particularly strong revenue growth in the advertising segment, coupled with solid momentum in the retail and cloud segments. Operating margin expanded 150 basis points, and GAAP earnings increased 34% to $1.68 per diluted share.\n\nManagement provided the following third-quarter guidance: Revenue will increase 11% to $177 billion, and operating income will increase 3% to $18 billion. Investors were disappointed by the weak earnings forecast. That, coupled with somewhat underwhelming growth in cloud computing sales, has caused the stock to drop 10% since the company reported its second-quarter financial results.\n\nI think the market got this wrong. Amazon's cloud sales may have increased more slowly than Microsoft's and Alphabet's, but its sales growth is also measured on a much larger base. Amazon accounted for 30% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending in the second quarter, while Microsoft and Alphabet accounted for 20% and 13%, respectively.\n\nAlso, Amazon gave somewhat disappointing guidance for operating income, but caution is warranted given the tariff landscape. Moreover, the same thing happened last quarter and the company beat expectations. Not surprisingly, Wall Street remains broadly optimistic. More than a dozen analysts revised their target prices higher after the second-quarter report.\n\nAmazon is ideally positioned to benefit from artificial intelligence in retail and cloud computing\n\nThe investment thesis for Amazon centers on its strong presence in three large industries. It runs the largest e-commerce marketplace worldwide by revenue, and the most popular by web traffic. It is the third largest ad tech company in the world by revenue, and the leader in the retail advertising segment. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud by infrastructure and platform services spending.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak earlier this year called Amazon an underappreciated leader in generative artificial intelligence (AI) across its retail and cloud businesses. Details are provided below:\n\nRetail: Amazon has developed more than 1,000 generative AI applications to make its retail operations more efficient, including systems that optimize inventory placement, demand forecasting, and last-mile delivery. The company has also developed an AI model that lets robots navigate warehouses faster, and it's building an AI model that will let workers engage robots conversationally. Finally, Amazon is preparing to test humanoid robots for package delivery.\n\nAmazon has developed more than 1,000 generative AI applications to make its retail operations more efficient, including systems that optimize inventory placement, demand forecasting, and last-mile delivery. The company has also developed an AI model that lets robots navigate warehouses faster, and it's building an AI model that will let workers engage robots conversationally. Finally, Amazon is preparing to test humanoid robots for package delivery. Cloud: AWS has designed custom chips for AI training and inference that offer better price performance than the current generation of GPUs, according to management. It has also introduced a generative AI development platform called Bedrock, and more recently added tools that help clients build and scale AI agents. AWS is also the primary cloud provider for Anthropic, which could lead to an acceleration in cloud revenue in the coming quarters because the AI start-up is growing rapidly.\n\nImportantly, Amazon has an opportunity to monetize artificial intelligence beyond its core retail and cloud businesses. Its subsidiary Zoox is building robotaxis, and the company will launch its first autonomous ride-hailing service in Las Vegas this year, followed other cities shortly thereafter. Morgan Stanley estimates Zoox could have commercial robotaxi services in seven U.S. cities by 2028.\n\nAmazon has consistently exceeded Wall Street's expectations\n\nWall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 10% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 32 times earnings look somewhat expensive. But analysts have consistently underestimated the company.

This is the first time that OpenAI models will be offered by AWS, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. They will be available as a model choice with Amazon AI services Bedrock and SageMaker AI.\n\nWhile anyone can download the models via Hugging Face, Amazon is offering these models with OpenAI’s full knowledge and approval, as Dmitry Pimenov, the model maker’s product lead, indicated in the announcement. A spokesperson described the offering as similar to how Amazon offered open model DeepSeek-R1 earlier this year.\n\nThis is a juicy competitive move for both companies. For AWS, it finally puts the cloud giant in the same sentence as the biggest model maker, OpenAI.\n\nUntil now, AWS has best been known as a major host and a financial backer of Anthropic’s Claude, one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors. AWS offers Claude, along with other models from makers such as Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, and Mistral, as well as its own home-grown ones in its AI services. Specifically, Bedrock allows AWS customers to build and host generative AI apps using models of their choice. SageMaker, on the other hand, allows AWS customers to train, or even build, their own AI models largely for analytics uses.\n\nWhile AWS’s ultimate rival, Microsoft, hasn’t had a lock on OpenAI models since January, Azure is still OpenAI’s most significant cloud partner to date. OpenAI even announced that Microsoft is offering versions of these two new models, too, optimized for Windows devices.\n\nWatching Microsoft win an increasing amount of cloud business with OpenAI has been a public pain in Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s neck. Just last week during Amazon’s quarterly earnings call, Jassy was pounded with questions from Wall Street analysts about how the company was losing ground in AI to competitors, particularly Microsoft.\n\nFor instance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked Jassy to explain “significantly faster cloud growth among the number two and number three players in the space,” referring to Microsoft and Google. Later, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak told Jassy that Wall Street thinks “AWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss, peers, etc.”\n\nJassy responded with a minutes-long diatribe that included this barb at Redmond: “I think the second player is about 65% of the size of the AWS.”\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, another AWS competitor, Oracle, reported that it signed a $30 billion a year deal with OpenAI to offer data center services. This means that OpenAI plans to pay Oracle more each year than all of its other cloud services customers combined. Until now, AWS had been left out of any OpenAI-related glory.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:57:33.844735+00:00"}

Supply chain hiccups, interest rate pressures, and intense global competition have seen many EV stocks tumbling from their peaks. But for investors with a long-term perspective, August is offering up some pretty compelling opportunities to pick up some popular names at reasonable valuations.\n\nTwo in particular stand out right now: Nio (NIO -8.96%) and Rivian Automotive (RIVN 0.21%). Each faces its own headwinds but also carries a credible growth story and the potential to reward investors who can wait.\n\nNio\n\nNio is China's premium EV daredevil. While most EV makers want to sell you a car, Nio wants to refuel it for you, too. Its battery-swap stations let drivers trade a drained pack for a full one in less time than it takes to grab a latte. In an industry that obsesses over range, that kind of convenience is tough to ignore.\n\nNio's current share price, less than $5, plants its market cap around $10 billion, valuing the company at about 1.06 times sales (for perspective, Tesla's figure is about 11.5). That's pretty cheap for a premium EV brand with real market share in China, the world's largest EV market. Its revenue has grown steadily, reaching about $9.4 billion over the past 12 months.\n\nThe problem is that growth hasn't yet translated into profitability. Nio lost roughly $3.3 billion last year, and gross margins remain stubbornly in the mid single digits. Meanwhile, the Chinese EV market is cutthroat, with rivals Tesla and BYD dominating volume.\n\nThat forces Nio into a tricky balance: trying to protect its brand as a premium choice while staying competitive on cost. So far that has meant operating losses and persistent cash burn, with over $13 billion in total liabilities and just $2 billion in equity.\n\nNio has expanded into Europe, which is exciting, but that comes with its own problem: Wherever Nio goes, it needs to build out its network of battery swapping stations. That intrinsic problem means that expansion into new markets, though potentially beneficial for top-line growth, also comes with operating expenses that will affect its profitability.\n\nStill, last Thursday's 8% rally -- sparked by a blowout launch for its mass-market Onvo L90 SUV -- was a reminder of how quickly sentiment can turn. The first 10,000-unit batch reportedly sold out in just three hours. Management is aiming for adjusted profitability by late 2025 and plans to expand margins and build out its infrastructure moat in battery swaps and autonomous tech. For investors who believe in a future of EVs, today's sub-$5 price could be the low point before a long climb.\n\nRivian\n\nRivian makes electric trucks, SUVs, and delivery vans. Think rugged designs, off-road capability, and outdoorsy brand vibe. On top of that, it has a key partnership with Amazon, which is rolling out Rivian-built electric delivery vans (currently, about 25,000 of these bad boys are on the road). While originally, Amazon had exclusive rights to Rivian, both parties have since amended the contract, allowing Rivian to sell its vans to other companies.\n\nThe near term hasn't been super smooth. In the second quarter, deliveries dropped about 22% year over year to 10,661 vehicles.\n\nWhile that number might seem concerning at first glance, the slowdown may be strategic: Rivian wants to bring its lower-priced R2 SUV to market in 2026, aiming to tap a much larger customer base. The timing also lines up with a fresh $1 billion investment from Volkswagen, which will help develop new EV platforms and software.\n\nFinancially, Rivian is improving but still in the red. It posted a modest gross profit in the first quarter, its second in a row, and revenue edged higher year over year to $1.24 billion.\n\nLosses remain heavy, with negative free cash flow of about $526 million in the quarter. Still, its $4.7 billion cash pile and Volkswagen's funding should give it some breathing room while it works toward profitability.\n\nAt today's share price (about $12 to $13), Rivian's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is about 2.6, far lower than Tesla's. At the same time, if it can nail the R2 launch, keep Amazon vans rolling, and tighten up its cost structure, sentiment could swing fast in the right direction. But there are still a lot of unknowns, and prospective investors should definitely expect a bumpy road before it starts to smooth out.\n\nWhy these EV stocks deserve a look\n\nThe EV market will test your patience, but that's part of the deal. Nio and Rivian each have something real going for them, whether its Nio's surge of demand or Rivian's steady Amazon van pipeline.\n\nBoth are still finding their financial footing, yet their current prices leave plenty of room for increases. If they can deliver on the next leg of growth, today's buyers could be glad they stayed buckled up.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:57:40.091095+00:00"}

OKLO is rethinking how nuclear energy is produced, and at the center of its strategy is fuel recycling. Unlike conventional reactors that only use about 5% of the energy content from nuclear fuel, Oklo’s special ‘fast reactors’ are built to tap into the other 95% that's normally thrown away. That means the company can take what’s typically considered dangerous nuclear waste and transform it into a valuable source of clean, reliable energy. It’s a clever solution that solves a big waste problem while powering homes and businesses.\n\n\n\nOklo's approach gives it a major advantage. By building its own fuel supply chain and developing its own recycling technology, the company hopes to keep long-term costs down and stay ahead of rivals. The U.S. Department of Energy appears confident in this direction, selecting Oklo for four recycling-related projects totaling over $15 million. These initiatives aim to advance waste-to-energy technologies that could underpin the company’s long-term fuel strategy and drive meaningful innovation in the sector.\n\n\n\nThe implications are striking. According to Oklo, all the used nuclear fuel already stored in the United States contains enough energy to power the country for over 150 years. By tapping into this dormant supply, Oklo is not only starting a new kind of power plant but also completely redefining the future of nuclear energy.\n\nBreaking Down the Fuel Strategies of Nuclear Rivals\n\nEntergy Corporation ETR is advancing its exploration of next-generation nuclear technologies to further reduce emissions. Entergy has secured a permit in Mississippi for a potential new reactor site and is trying to engage with industrial clients and technology firms, particularly those in the AI and data sectors, on potential partnerships for deploying small modular reactors (SMRs). Entergy’s collaborations are aimed at jointly addressing the financial and regulatory challenges of next-gen nuclear projects.\n\n\n\nDominion Energy D is also actively investing in the future of nuclear energy, particularly through the exploration of Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. In October 2024, Dominion signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Amazon to assess the feasibility of deploying SMRs at its North Anna facility in Virginia.

I do. Investors aren't accustomed to seeing Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) struggle. That's why Amazon stock fell more than 8% on Friday following Thursday's post-close release of its second-quarter numbers, which included disappointing earnings guidance hinting at headwinds on the artificial intelligence front.\n\nWhat if, however, the market's misreading the matter?\n\nI contend this is the case, which makes the stock's recent setback a fantastic buying opportunity. Here's the deal.\n\n(Some of) the numbers suggest Amazon is falling behind in AI\n\nFor any investors who've not yet heard (or as a refresher for those who have), for the three-month stretch ending in June Amazon turned $167.7 billion worth of revenue into a per-share profit of $1.68. That's well up from the year-ago comparisons of $148 billion and $1.26 per share, and better than analysts' estimates for a top line of $162.2 billion and per-share bottom line of $1.33. Its cloud computing arm did well too. Amazon Web Services' revenue grew 17% to $60.1 billion, $21.7 billon of which became operating income.\n\nAmazon's cloud business's growth pace, however, was also a key reason for Friday's stumble. It trailed the cloud computing growth reported by Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) for the same three-month stretch. Microsoft's cloud business grew 26% year over year last quarter, while Google Cloud's sales were up nearly 32% in Q2. Investors panicked, interpreting this stark difference in growth rates as a sign that Amazon is falling behind its AI competitors.\n\nThe wording of CEO Andy Jassy's thoughts on the current status of Amazon Web Services (AWS) made during the quarterly earnings conference call didn't help. Specifically, investors read doubt into his comment \"We could be doing more revenue and helping customers more, and we are working very hard on changing that outcome and how much capacity we have.\"\n\nAnd Q3's guidance only stoked these worries. Although companywide revenue for the quarter now underway should roll in between $174 billion and $179.5 billion versus analysts' consensus estimate of $173.1 billion, Amazon's Q3 operating income is only apt to be somewhere between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion. That doesn't compare favorably to FactSet's consensus expectation of $19.5 billion. Amazon stock tanked as a result.\n\nInvestors are seeing things all wrong, though.\n\nThe rest of the story\n\nNo, Amazon's cloud business didn't grow nearly as fast as Google's or Microsoft's did during the second quarter of this year.\n\nThere's an important detail, however, being left out of the discussion. That's the fact that AWS is more than twice as big as either of the two top rivals. In fact, data compiled by Synergy Research Group indicates that with its 30% share of the global cloud market's total revenue, Amazon's cloud business is 50% bigger than next-nearest Microsoft. And while Microsoft's total Q2 cloud revenue improved year over year, it's been losing market share since early last year. Amazon's share at least ticked a little higher last quarter.\n\nThe bigger \"so what?\" is the mathematics of the matter. While Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft may have produced more relative growth with their respective cloud businesses than Amazon did, it's mathematically easier to grow from a smaller comparison than a larger one. On an absolute dollar basis, AWS technically did outgrow its rivals.\n\nLet's also not look past Synergy's data reminding us that AWS is still the planet's single-biggest cloud business. There's a reason it's been able to hold on to this lead.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, several analysts made the same observation following Thursday's release of Amazon's second-quarter numbers. Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt noted, \"While we understand the reaction in shares after-hours, we do not believe the company's longer-term opportunity is impaired, and our thesis remains intact.\" Meanwhile, although RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson concedes, \"this was an uncharacteristic setback quarter that will take some time to recover from,\" adding \"we believe in the company being able to maintain, if not accelerate, AWS growth over time, which should help restore investor faith in capitalizing on the AI opportunity.\"\n\nThere's good reason for this optimism too. During the call Jassy touted the company's relatively new AI-agent technology as well as its recently launched AI-powered virtual digital assistant Alexa+, which is also an advertising platform. These solutions don't suggest Amazon is actually falling behind in AI. Indeed, as CFO Brian Olsavsky pointed out in his discussion of the quarterly results, Amazon's cloud backlog now stands at a hefty $195 billion, up 25% from year-earlier levels.\n\nAWS' chief challenge right now? Mostly just a lack of access to the amount of electricity that data centers need.\n\nEven then, however, the company's helping itself. For instance, last year it began offering data center customers access to Arm Holdings' Graviton4 processor, which consumes up to 60% less power than comparable alternative processors.\n\nWorth it, if you can stomach it\n\nNone of this guarantees Amazon shares will be easy to own in the immediate future, of course. Echoing a sentiment from RBC's Brad Erickson, Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt believes \"in the coming quarters, we expect concerns around the intermediate-term trajectory of AWS growth rate and margin could remain an overhang on shares as investors contemplate the rising perception of AWS as a laggard in the AI space.\"\n\nIn other words, newcomers could be in for a bumpy, sometimes-scary ride for a while.\n\nBut as the old adage goes, fortune favors the bold.\n\nThis might help bolster your confidence: While Amazon's Q3 profit guidance of $18.5 billion (at the midpoint of its suggested range) may have been shy of analysts' expectations, that's still above last year's third-quarter operating income of $17.4 billion. It's also a pretty safe bet that Amazon is being purposely conservative with its profit outlook, as it has by an average of about $2 billion per quarter for the past several quarters. Investors are just too distracted by the noisy headlines to remember.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:57:55.141628+00:00"}

Stress on the grid is sending Americans' electricity bills higher , and the US is losing ground to foreign competitors looking to host the new generation of computing hubs that hold and process data generated by some of the most powerful companies in the world.\n\nClosing that gap, according to eight different analysts, researchers, and energy traders who spoke with Yahoo Finance, will require a long lead time, an intensive amount of new energy infrastructure development, and an enormous amount of capital.\n\nIn some of the country's most important markets, this \"misalignment of expectations\" could equal a lag of at least one to two years, if not longer, before the power that data center developers are seeking is actually available, according to a July report by clean energy fuel cell provider Bloom Energy ( BE ).\n\nBut America's tech industry may be overestimating just how much pressure the power grid can take — and how quickly the nation's utilities will actually be able to meet the rampant demand. Aging infrastructure well beyond its useful life, decades of stagnant industrial investment, and years-long delays in getting new power connected to the grid may put a wrench in Big Tech's plans.\n\n\"The large data center developers and their hyperscaler customers want power right away,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of electricity infrastructure consulting firm Grid Strategies.\n\nIn turn, US electricity demand has exploded and is projected to grow five times faster over the next 10 years than it did in the previous decade, according to research from Bank of America ( BAC ). And these companies are showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe world's largest tech companies are waging a power-driven arms race to be at the forefront of the computing and AI technology wave. These so-called hyperscalers — including tech giants like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOG ), and Oracle ( ORCL ) — have poured money into pushing artificial intelligence development and computing ability ever further.\n\nFor more than a decade, the demand for power across the US has been nearly stagnant, growing by less than 1% per year. Then came the data center revolution.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDunne's company stands to benefit.\n\nPower play\n\nAcross the globe, a web of thousands of data centers is springing up, from “Data Center Alley” in Loudoun County, Va., to Richland Parish in the northeastern corner of rural Louisiana and Kolkata, India, and it forms the backbone of the AI and cloud-computing industries.\n\nGlobal power usage by data centers is expected to grow from a current level of around 55 gigawatts to 84 gigawatts — equivalent to the power usage of roughly 70 million homes — in only the next two years, according to research from Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnd the biggest names in tech are only increasing their plans for more.\n\nIn December, Meta (META) announced plans to spend $10 billion building the largest data center hub in the Western Hemisphere, 250 miles north of New Orleans. The site, which Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg has said will be bigger than the island of Manhattan, is expected to come online in 2030.\n\nThis year, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta alone are expected to spend $364 billion in capital expenditures, much of it going toward AI technology development.\n\nBut the increasing demand from data centers that each require a power draw equivalent to thousands of homes is running up against an aging and largely stagnant North American grid, threatening stability.\n\n\"The size and speed at which large data centers, typically developed to support the computing needs for AI and cryptocurrency mining, are expanding across the country\" represents a \"significant near-term reliability challenge,\" according to research from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a nonprofit deputized by the federal government to regulate the power grid.\n\nTo understand the problem, you have to understand how the grid works. At a basic level, electricity follows a roughly three-step process to reach a home, a data center, or any other endpoint.\n\nA power source, such as the Linden Cogeneration Plant that lights up the night sky outside New York City or the soaring towers of Georgia's nuclear Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, generates energy. That energy is then transmitted across power lines that crisscross the country. Once it reaches its destination, the electricity is distributed to the tangle of smaller lines that many Americans see running through their communities and that carry it to its final destination.\n\nThe generation sources, such as coal plants and solar farms, determine capacity, or how much power is actually available for use. And the market is already capacity-constrained.\n\n\"We've grown accustomed to several decades of pretty slow demand growth in the electric sector, and the last few years have really turned that on its head,\" Brendan Pierpont, the director of electric modeling at the research organization Electric Innovation, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe gap has already begun to push tech developers to look abroad. While the US still claims the dominant share of data center power markets globally, the rest of the world is gaining ground. The Asia Pacific region has seen the lion's share of added power supply over the last decade, according to Goldman Sachs research. Beijing is now the world's second-largest market for hyperscaler power capacity, only behind the US's northern Virginia region, according to reports from Synergy Research Group.\n\nTo be sure, North America is projected to have the largest amount of new power coming online in the next five years out of any global region. But fresh development takes a long time.\n\nOn the shorter end of the spectrum, Goldman Sachs utilities analyst Carly Davenport told Yahoo Finance, a company like NextEra could likely bring a solar or wind facility into service within 18 to 24 months. But if the goal is to bring on serious capacity through a project at the scale of a gas plant, where new builds on average have added four times the capacity of a new solar build, or a much larger capacity nuclear power plant, the timeline is much longer. In the meantime, hyperscalers may have to find other answers.\n\n\"If you are deciding today that you want to build new gas, you likely will not be able to take delivery of a turbine until 2029,\" Davenport said. \"If you're wanting to build new nuclear, that's something that we think is more [of] a mid-2030s type event to actually get that online.\"\n\nAnd once a new generation resource is built, it often has to sit in a years-long queue just to get connected to the grid. At PJM Interconnection, the grid operator of the largest power market in the US, the process to get grid-connected takes five years on average, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nOnly around a fifth of the generation projects that requested grid connection between 2000 and 2018 were in commercial operation by 2023, the Laboratory found.\n\nEnough to keep the hyperscalers happy?

Photo by Kena Betancur/VIEWpress) · VIEW press via Getty Images\n\nThe $800 billion push\n\nWork on the infrastructure that brings power from source to destination — the transformers and power lines running throughout the country — has also remained largely stagnant.\n\nThirty-one percent of transmission equipment and 46% of distribution equipment in the US are within five years of the end of their useful life or have already passed that point, according to research from Bank of America. Across the country's electric utilities, which deliver energy to customers and maintain the infrastructure required to do so, two-thirds of 2024 spending went toward replacing existing infrastructure, the bank found.\n\nAnd the pace of new grid development has been slowing down.\n\nThe US built an average of 1,700 miles of transmission infrastructure per year through the first half of the 2010s, but the back half of the decade saw only 645 miles built on average per year, according to Grid Strategies.\n\nTo be sure, data centers are also not the only things pulling on the grid. Electrification mandates, electric vehicle development, and other power-hungry technologies like cryptocurrency mining all continue to exert pressure on a strained grid.\n\n\"I think what's happening is sort of refocusing to people, 'Hey, we have these assets that are now approaching 30 to 40 years [of operation], and not only do you need to replace them, you need to upgrade them,\" Bank of America industrials analyst Andrew Obin told Yahoo Finance. \"If you run the grid without real money for 20 years, things start to break.\"\n\nIn response, the utilities industry is not sitting still.\n\nGE Vernova (GEV), which supplies equipment to customers including AI and cloud-computing data center developers, utilities companies, and industrial-scale power projects, saw its orders for power-related equipment increase by more than 40% in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024, according to the company's latest earnings report. The company has received $500 million in orders specifically for data center electrification this year, compared to $600 million throughout all of 2024, CEO Scott Strazik said on the earnings call.\n\nBut meeting the growing need will require an immense amount of both capital and labor.\n\nUtilities are now expected to spend $800 billion over the next five years, compared to only $550 billion spent between 2020 and 2024, Goldman Sachs' Davenport told Yahoo Finance, and the US is projected to need to add more than 500,000 jobs by 2030 in the electric sector.\n\nMarket stress\n\nEach year, PJM holds a capacity auction to determine the lowest pay-rate energy producers are willing to accept from the grid operator to guarantee that they will be ready to provide power at any time during the delivery period covered by the auction, usually several years out.\n\nIn this summer's auction, generators offered an additional 2,669 megawatts of power supplies to be added through infrastructure upgrades and new builds.\n\nIt was the first time in the past four auctions that new capacity was added. But the additions only meet around half of the demand PJM is expecting to see over the coming three years. That impact will show up in Americans' electricity bills.\n\nIn PJM's 2024 auction, the utility's clearing price — the end price that determines what it has to pay all participating power generators — was $269.92 per megawatt-day, an 800% increase from the previous year.\n\nThat December, after utilities companies warned customers in PJM-covered Pennsylvania that monthly bill prices could increase by $15, Governor Josh Shapiro filed a lawsuit against PJM, claiming the grid operator's poor processing capabilities had harmed customers and created \"potentially the largest unjust wealth transfer in the history of U.S. energy markets.\"\n\nIn response, PJM filed a proposal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to create a price collar for the coming auctions that was accepted and put into effect.\n\nThis year's auction saw prices clear levels more than 20% higher, at $329.17 per MW-day, which is the price cap established by the PJM proposal. This is expected to raise consumers' electric bills in PJM's coverage area — 13 states across the mideast region of the country plus Washington, D.C. — by 1.5%-5%, on average, according to the operator.\n\nThis effect is not constrained to only the country's biggest or fastest-growing markets.\n\nIf a developer cannot find power in one market or is unwilling to accept proposed timelines, several experts told Yahoo Finance, it will go elsewhere until it finds a market that suits its needs.\n\n\"The stress on every grid from increased electricity demand doled out by data center clusters is noticeable,\" Brad Jones, managing partner of power-trading specialist hedge fund Standard Normal, told Yahoo Finance. \"We are really and truly seeing it everywhere.\"\n\nAaron Tinjum, the vice president of energy at the Data Center Coalition trade association, which counts Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Oracle as members, told Yahoo Finance that while the industry has largely tried to \"right-size infrastructure and minimize any unnecessary costs, the data center industry has also experienced the acute impacts of under-forecasting and insufficient communication\" that have created \"multi-year project delays in key data center markets.\"\n\n\"While we recognize that grid planning and management is ultimately the role of utilities, grid operators, and regulators, the data center industry has been actively leaning in as a committed and engaged partner across the country to help advance and accelerate grid modernization and energy infrastructure to support American economic competitiveness and national security,\" Tinjum said.\n\nOver the long term, US capacity is largely expected to meet demand, Davenport told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe NERC has projected that several hundred gigawatts of capacity from new generation are expected to arrive within the decade.\n\nBut in the meantime, the gap between supply and demand has pushed the biggest tech players to search for other solutions.\n\nIn March 2024, Amazon Web Services announced a deal worth $650 million with power producer and energy infrastructure operator Talen Energy (TLN). In return for that sum, Talen is set to provide Amazon with more than 1.9 gigawatts of energy from its Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, one of the largest nuclear plants in the country, to power a data center site directly adjacent to the plant.\n\nThen in September 2024, Microsoft inked a deal with Constellation Energy (CEG) to purchase power that Constellation plans to generate by bringing one of two reactors at the decommissioned Three Mile Island nuclear plant back online by 2028.\n\nElectricity Innovation's Pierpont told Yahoo Finance that he expects hyperscalers and other large tech players to increasingly pursue deals like Amazon's and Microsoft's as they look at how much power they can generate themselves on-site — especially as data center development shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nAlphabet recently announced on its Q2 earnings call that data centers and networking equipment made up a full third of its $22.4 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, while Microsoft said it will spend $80 billion by the end of the year to \"build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.\"\n\n\"Helping accelerate growth while also making sure we pay our fair share for the electricity to serve our operations is critical for Google,\" Alphabet said in a statement provided to Yahoo Finance. \"Our priority is to help responsibly scale grid systems, making them more reliable, resilient and affordable for everyone.\"\n\nAmazon implied on its Q4 2024 earnings call that it will spend around $63 billion on capex in the second half of 2025, and Oracle predicted in its Q4 earnings call that the \"vast majority\" of its projected $25 billion-plus in capex will be spent on \"equipment that is going into data centers and not for land or buildings.\"\n\n“We work closely with utilities and grid operators to plan for future growth,\" Amazon said in a statement. \"Where we require specific infrastructure to meet our needs (such as new substations), we work to make sure that we’re covering those costs and that they aren’t being passed on to other ratepayers.\"\n\nTech players have begun to announce initiatives to ease some of the burden of their grid draw. Google recently signed agreements with two US utilities to operate a \"demand response\" model for its data centers that can \"shift or reduce\" power during peak demand times, which the company said will help to get new developments grid-connected more quickly, reduce the need for new capacity, and make it easier for operators to better manage power grids.\n\nBut activist groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) say they haven't seen the tech players live up to their claims.\n\n\"As state regulators respond to growing demand, the data center industry has demonstrated a lack of transparency about their energy use and an unwillingness to aggressively push for state and federal policy that would unlock barriers to the clean energy and transmission infrastructure needed to meet their stated goals,\" SELC climate initiative leader Alys Campaigne told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSELC has threatened Elon Musk's xAI with lawsuits over its Colossus data center project in Memphis that activists say involved installing gas turbines without proper permitting. SELC has also worked with other activist groups to block data center developments.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta, and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPower hungry: Construction at an Amazon Web Services data center on Aug. 22, 2024, in Boardman, Ore. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane) · ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFor its part, the energy industry is likely to push back plans to retire existing gas and coal plants that can provide steady capacity, even if they are at or near the point of decommissioning, Goldman Sachs' Davenport and Bank of America's Obin told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"You could push those [retirement timelines] out and to the right to a degree to try to bridge the gap,\" Davenport said. \"They're not getting pushed out to the right by 10 years, but could you see two, three-year push-outs? I think that's absolutely reasonable.\"\n\nThe industrial sector is also likely to push harder on existing infrastructure that might not be operating at its full capacity limit, Obin said.\n\nAnd regulators such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are finding ways to step in, including by forcing PJM to reform its grid connection queue process to make sure new energy resources like the more than 100 GW of solar capacity currently in its pipeline can get plugged in more effectively.\n\nIn the meantime, as the grid works to grow and manage increased loads, the major tech developers will be forced to adapt, the experts who spoke with Yahoo Finance said.\n\nIf renewable energy sources such as new solar and wind developments remain stuck in connection pipelines, some companies may join xAI in looking toward non-renewable solutions like gas turbines that they can quickly bring online.\n\n\"A lack of capital is not the most pressing bottleneck for AI progress,\" Dan Dees, Goldman Sachs' co-head of global banking and markets, said in a report from the bank on AI's energy demand. \"It's the power needed to fuel it.\"\n\nJake Conley is a breaking news reporter covering US equities for Yahoo Finance.

This approach is undeniably effective for selecting top momentum stocks.\n\nTo that end, the magnificent seven stocks like Amazon.com, Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms, Inc. have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.\n\nA Detailed Look Into the Driehaus Strategy\n\nRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said, “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) considered the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.\n\nIt is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.\n\nMoreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.\n\nHere are three of the 13 stocks:\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising and subscription services through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Amazon has a Momentum Score of A. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for AMZN is 23%, on average.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet provides a range of products and platforms across multiple regions, including the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America. Alphabet has a Momentum Score of B. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for GOOGL is 16%, on average.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms focuses on creating products that allow individuals to connect and share with friends and family using mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality, mixed reality headsets, augmented reality and wearables globally. Meta Platforms has a Momentum Score of A. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for META is 20.5%, on average.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:58:08.171835+00:00"}

There has to be a trigger point. And I think you brought up a good point earlier in the show that maybe we do get the 10-year yield going to 5%. Is that the trigger that would uh I guess just send big tech back into profit taking mode?\n\n00:26 Jim\n\nI mean, it could. You know, it definitely could because if you look at the flows, the one thing that people forget is that there's massive flows into bond funds and there's massive interest in yield right now because there is a yield. Because and if we were to get more yield into bond funds and the like, you could see money moving that way and that could definitely give in to digestion. And keep in mind, if you take the top Meg 7 or the top 20 tech stocks out of the S&P, it's hardly doing anything. The Russell is still down on the year and the midcap, which is still unchanged on the year because they don't have very much of this big AI tech in it. So if you were to get higher rates, it could really be a drag on the stock market even further.\n\n01:30 Speaker A\n\nJim, I imagine you get a lot of questions from your clients and folks that use your research on the Meg 7. What are you telling them to do with some of these names today?\n\n01:41 Jim\n\nThat's a good question because I think it's a it's a it's a risk. It's definitely it's a risk. I think you need to understand that if you want to play some of these Meg 7s, you want to play them for big gains, you also have to be prepared for big losses. So you need to adjust your risk. I think the problem I see with a lot of people is they think it's all a one-way street. That you know, they look at all the the rallies in some of these stocks and I'm thinking Palatine here right now and they think that it's just, well, that's the way it's going to be and it's just a money money printing machine. Well, it is until it isn't. And that's the biggest risk you have to take with them.\n\n02:30 Speaker A\n\nYeah, uh you can go look no further than C3 AI. I mean, the stock crashed yesterday and is and I think it was a real wake-up call to folks that not all AI stocks are created equally, even if you have AI in your corporate name.\n\n02:49 Speaker B\n\nExactly. And we have had uh Wall Street analysts talk about that that you really want to stay within the ones that are um doing well, that have strong earnings. And of course, everyone names those uh big uh Meg 7 stocks and and the uh big players within um within AI. But uh so not all of them are created equally. But look, um you've had BFA uh BFA's Hartnett talk about uh the risk of a bubble and signs of a bubble. And I mean, you've had investors and retail investors coming in uh and and buying aggressively and there's been a lot of dip buying. Um so the investors have been increasingly going further and further out into risk and you've we've seen we saw recently just a couple weeks ago this sort of meme craze again. So there when you get this when you when you get to these levels and you're near record high levels, you expect a pullback at some point. We just don't know what the catalyst is going to be and sometimes it happens like that. Something happens and then you see a pullback.\n\n04:24 Speaker A\n\nBrook, real quick, um you know, Corrive stock hasn't gone anywhere since June.\n\n04:32 Speaker B\n\nYeah, well, certainly what we've seen though is a bit of a move in these, you know, summer months as these companies reported. We do know that over the past month alone, as we got more data out from these key AI players that Corrive has moved in line. But now we're seeing Corrive under a bit of pressure as maybe this hype around how the company is playing into the AI revolution is not all that it's banked up to be after such a premium, such a run since its IPO, we are seeing it under pressure this morning. But certainly, what I, you know, also want to say is that before before, uh you know, Corrive sort of has played such a role in this picture, we did see during that sell-off in April, so many investors move away from these Meg 7 as this fear really roiled the markets. And now we've seen investors, as these earnings like NES said, have really come to fruition, have really surprised investors. We see retail investors looking to get back in. And so it'll be it remains to be seen really how Corrive does play into this picture, but we know that over the past month, the results from these big AI players have led to results for Corrive.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:55:54.456208+00:00"}

And the fight to secure distribution rights took another turn in a fracturing, precarious, eat-or-be-eaten landscape that's remaking sports and how we consume them.\n\nThe UFC is the latest sports franchise to change media hosts. On Monday, Paramount (PARA) struck a seven-year $7.7 billion deal to become the exclusive home of all UFC events in the US. The agreement allows Paramount to stream all 13 of the UFC's marquee numbered showcases and 30 \"Fight Nights\" on its platform, Paramount+. Some of the numbered events will be simulcast on Paramount's sister broadcast network, CBS.\n\nSign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief Subscribe By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nThe announcement comes less than a week after Paramount secured a long-awaited merger with Skydance Media, offering an early victory for the new management team and a culturally influential franchise to bolster its streaming platform. The deal represents a significant pay jump for TKO Group Holdings (TKO), the UFC's parent company. Its previous partnership with Disney's ESPN to distribute UFC fights was valued at about $550 million per year.\n\nIn another changeup that underscores the UFC's hopes to grow its audience and the viewing dynamics of the streaming world, Paramount+ subscribers won't have to pay extra to watch UFC fights. This is a big deal: TKO and Paramount are moving away from the previous pay-per-view model. And the shift highlights the desire of streaming companies to beef up their offerings with variety, frequency, and recurring events.\n\nAll this is happening as media companies are splintering and recombining to outlast the demise of the pay-TV bundle, leading to a great re-shuffling of sports licensing.\n\nLast week, ESPN reached a landmark deal with the National Football League to acquire NFL Network and other league media properties. Part of the deal, in a blurring of media distributor and sports league, will have the NFL take a 10% stake in ESPN. The NFL also has a content partnership with Skydance, giving it equity in CBS, another rights holder.\n\nThe tech giants, always on the lookout for new eyeballs, are using their cash piles to push into sports too. In turn, leagues are pressing their advantage to command massive audiences, in what is arguably the last semblance of mass culture, to extract bigger sums for the privilege of showing their content.

It has partnered with local grocery stores, including its own brands like Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market, to deliver groceries to customers. But those items took customers into different online stores with separate checkouts and delivery fees that sometimes left shopper confused.\n\nNow, in the locations that Amazon is making the service available, customers will be able to check out fresh food and other items from the same cart. Same-day delivery will be free for Prime members on orders over $25 in most cities, or has a $2.99 fee if the order doesn’t meet that minimum. Customers without a Prime subscription can use the service for a $12.99 fee without an order minimum.\n\nAvailability will expand to 2,300 cities by year’s end and to additional places in 2026.\n\nThe service was trialed last year in Phoenix, Arizona; and this year in Orlando, Florida and Kansas City, Missouri. Amazon said that customers “embraced the convenience,” with many of them being first time grocery customers that “return to shop twice as often” compared to those who didn’t purchase perishable food items.\n\nWednesday’s expansion will “almost certainly expand Amazon’s market share in food,” said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData Retail.\n\n“As Amazon already has a lot of the logistical infrastructure in place, it should be able to grow profitably, which is something other online grocers have struggled to do,” he told CNN.\n\nThe company said that the service complements its existing grocery delivery offerings, including Amazon Fresh, which offers faster deliveries with a higher minimum payment, and Whole Foods Market.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy has said he’s “very bullish” about Amazon’s grocery business, which has gone through multiple directions since the 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods. Attempts at opening physical stores have struggled, as has Amazon’s attempts at operating a separate app for grocery delivery. Amazon had at one point offered Prime members free same-day delivery from Whole Foods Market, but the company now charges $9.95 for all Whole Foods deliveries.\n\nBut Amazon has found success with delivery under its core Amazon app, with the company generating $100 billion in grocery sales last year (excluding Whole Foods Market and Fresh). Jassy mentioned on the July 31 earnings call that the “very successful” fresh food pilot saw “strong customer adoption” with about 20% of customers using the service multiple times within the first month.\n\n“Our prices continue to be low and sharp for customers,” he added. “It’s one of the reasons our everyday essentials growth outpaced the rest of the business globally and represented one out of every three units sold.”\n\nHowever, Saunders said that Amazon “still has physical ambitions in grocery, as the bulk of food shopping still takes place in stores. Unfortunately, the strategy and pathway to success in that arena is a little more hazy.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T14:38:14.815893+00:00"}
