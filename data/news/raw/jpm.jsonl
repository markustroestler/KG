Consumers in the US have absorbed an estimated 22% of tariff costs through June, but their share will rise to 67% if the latest tariffs follow the pattern of levies in previous years, they wrote.\n\nThe net result: faster inflation. The core personal consumer expenditure index, one of the Federal Reserve’s favorite measures of inflation, will hit 3.2% year-on-year in December, according to the Goldman analysts. They said underlying inflation net of tariffs would be 2.4%. The rate was 2.8% in June.\n\nThe report adds weight to a widespread view among economists that Trump’s sweeping tariffs will fuel inflation at a time when Fed policy has become a hot topic not just for bond traders but even for the president himself. Trump has broken convention by publicly calling for the Federal Reserve to cut rates, suggesting Fed Chair Jerome Powell should resign and adding an ally — at least temporarily — to the monetary policy committee.\n\nBond traders are now looking ahead to Tuesday’s inflation data for clues on how fast the Fed can cut. Treasury 10-year yields rose around seven basis points last week, but fell during European trading hours Monday.\n\nTraders are pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting in September, but the prospect of more easing in the months to come is clouded by the uncertain impact of tariffs on inflation.\n\nStaggered Impact\n\nMost economists consider tariffs to be inflationary, since logic suggests companies will pass the additional costs onto their customers. But the view isn’t unanimous — and the debate partly comes down to definitions.\n\n“Inflation, certainly as it’s relevant to a central bank setting monetary policy, concerns an ongoing increase in the overall price level,” said Oren Cass, founder and chief economist at American Compass, in a recent episode of Bloomberg’s Trumponomics podcast. “If you choose a specific policy that by design makes a one-time change in the price of certain things, that is not inflation in a sense that you would want a central bank to worry about.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:43.660762+00:00"}

Businesses have historically leaned on automation during recessions, and AI could hit white-collar knowledge workers especially hard, JPMorgan warned.\n\nBusinesses trying to do more with less have historically leaned on automation during recessions, but the advent of generative AI could scramble the typical pattern of winners and losers when the next downturn strikes.\n\nWhile white-collar knowledge workers have previously not suffered from severe recession-induced layoffs or jobless recoveries, the next time could be different, JPMorgan senior U.S. economist Murat Tasci said in a note Tuesday.\n\n“More specifically, we think that during the course of the next recession the speed and the breadth of the adoption of the AI tools and applications in the workplace might induce large-scale displacement for occupations that consist of primarily non-routine cognitive tasks; henceforth non-routine cognitive occupations,” he wrote.\n\nSince the late 1980s, jobs that focus on routine tasks have been disappearing because of automation, Tasci said. That includes “routine cognitive occupations” like sales and office jobs, as well as “routine manual occupations” such as jobs in construction, maintenance, production and transportation.\n\nOver the past four decades, it’s taken longer and longer for routine jobs to bounce back after recessions. In fact, employment in routine occupations has still not returned to its peak before the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nBy contrast, “non-routine cognitive occupations”—white-collar knowledge workers like scientists, engineers, designers, and lawyers—were much less cyclical and barely dipped below pre-recession peaks. They have also led prior employment recoveries most of the time, Tasci observed.\n\n‘Ominous’ sign in unemployment pattern\n\nBut an unprecedented shift in unemployment trends could indicate that white-collar knowledge workers will suffer a much different fate in the age of AI.\n\nFor the first time ever, workers from non-routine cognitive occupations now account for a greater share of the unemployed than workers from non-routine manual jobs (i.e. healthcare support, personal care, and food preparation).\n\n“Workers who were last employed in non-routine cognitive jobs have always accounted for the smallest share of the unemployed in the data, until recently,” Tasci said, calling it an “ominous” sign. “This changing pattern might be indicative of rising unemployment risk for these workers going forward.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:45.148991+00:00"}

The difference between spreads on individual bonds and the average of the index is the lowest on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2009.\n\nRisk premiums are low for top-notch and weaker companies alike.

When you get tight spreads, you get a lot less dispersion.”\n\nThe growth of both credit index and fixed-maturity funds probably plays a role here: investors are increasingly just buying most of the market, flattening out the differences in bonds’ yields. The lack of variability makes it difficult to find bargains.\n\nMassive inflows have swamped corporate bond funds recently as investors chase securities offering higher yields than Treasuries, even if spreads are relatively tight.

There’s also uncertainty about levies for other major gold-producing countries. Speculation is even swirling that the US government issued the ruling in error, and that it could be legally challenged.\n\nThe decision extends a tumultuous year for gold, which has soared to unprecedented levels amid strong buying from central banks and as Trump’s trade war drives haven demand. Earlier this year, physical flows were upended as traders rushed billions of dollars worth of gold and silver into the US as New York prices traded at large premiums in anticipation of potential tariffs. However, that trade came to a crashing halt after the US included gold and silver in its list of exemptions from the tariffs announced in early April.\n\nThe US Customs notice was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\n“In the long run, the existence of US tariffs on deliverable gold products raises the question on the role of futures trading in the US,” said Joni Teves, a strategist at UBS AG. “Until there is clarity, we expect the gold market and precious metals markets more generally to remain very nervous.”\n\nThe decision, if it remains in place, has sweeping implications for the flow of bullion around the world, and potentially for the smooth functioning of the US futures contract. Gold’s role as a financial asset and global currency sets it apart from other commodities like copper that have been roiled by tariffs, and traders said on Friday that shipments were freezing up in response to the shock news.\n\nTraders, analysts and executives across the industry had understood the bars would be exempt from reciprocal tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump, such as a 39% levy on Swiss goods. But when a gold refiner in Switzerland asked about it, US Customs and Border Protection clarified that one-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars are subject to the levies, according to a letter from the agency.\n\nFutures in New York, which are backed by bars shipped from Switzerland and other key trading and refining hubs, surged overnight to a record. They later erased those gains after an official said Friday that the White House intends to issue an executive order to clarify what that person described as misinformation.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- A Trump administration ruling that gold bars will be subject to tariffs stunned traders who had assumed they would be exempted, throwing bullion markets into turmoil.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Comex exchange in New York is one of three key global pricing venues, alongside London and Shanghai, where prices are now trading at a big discount.\n\nThe chaos has been exacerbated by the absence of a formal announcement or explanation. The CBP’s ruling, which says that one-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars should be classified under a different category than the one that received the exemption, was not initially made public but has now appeared on the CBPs website.\n\nThe decision will have particularly significant implications for refiners in Switzerland, which as the largest gold refining hub plays a particularly crucial role in the smooth functioning of the global market. If prices in London and New York move out of lockstep, Swiss refiners can melt down the larger bars that are traded in the UK capital so they can be delivered against US futures contracts, and vice versa.\n\n“Gold is moved back and forth between central banks and reserves around the world,” said Robert Gottlieb, a former precious metals trader and managing director at JPMorgan Chase & Co., referring to the bars. “We never, ever thought that it would be hit by a tariff.”\n\nOne-kilo gold bars are the most common form traded on Comex, the world’s largest gold futures market, and comprise the bulk of Switzerland’s bullion exports to the US. The country’s gold exports have become a flashpoint in its trade negotiations with the US, after a surge in shipments earlier this year caused the US’s trade deficit with the country to spike.\n\nThe levy could add to troubles for Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter after Trump handed Switzerland the highest country tariff among developed nations. She made an emergency trip to Washington on Thursday aimed at swaying the White House, but came away empty-handed after being denied a meeting with Trump.\n\nShipments Stop\n\nThe Swiss Precious Metals Association said in a statement on Friday the ruling threatens to negatively impact the international flow of physical gold.\n\n“We are particularly concerned about the implications of the tariffs for the gold industry and the physical exchange of gold with the U.S., a long-standing and historical partner for Switzerland,” said Christoph Wild, president of the ASFCMP.\n\nManagers at two major gold refineries in Asia, who did not want to be named discussing sensitive information, said they are pausing shipments to the US until there is more clarity on the tariffs. Several traders and refiners in Switzerland and elsewhere said they are taking similar steps.\n\nContracts for December delivery jumped to a premium of more than $100 an ounce above the global benchmark for spot prices in London, as investors bet on the tariffs snarling imports. That premium tumbled to about $61 following the official’s comments on the excecutive order.\n\nImports and exports for all countries are classified by an intricate system of codes that are used to set the scope of any levies.\n\nThe CBP letter said the gold bars fall under code 7108.13.5500 rather than the non-tariffed 7108.12.10 as expected. That classifies them as a “semi-manufactured” rather than “unwrought” type of gold, according to the US International Trade Commission’s website.\n\nIt’s unclear whether other types of gold bars, such as 400-ounce bullion that’s the most-traded in London, will be subject to tariffs. If not, those could simply be shipped to the US and recast into one-kilogram blocks, said a manager of a major refinery, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nSuch a scenario would still render the CME contract unviable, according to Nikos Kavalis, managing director at consultancy Metals Focus Ltd, since the US only has limited gold refining capacity.\n\nUS monthly gold imports surged to a high of 43 tons in January this year, as traders raced to ship metal to the US ahead of any possible tariffs. That compares to average monthly production by gold refiners in the US of 22 tons last year, according to US Geological Survey data.\n\n“The gap between the spot price and the futures price will be prone to issues of capacity. I just don’t see that as being in anyone’s best interest,” he said. “I suspect that this is a misunderstanding or an error on the part of the customs authorities, or if not an error, let’s say a poor assessment. I suspect it’ll be legally challenged or lobbied.”\n\n--With assistance from Yvonne Yue Li.\n\n(Updates with price move, plan to issue executive order in second paragraph, updates premium)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:55.967385+00:00"}

Citigroup C and JPMorgan JPM have surged 29.9% and 19.7%, respectively, over the same period, highlighting BAC’s relative underperformance.\n\nYTD Price Performance\n\n\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs one of the most interest rate-sensitive major banks, Bank of America saw its net interest income (NII) rise when the Federal Reserve began cutting rates, easing deposit costs. In 2025, however, the Fed kept rates steady amid uncertainty over Trump’s proposed tariffs and broader macroeconomic headwinds. Now, as the labor market is weakening, market participants are projecting rate cuts to resume from September.\n\n\n\nIn the first half of 2025, Bank of America recorded 5% year-over-year growth in NII driven by decent loan demand, higher-for-longer interest rates and a robust deposit balance. The bank continues to see an upside in NII this year and expects NII growth in the range of 6-7%.\n\nBank of America: Other Factors to Consider\n\nBranch Expansion & Digital Initiatives: Bank of America’s aggressive branch expansion across the United States as part of a broader strategy to solidify customer relationships and tap into new markets will drive NII growth over time. By 2027, it plans to expand its financial center network and open more than 150 centers. Of these, 40 are expected to be opened this year, and 70 more in 2026. The company also remains committed to providing modern and state-of-the-art financial centers through its ongoing renovation and modernization project.\n\n\n\nLikewise, JPMorgan is doubling down on physical expansion to strengthen its competitive edge in relationship banking. In 2024, the company opened more than 150 new branches and remains on track to add 500 more by 2027.\n\n\n\nOver the past few years, BAC has been renovating and updating its existing financial centers across the country for clients to engage with financial specialists and ensure a consistent and modern experience across all centers. The bank's strategic investment in new financial centers and expansion into new markets reflect a broader industry shift toward optimizing branch networks to deepen customer relationships and tap into new business opportunities. In this competitive environment, the ability to blend digital convenience with in-person expertise is expected to give Bank of America long-term leverage in the evolving banking landscape.\n\n\n\nThe company plans to continue strengthening its technology initiatives and spend heavily on these. These efforts help it attract and retain customers and boost cross-selling opportunities.\n\n\n\nFortress Balance Sheet & Solid Liquidity: Bank of America’s liquidity profile remains solid. As of June 30, 2025, average global liquidity sources were $938 billion. Also, the company’s investment-grade long-term credit ratings of A1, A- and AA- from Moody’s, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, respectively, and a stable outlook facilitate easy access to the debt market.\n\n\n\nBAC continues to reward shareholders handsomely. The company has cleared this year’s stress test conducted by the Fed and raised the dividend by 8% to 28 cents per share. In the last five years, it hiked dividends five times, with an annualized growth rate of 8.72%.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, JPMorgan and Citigroup cleared their stress test and announced plans to increase quarterly dividends. JPMorgan intends to declare a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share in the third quarter of 2025, representing a rise of 7% from the prior payout. Further, Citigroup announced an increase in its quarterly dividend by 7% to 60 cents per share.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Bank of America has announced a new share repurchase plan. Under this, the company is authorized to buy back shares worth $40 billion, which became effective from Aug. 1. As of June 30, 2025, the previous program had almost $9.1 billion in repurchases remaining.\n\n\n\nWeak Investment Banking (IB) Business: As global deal-making came to a grinding halt at the beginning of 2022, it weighed substantially on Bank of America’s IB business. Though the company’s total IB fees plunged 45.7% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023, the trend reversed in 2024. Thus, the company’s IB fees soared 31.4% year over year.\n\n\n\nThis year has had its share of hiccups. It began on an optimistic note, although the market sentiment cooled after Trump’s tariff policies launched on 'Liberation Day'. Given the headwinds in the first half, Bank of America’s IB fees declined 6% year over year.\n\n\n\nAfter the initial setback, deal-making activities are regaining momentum, with many deals that were put on hold resuming as there is more certainty about the direction of the economy and tariff plans as capital remains available. This will act as a tailwind for Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup, which generate billions in revenues from M&A advisory fees.\n\n\n\nDeteriorating Asset Quality: Bank of America’s asset quality has been weakening. While the company recorded negative provisions in 2021, a substantial jump in provisions was recorded in the years after that because of the worsening macroeconomic outlook. The metric surged 115.4% in 2022, 72.8% in 2023 and 32.5% in 2024. Similarly, net charge-offs grew 74.9% in 2023 and 58.8% in 2024. The uptrend for both continued in the first half of 2025.\n\n\n\nAs interest rates are less likely to come down substantially in the near term, it is expected to hurt the borrowers’ credit profile. The company remains vigilant about the effects of continuous high rates and quantitative tightening on its loan portfolio. Also, the impact of tariffs on inflation is likely to be seen. Hence, the company’s asset quality is expected to remain subdued.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:59.240431+00:00"}

With its iconic CEO Jamie Dimon at the helm, JPM has grown into one of the largest financial service firms globally, with operations in more than 60 countries. JPM has four major segments under its umbrella, including:\n\nChicago, IL – August 6, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares JPMorgan JPM as the Bull of the Day and Carter’s Inc. CRI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on General Motors GM, Ford F and Tesla TSLA .\n\nStory Continues\n\nJPM’s Aggressive Growth Strategy\n\nJPMorgan is expanding its global banking footprint aggressively, with plans to open more than 500 new banking branches over the next two years. This move will solidify its position as the most extensive banking network, allowing the company to boost market share and benefit from cross-selling and network effects.\n\nBottom Line\n\nJPMorgan’s reasonable valuation, its consistent earnings, and its ability to capitalize on favorable interest rate environments set the stock up for continued outperformance.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nHeadquartered in Atlanta, GA, Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Carter’s Inc. is the largest seller of branded apparel and baby-related products. Notably, the company runs a portfolio of popular brands, including Carter’s, OshKoshB’gosh, Just One You, Child of Mine, Simple Joys, Skip Hop, and Precious Firsts. CRI sells its products through leading department stores, national chains, and specialty retailers, both domestically and internationally. The company sells through retail partners like Amazon, Walmart, Targetand Macy’s.\n\nDeclining Birthrate a Long-term Headwind for Carter’s\n\nThe US birthrate has been declining consistently for the past seven decades. However, as economic conditions, social, and cultural winds shift, the birthrate in the United States has shrunk even further. Meanwhile, widespread access to contraception has also weighed on the birthrate. Because Carter’s is focused on the baby segment, this is a troubling long-term headwind with no end in sight for CRI investors.\n\nCRI Suffers Amid Weak Consumer Trends, Suspends Guidance\n\nCarter’s, like others in the industry, has been witnessing the impacts of a challenging macroeconomic environment, which is affecting its top-line performance. In addition, the current tariff environment has introduced significant uncertainty, making it difficult to predict the company’s future financial performance. As a result, Carter’s has decided to suspend providing guidance until there is more clarity on the internal operational direction and external market conditions. The company also cited a highly volatile retail landscape, ongoing macroeconomic pressures, and foreign currency headwinds, particularly in its international markets, as added factors contributing to the lack of forward visibility. Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that EPS growth will continue to plunge into 2026.\n\nDriven by the continuation of these trends, Carter’s first-quarter 2025 sales declined 4.8% from $661.5 million posted in the year-ago period. The decline was due to macroeconomic pressures, including inflation, elevated interest rates, and weakening consumer confidence, which reduced demand across segments. We note that the company’s shares have exhibited relative weakness, losing 49.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 43.4% decline.\n\nCRI Faces Tariff Headwinds\n\nCarter’s faces significant tariff pressures, with proposed increases on imports into the U.S. adding to existing duties, which amounted to approximately $110 million in 2024. These rising tariffs, particularly on products manufactured in Asia, are impacting cost structures, especially given that less than 5% of baby apparel is produced in the Western Hemisphere. While the company has actively engaged in lobbying efforts and evaluated nearshoring alternatives in Latin America, high labor costs and limited infrastructure in the region make it challenging to offset the tariff burden effectively.\n\nBottom Line\n\nA falling birthrate, weak consumer trends, and a negative outlook are all reasons to avoid baby retailer Carter’s.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nAfter a Hot July for GM EV Sales, Is the Stock Still a Buy?\n\nGeneral Motors sold more than 19,000 electric vehicles (EVs) last month, up a whopping 115% year over year. The surge was largely led by strong demand for the Chevrolet Equinox EV model. The US legacy automaker is advancing well in its electrification journey, thanks to its robust portfolio, including 13 models across its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac brands.\n\nGeneral Motors was the second-largest EV seller in the United States last year, just behind Tesla and managed to keep up the momentum through the first half of 2025. General Motors’ EV sales in the last reported quarter more than doubled. Meanwhile, GM’s closest peer, Ford, witnessed more than a 30% drop in second-quarter EV sales year over year. EV giant Tesla recorded a 13.4% decline in deliveries in the three months ending June.\n\nWhile General Motors' EV sales have been impressive, it will be interesting to watch if the company can sustain its sales growth amid policy shifts and U.S. President Trump’s unfriendly stance on e-mobility. Let’s take a closer look at the company’s fundamentals to assess if General Motors is worth buying at the moment.\n\nGM Maintains EPS Beat Streak in Q2 Despite Tariffs\n\nGeneral Motors’ second-quarter 2025 earnings beat was its 12th straight quarterly beat. Strong vehicle demand and stable vehicle pricing led to record first-half 2025 revenues of $91 billion. GMNA (General Motors North America) segment revenues were also a first-half record at roughly $77 billion.\n\nThe company was hit with $1.1 billion in net tariffs in the last reported quarter, although EPS of $2.53 exceeded expectations by 6%. However, GM expects net tariff costs in the third quarter to be higher than in the second quarter. It stuck to its guidance of gross tariff impact of $4-$5 billion for the full year but expects to offset roughly 30% of that through strategic initiatives like cost cuts, stable pricing and production adjustments. GM reaffirmed its adjusted EBIT forecast for the full year between $10 billion and $12.5 billion.\n\nGeneral Motors Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | General Motors Company Quote\n\nFactors Favoring General Motors\n\nIn the first half of the year, GM’s U.S. market share climbed to 17.3%, up 1.2 percentage points from the same period last year — a steady, positive trend. The company continues to expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint and domestic supply chain, while also investing heavily in battery, software, and autonomous vehicle innovation. Internationally, GM is making meaningful progress. In China, it’s working closely with its joint venture partner to improve sales, streamline inventory and boost profitability.\n\nThe strong performance of its new energy vehicles is also boosting results. Chevrolet has emerged as the number two EV brand in the United States, thanks to the success of the Blazer EV and Equinox EV. Meanwhile, Cadillac became the fifth-largest EV brand in the last reported quarter. GM is also scaling its hands-free driving system, Super Cruise. The technology is on track to generate over $200 million in revenues in 2025, with expectations to more than double by 2026.\n\nThe company’s investor-friendly moves also augur well. It completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2025, retiring 10 million more shares. This brings the total shares bought back under that program to 43 million. Notably, GM resumed open market buybacks in early July.\n\nGM’s Performance & Valuation\n\nOver the past three months, shares of General Motors have risen 16%, outperforming the industry as well as Ford and Tesla, which gained 5% and 12%, respectively.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, General Motors appears relatively undervalued. The stock trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 0.29, well below the industry’s 2.64. GM also boasts a Value Score of A. In comparison, Tesla and Ford trade at a P/S ratio of 9.7 and 0.27, respectively.\n\nWhy Buying GM Stock Isn’t a Good Idea Now\n\nWhile GM continues to make strides in EVs and innovation, near-term headwinds are worth noting. Fleet pricing has come under pressure due to rising competition, and this trend is expected to persist in the second half of the year. GM also flagged higher warranty costs, particularly for the L87 powertrain and early EV software issues, which will be a drag in 2025.\n\nCapital spending remains high and can weigh on free cash flow. While the company expects 2025 capex to be in the range of $10–$11 billion, the figure is expected to rise slightly to $10–$12 billion in 2026 and 2027 as GM ramps up production and future model launches.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM’s 2025 EPS and sales implies a year-over-year decline of 11% and 4.3%, respectively.\n\nAdjusted EBIT for the first half of the year came in at $6.5 billion. Based on full-year guidance, second-half earnings are expected to be about $1.75 billion lower at the midpoint of the outlook. This is essentially due to three reasons. First, tariffs will remain a burden. Second, the company expects lower wholesale volumes in North America. Lastly, increased spending to prepare for the rollout of next-gen full-size trucks and the expansion of U.S. EV capacity will also weigh on the results.\n\nAdditionally, EV profitability may take a hit from softening demand because of the phase-out of government incentives like the federal tax credit. Given these headwinds, this isn’t the best time for new investors to jump in.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Other plays on SOFR have included bets on a 50 basis-point cut at the central bank’s next meeting, in September.\n\nLast week’s soft payrolls data has made investors more confident that the Fed will cut rates to buffer US growth — a move that Trump has called for but central bank officials have so far resisted. A report on Tuesday showed that the US service sector stagnated in July, further exacerbating those worries.\n\n“The market definitely is on edge after the July payrolls report on Friday, but there is still a lot of data to go before the September meeting,” said Molly Brooks, US rates strategist at TD Securities. “The Fed needs more than just one data indicator and one data point in order to shift its view.”\n\nSwaps currently price in a combined amount of easing equal to almost 60 basis points, up from around 30 basis points priced ahead of the payrolls report. Treasury yields have reflected the shift, with the 10-year yield at 4.24%, compared to a high of 4.49% last month.\n\n“Against the backdrop of slowing growth, slowing inflation (ex-tariffs), and the Fed moving closer to easing, the direction of travel for yields will be lower over the next several months,” said Dan Carter, portfolio manager at Fort Washington Investment Advisors.\n\nBullish momentum is also building in the cash market, where traders have jumped into long Treasury positions. The latest survey of clients from JPMorgan Chase & Co. shows outright long wagers are at their biggest levels since April.\n\nMeanwhile, Fed members are also showing signs of leaning toward easier monetary policy.
