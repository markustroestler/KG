With over $12 trillion in US retirement assets, even a modest allocation could translate into hundreds of billions in fresh buying.\n\n“This may be one of the most pivotal moments in Bitcoin and crypto’s path to mainstream adoption,” Mena Theodorou, co-founder of Coinstash, said in comments shared with DL News.\n\nSustained pension fund inflows could “broaden adoption, help dampen volatility, and embed crypto more deeply into mainstream financial infrastructure,” Theodorou added.\n\nSecond is the return of ETF inflows. Bitcoin funds have seen eight weeks of net inflows in the past nine, adding roughly $10 billion over that period, nearly 20% of the $54 billion they’ve pulled in since launching in January 2024.\n\nEthereum funds are also moving fast, with $460 million flowing into spot Ether ETFs on Friday alone, the fourth-biggest day on record.\n\nETF Store president Nate Geraci noted on X that “eight of the top 10 Ether inflow days, including all of the top five, have happened in just the past month.”\n\nFinally, a softer macro backdrop is fuelling rate-cut bets in the US.\n\n“Weaker-than-expected economic data from the US has spurred investors’ beliefs that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting,” Simon Peters, crypto analyst at eToro, said in comments shared with DL News.\n\nHe added that this could “cause further tailwinds to cryptoasset prices and take the total market capitalisation higher.”\n\nFutures markets now see an 88% chance of a Federal Reserve cut in September, a shift reminiscent of late 2024’s “rate cut rush” that doubled Bitcoin’s price in just four months.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin has gained 2.6% in value over the past 24 hours and is trading at $121,285.\n\nEthereum is up 1% in the same period to $4,255.\n\nWhat we’re reading\n\nKyle Baird is DL News’ Weekend Editor.

A weekend rally saw Ether surge to above $4,300, its highest level since December 2021.\n\nThe gains come on the back of mounting interest in cryptocurrencies among large investors. So-called digital-asset treasury companies — listed vehicles that pivot into accumulating cryptocurrencies — have to date amassed a Bitcoin stockpile worth $113 billion, according to data compiled by Coingecko. Equivalent vehicles for Ether have stockpiled some $13 billion of the token so far, according to strategicethreserve.xyz data.\n\n“Bitcoin’s climb toward record highs is being supported by steady institutional inflows into corporate treasuries, US spot ETFs and a shift in sentiment following new US tariffs on imported gold bars,” said Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets. “With gold facing supply bottlenecks and policy risk, Bitcoin’s role as a borderless, tariff-free store of value is gaining traction among investors.”\n\nBitcoin traded around $121,200 as of 6:15 a.m. in New York, while Ether was at $4,250.\n\nEric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, who has financial interests in several digital-asset entities, applauded the Ether rally in a post on X. Bloomberg News reported Friday that investors are being sounded out on a plan for World Liberty Financial, the Trump family-backed venture, to set up a public company that would hold its WLFI tokens.\n\nEther options markets reflected the bullish sentiment with an overall put-call ratio 0.40.

It is outpacing even Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which is up 25% for the year. Purely on the basis of price performance, XRP looks like a no-brainer crypto investment.\n\nBut, under the surface, there are three issues that investors need to be aware of. While they may not sink the price of XRP, they can easily keep a lid on this cryptocurrency's price performance for the remainder of this year.\n\nCentralized coin supply\n\nXRP has a total circulating supply of 59 billion coins. Based on that number alone, you might assume that XRP is widely held. But that's simply not the case. The top 10 XRP blockchain wallets hold 41% of all supply, and the top 20 XRP blockchain wallets hold 50% of all supply.\n\nMoreover, a relatively small number (663) of blockchain wallets hold at least 5 million XRP each. If you do the math, that implies that a minimum of 3 billion XRP tokens, or roughly 5% of the total circulating supply, is likely held by Ripple insiders.\n\nThat all adds up to a very top-heavy ownership structure. Even though XRP has been around for more than a decade, the total number of individual holders of XRP worldwide is estimated at less than 2 million. And, in order to join the upper 10% of XRP holders, all you would need to do is acquire 2,500 XRP for a price of $7,500. That's how shallow the ownership base is.\n\nThis centralized coin supply came to the fore in July. At nearly the exact moment that XRP hit a 52-week high of $3.65, a wave of selling hit the market. As it turns out, a co-founder of Ripple had sold 50 million XRP tokens for a total price of $175 million. Not that there's anything wrong with that -- it's perfectly OK to lock in your gains on your crypto holdings.\n\nBut here's the thing: XRP went into a market swoon shortly thereafter, losing approximately 15% of its value. All of a sudden, a cryptocurrency that seemed like it was heading to the moon crashed back to earth, and is now trading for just $3. So buyer beware: if a huge crypto \"whale\" decides to dump his or her coins, you will ultimately feel the impact in your own portfolio.\n\nThe SEC court case that won't go away\n\nAnother major factor is the long-running SEC legal case involving Ripple, the company behind the XRP token. Back in December 2020, the SEC determined that XRP was a security, not a cryptocurrency, and filed a lawsuit against Ripple for selling unregistered securities. That case, believe it or not, is still ongoing after nearly five years.\n\nWhat's particularly disappointing is that, at various points over the past two years, the case looked like it was done. In summer 2023, for example, the SEC case looked like it was finally over after a favorable court ruling, and XRP rallied hard. But then the appeals process went into motion, and that's where we are today. In order for the case to go away forever, the SEC still has to drop all final appeals in the case, and that's something it has not done yet.\n\nThis is problematic because XRP's epic rally after the 2024 presidential election was predicated on a very simple idea: the arrival of a pro-crypto administration would sweep away all the regulatory issues swirling around XRP and Ripple. Until this SEC case goes away, a number of key growth catalysts -- such as the planned launch of new spot XRP ETFs -- may be put on hold.\n\nTariffs\n\nJust when the market seemed to have forgotten about tariffs, here they are, back in our lives. Back in April, the crypto market tanked as soon as the White House rolled out its \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. Then, when the tariffs were paused, delayed, suspended, and reduced, the crypto market rallied. But now that the August tariff deadlines have passed, the crypto market is once again showing weakness.\n\nSee a pattern here? You don't need to be a genius to see that tariffs appear to be tremendously destabilizing for most cryptocurrencies. And XRP appears to be in the bucket of cryptocurrencies that aren't going to hold up so well.\n\nComplicating matters further is the fact that the primary use case for XRP -- cheap, efficient, and fast cross-border payments -- is exactly the type of use case that would appear to be most at risk from tariffs. Simply put, if countries aren't trading with each other, or doing so at much lower volumes, there simply may not be as much demand for XRP.\n\nIs the XRP glass half full or half empty?\n\nI'm not trying to be a pessimist here. I actually think XRP has tremendous upside potential over the long haul. The cryptocurrency has real utility, and it has a number of positive growth catalysts in its favor, including the potential launch of spot XRP ETFs later this year.\n\nHowever, until there is further resolution of the SEC case against Ripple, and until there is more clarity around tariffs, XRP might face some choppy waters ahead, especially in the coming months.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T11:12:52.325137+00:00"}

I asked ChatGPT to run the numbers and break them down like I was back in middle school.

Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention was mostly an experiment among tech enthusiasts and cryptography fans. There were no big exchanges, no meme coins and no Super Bowl ads for crypto wallets. Most Americans had never even heard of bitcoin, let alone thought about investing in it.\n\nBut let’s say you did. Maybe you stumbled across a forum post, got curious and decided to put $100 into bitcoin in October 2009. How much would you have today? ChatGPT’s answer was as clear as it was mind-blowing.\n\nHow Much Was Bitcoin Worth in 2009?\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, bitcoin first had a measurable price in October 2009, when it was listed on the NewLibertyStandard. At that time, 1 BTC was valued at approximately $0.0009. That’s less than a tenth of a penny. To put it in perspective, you couldn’t even buy a single stick of gum for that price.\n\nIf you invested $100 at that price, you would have gotten roughly 111,111 bitcoins. That’s right, over one hundred thousand coins for the price of a nice dinner out. At the time, most people mining or buying bitcoin had no idea what it would become. Many early wallets were lost, forgotten or never even backed up.\n\nTrending Now: I Asked ChatGPT To Explain TRUMP Crypto to Me Like I’m 12: Here’s What It Said\n\nWhat’s Bitcoin Worth Today?\n\nFast forward to July 2025 and bitcoin is trading at around $106,000 per coin, according to recent market data from CoinMarketCap. Some sources even put the price slightly higher, but $106,000 is a solid, conservative estimate for this calculation.\n\nLet’s Do the Math\n\nSo, what would your $100 investment be worth today? Here’s how ChatGPT broke it down:\n\n111,111 bitcoins x $106,000 per bitcoin = $11,777,766,000\n\n“At the current market price of $106,000 per BTC, that original $100 investment would now be worth nearly $11.8 billion,” ChatGPT wrote. Yes, a billion with a “B.” All from an initial investment of just $100. It’s the kind of return that sounds made up, but the numbers check out.\n\n“That projection assumes no coins were sold, lost or taxed over the 15 years, an unlikely but technically possible scenario,” ChatGPT wrote.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T11:13:02.516289+00:00"}

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .\n\nWhile several asset managers, including ProShares, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have filed for XRP ETFs since late 2024, BlackRock’s absence is notable, especially given its dominance in the bitcoin and ether ETF markets.\n\nHere are five reasons why BlackRock appears in no hurry to launch a spot XRP ETF, despite the XRP community’s anticipation of a demand-driven price surge.\n\nFirst, BlackRock has cited limited client interest in cryptocurrencies beyond BTC and ETH. Back in March 2024, Robert Mitchnick, the asset manager's head of digital assets, said that there's a misconception that BlackRock will have a \"long tail\" of other crypto services.\n\n\"I can say that for our client base, bitcoin is overwhelmingly the No. 1 focus and a little bit ethereum,\" he said during a fireside chat at the inaugural Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22.\n\nSecond, BlackRock’s strategic caution around regulatory uncertainty plays a role.\n\nAlthough XRP sales on public exchanges are deemed non-securities, the broader regulatory framework for altcoins remains murky. BlackRock may be waiting for clearer SEC guidelines before entering the altcoin ETF space.\n\nThe firm’s conservative approach contrasts with competitors like ProShares, which filed for a spot XRP ETF in January 2025 alongside leveraged and futures-based XRP ETFs, the latter tracking XRP futures contracts rather than the token’s spot price.\n\nThird, BlackRock may see diminishing returns in pursuing a spot XRP ETF given the crowded field. As of August 2025, at least seven firms, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and 21Shares, have a pending spot XRP ETF application.\n\nFourth, the XRP community’s expectations of a price surge may not align with BlackRock’s data-driven strategy. Polymarket odds for the SEC approving a spot XTP ETF in 2025 stand at 77%. BlackRock's tokenized money market fund on Ethereum and Solana shows blockchain interest, but XRP’s smaller market footprint may not justify the operational costs of a new ETF.\n\nFinally, BlackRock’s global perspective prioritizes markets where XRP demand is less pronounced. While the XRP community, active on platforms like X, anticipates a spot ETF driving demand, much of XRP’s trading volume comes from Asia, where BlackRock’s ETF presence is less dominant.\n\nAt press time, XRP was trading around $3.1852, down 3.92% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T11:13:04.431377+00:00"}

According to data compiled by Visa, stablecoin supply increased from about $12 billion in 2020 to $220 billion in 2025. Some insiders think that's only the start, with Galaxy Digital Holdings predicting stablecoin supply will exceed $400 billion this year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent thinks it could reach $2 trillion by 2028.\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to real-world assets such as the U.S. dollar. They offer users the benefits of the blockchain -- such as speedy, low-cost transactions -- without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum (ETH 0.97%).\n\nLet's look at why stablecoins are set to soar, what might hold them back, and how investors can take advantage of this emerging trend.\n\nWhy stablecoins are about to soar\n\nStablecoins have been gaining traction for several years. Various companies, including cryptocurrency exchanges, payment processors, and banks, have made big strides in integrating stablecoins into their operations.\n\nTwo promising stablecoin use cases are international money transfers and payments. The World Bank says the average cost of remittances is about 6.4% of the transfer amount right now. Coinbase estimates that stablecoins could cut this to between 0.5% and 3%.\n\nBut the reason stablecoins could take off now is that lawmakers have given them a launchpad. In June, the U.S. government passed the Genius Act, legislation that gives a clear framework for stablecoins. It contains guidelines for stablecoin issuers about reserve requirements, audits, and anti-money laundering practices. It paves the way for both banks and non-banks to issue stablecoins.\n\nNot only does the new legislation remove roadblocks that had made companies hesitant about pursuing this emerging technology, but it also goes a long way toward building consumer confidence. Investors lost billions of dollars after the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin in 2022. Now, people want to be sure that stablecoins will retain their value and that issuers have enough reserves to support their tokens.\n\nHow investors can ride the stablecoin wave\n\nRight now, stablecoins only account for 1% of global money flows, according to consulting firm McKinsey. Recent regulatory changes could well unlock further growth, but to do so, there will also need to be further technical development and a shift in consumer habits. It isn't yet clear how the market will evolve. For example, we may see big companies issuing their own stablecoins or existing players dominating the stablecoin spectrum.\n\nHere are two approaches investors might take:\n\n1. Invest in listed companies that may profit from a stablecoin explosion\n\nMany of the businesses in the crypto industry remain privately held, which somewhat limits the stablecoin plays available to investors. However, there are opportunities in crypto exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and payment infrastructure.\n\nThese include:\n\nCircle CRCL 3.99% ) : Circle, which issues the popular stablecoin USD Coin USDC -0.01% ) initially rose by 700%. It has fallen since then, and some see it as still overvalued.\n\nCircle, which issues the popular stablecoin initially rose by 700%. It has fallen since then, and some see it as still overvalued.

In terms of stablecoins, Robinhood is part of the consortium that is behind the PayPal PYPL -0.82% ) : The payment giant launched its own stablecoin, PayPal USD PYUSD 0.03% )\n\nBear in mind that some think speculation around cryptocurrency and stablecoin growth has already pushed the prices of several of these companies to unsustainable highs. Go beyond short-term trends and research the long-term outlook before investing.\n\n2. Invest in the cryptocurrency ecosystems where stablecoins are being built\n\nStablecoins run on smart-contract blockchains, which can host self-executing pieces of code and act as ecosystems for other projects. If stablecoins take off, that could mean an increase in transactions for programmable blockchains like Ethereum, Tron (TRX 0.38%), and Solana (SOL 1.36%). That would mean more transaction fees, more assets on those networks, and -- ultimately -- a more secure future.\n\nLeading the pack right now is Ethereum. CoinGecko research shows that almost 50% of stablecoins are built on Ethereum. And a Galaxy report reveals that 50 non-crypto companies, including Louis Vuitton, Adidas, and Deutsche Bank, are using Ethereum to build products. It says the total value of stablecoins on Ethereum has increased by 70% during the past year.\n\nThere is one caveat: Some companies may build their own blockchains rather than rely on existing networks. That could give them more control and potentially be a more profitable way to enter the stablecoin sector, but it would mean today's cryptocurrencies don't benefit as much from stablecoin development.\n\nIt is still early days for stablecoins\n\nThe recent legislative changes come after years of stablecoin development work, meaning some projects may be able to storm ahead now that the regulatory road is clear. A soaring stablecoin market could transform our financial infrastructure, but there are still significant risks worth understanding.\n\nFor example, there are security, consumer protections, and privacy concerns that have yet to fully play out. Plus, while the Genius Act reduces the danger that a stablecoin will lose its peg or collapse completely, it is not impossible. It's important to ensure crypto investments make up only a small part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nNonetheless, mainstream adoption of stablecoins may be the biggest real-world use of crypto so far. If even a small percentage of that usage takes place on existing blockchains, that could be another major step toward mainstream adoption.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T11:13:10.084276+00:00"}

Investors might be reluctant to buy more Bitcoin after those massive gains, but it could still be a smart place to park $1,000.\n\nWhy did Bitcoin's price soar?\n\nFive main catalysts drove Bitcoin's price higher in 2024 and 2025: its spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs), its latest halving, lower interest rates, more crypto-friendly government policies, and big purchases from institutional investors, companies, and entire countries.\n\nLast January, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot price ETFs for Bitcoin. Those new ETFs made it easier for retail and institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts instead of holding the tokens in a digital wallet. They also supported the notion that it was a commodity like gold or silver.\n\nLast April, Bitcoin underwent its latest halving, which cut its mining rewards in half. That process occurs every four years and makes it increasingly difficult to mine Bitcoin for a profit. Some 19.9 million of Bitcoin's maximum supply of 21 million tokens have already been mined, and these scheduled halvings slow down that process, so the final token can't be mined until 2140. That programmed scarcity also makes it more comparable to a physical commodity like gold than other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs the Fed cut its benchmark rates three times in 2024, more investors pivoted back toward cryptocurrencies, high-growth stocks, and other speculative investments. Lower rates also eroded the value of the U.S. dollar, which increased the appeal of Bitcoin (and other commodities) as a hedge against the dollar's devaluation.\n\nIn the U.S., Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies faced an uncertain future under the Biden administration. However, most of those storm clouds dissipated after the Trump administration took over and adopted a more relaxed approach toward regulating cryptocurrencies.\n\nAll of those catalysts drove big institutional investors like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), tech companies like Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), and countries like El Salvador to accumulate more Bitcoin. The U.S. also recently established its own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. That support indicates that Bitcoin won't fizzle out anytime soon.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin a smart place to park $1,000?\n\nAll of those tailwinds should accelerate over the next few years. Lower interest rates and crypto-friendly policies should warm up the broader crypto market, which would then drive institutional investors to allocate higher percentages of their portfolios to Bitcoin ETFs. As that happens, Bitcoin could become more appealing as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation issues, while its next halving in 2028 will further increase its scarcity. Past performance never guarantees future gains, but it's worth noting that Bitcoin's price rallied higher in each of the years following its previous four halvings.\n\nHalving Date Price at the Time of Halving Following Year's Peak Price Gain 2012 $13 $1,152 8,762% 2016 $664 $17,760 2,575% 2020 $9,734 $67,549 594% 2024 $64,262 $122,980* 91%*\n\nAlthough Bitcoin's post-halving gains are slowing down, it could still have plenty of room to run before it peaks. It's already the world's most valuable cryptocurrency with a market cap of $2.2 trillion, but that's merely a sliver of gold's market cap of $23.1 trillion. So if you expect Bitcoin to eventually become \"digital gold,\" then its price could potentially climb tenfold and propel its market cap to $22 trillion. That's why some of its most bullish investors, including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, expect its price to top $1 million by the end of the decade. I'd take that outlook with a grain of salt, but it might be smart to invest $1,000 in Bitcoin and simply leave it alone for a few years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T11:13:13.660113+00:00"}

Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nWe’re now well into the second half of 2025 with stocks, home prices and Bitcoin at all-time highs.\n\nYou’d think times like this would be good and central bankers would pump the brakes because things might be going so well.\n\nBut here’s the thing.\n\nNational debt is also at an all-time high. In the United States, it has hit US$37.1 trillion and inflation on both sides of the border is likely accelerating. Despite this, commentators are calling for cuts to interest rates later this year, the loudest among them, the president, who would have us believe we are overdue for multiple cuts. This is the same person who simply “shoots the messenger” and fires public officials who issue reports that don’t fit his narrative. In this context, there’s very little that can be believed regarding economic data coming from the White House.\n\nThere is a symbiotic relationship between what politicians want for voters and what financial advisors tell their clients to expect. Politicians and financial advisors both benefit from people having an optimistic outlook. Even though markets don’t move in a straight line, both tell people to take a long-term view, stay the course and maintain discipline. Some politicians would go so far as to manufacture information to make the rose coloured glasses fit.\n\nPoliticians and central bankers typically do everything in their power to keep the economy from experiencing a prolonged downturn. Artificially propping up the economy when things are doing well and accentuating the positive is what I call “bullshift.” Both governing politicians and financial advisors want people to feel bullish — and shift their narrative accordingly.\n\nPut another way, the financial services industry shifts your attention to make you feel bullish, and politicians and central bankers self-servingly play along. It seems people (who are both investors and voters) are often coddled with a false sense of security. Because things have been seemingly favourable so long, I wonder how much resilience people will show when the going gets rough.\n\nRecency bias is a factor here. That’s when you think the recent past can be expected to persist in the near-term future. Here are two examples.\n\nThe first involves forgetting things that happened because it was too long ago. Inflation spiralled out of control in the late 1970s with central banks employing draconian measures to raise rates to unheard-of levels. For the next 41 years, until early 2022, interest rates dropped consistently — all the way down to zero. That’s a multi- generational bull market in bonds caused by money getting cheaper because of inflation becoming increasingly benign. But those days are over, and there is a strong consensus that deglobalization will keep inflation higher than what we’ve been accustomed to. This also means economic growth will be lower than what we’ve been accustomed to as we rebuild new supply chains with our geopolitical allies.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T12:01:28.643810+00:00"}

Here's what investors need to know today.\n\n1. US Stock Futures Point Higher as Investors Watch for Inflation Data This Week\n\nStock futures are pointing higher after the major market indexes posted gains last week, and ahead of inflation data and tech earnings due later this week. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.3% in the premarket after the blue chip index added 1.6% last week. Nasdaq futures are up 0.2% after the the tech-heavy index closed at a record high to finish last week. S&P 500 futures are little changed to higher in premarket trading. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note and oil futures are little changed. Gold futures are slightly lower after surging last week.\n\n2. Nvidia, AMD Strike Revenue-Sharing Deal With US for China Chips Licenses\n\nNvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are expected to give the U.S. government a 15% share of revenues from sales of certain chips sold in China in exchange for export licenses, the Financial Times reported. AMD said in its recent earnings report that restrictions on its China chip sales resulted in an $800 million hit. Nvidia is set to report its quarterly earnings later this month. AMD shares are about 2% lower in premarket trading, while Nvidia shares are down close to 1%.\n\n3. Intel CEO to Meet Trump After President Called for Resignation\n\nIntel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan is set to visit the White House after Trump called for his resignation last week, The Wall Street Journal reported. Tan could use the visit to address concerns about his personal and professional background, while also communicating the importance of Intel’s manufacturing capabilities, the report said. Shares of Intel are up 2% in premarket trading.\n\n4. Bitcoin Nears All-Time High, and Crypto Stocks Gain\n\nBitcoin (BTCUSD) is surging near all-time highs, rising more than 2.5% to trade above $121,100. Bitcoin’s record high was $123,218 set on July 14, when it jumped after the U.S. enacted legislation beneficial to the cryptocurrency industry. Shares of Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR) are up by more than 3% in premarket trading, while crypto brokerage Coinbase (COIN) and mining firms Mara Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are also higher.\n\n5. Albemarle and Other Lithium Producers' Stocks Surge After Production Delays at Chinese Mine\n\nShares of Albemarle (ALB), the world’s largest lithium producer, are jumping more than 10% in premarket trading as Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) suspends production at a major lithium mine. Bloomberg News reported that the stoppage could last three months and is due to a permitting issue. Lithium is used to make electric vehicle batteries, among other industrial uses. Chile-based Sociedad Quimica y Minera, or SQM (SQM), is seeing its shares rise by more than 8%. The mining delays come after another Chinese lithium miner suspended production in July.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T12:39:29.675160+00:00"}

In formal terms, IV measures the one-standard-deviation range of an asset’s expected movement over a year. Tracking at-the-money (ATM) IV offers a normalized view of sentiment, often rising and falling alongside realized volatility.\n\nLast week, BTC’s short-term IV fell to around 26%, one of the lowest readings since options data began being recorded, before rebounding sharply. The last time volatility sat this low was August 2023, when bitcoin hovered near $30,000 shortly before a sharp move higher.\n\nOver the weekend, bitcoin jumped from $116,000 to $122,000, hinting at what can happen when volatility starts to expand. August is traditionally a period of low volumes and muted market activity, but rising IV suggests traders may be positioning for larger moves ahead.\n\nCheckonchain data shows this latest rally was a spot-driven move, which is a healthier market structure than a purely leverage-fueled surge. Open interest has been declining through August, meaning a sudden influx of leverage could amplify price swings if sentiment shifts.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Bulls Take Another Shot at the Fibonacci Golden Ratio Above $122K as Inflation Data Looms", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T12:39:30.949939+00:00"}

The elusive Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin white paper in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, after all. Even as Wall Street swallows blockchain technology whole, the core is still a spirit of disintermediation.\n\nI joined Fortune in August 2022, the same month that the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that allowed users to input their (very traceable) cryptocurrency holdings and receive an anonymous output. The software, predictably, became a favorite of terrorist organizations and North Korean-affiliated hacking groups, but it also embodied the cypherpunk ideology that birthed the crypto sector.\n\nOFAC’s action created novel questions, such as whether a piece of code, rather than a person or organization, can be sanctioned. It also drew the ire of privacy advocates, who argued that internet users should have the right to own and send digital cash without government interference, just as offline people can with physical cash (to a degree). These, more than crypto bros trying to drive up the price of their tokens through sex toy-related stunts, are the fascinating dilemmas raised by blockchain technology, and what sets it apart from other forms of financial technology. (And as much as I hoped topics like Tornado Cash would dominate my coverage, Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire collapsed two months later.)\n\nA year after the sanctions, the Department of Justice brought charges against the creators of Tornado Cash, with one, Roman Storm, arrested in the United States. This was a tricky case for the crypto industry to get behind. The DOJ’s indictment made clear that the founders knew their software’s main utility was to help money launderers, including North Korea’s Lazarus Group, and they were earning millions of dollars off the platform through their own proprietary token. In a recurring segment I like to call “Are you taking notes on a criminal f***ing conspiracy,” one founder admitted over text that they had to relinquish control over the software to make it seem like they weren’t the owners. As one former DOJ prosecutor told me at the time, “These are pretty egregious facts.”\n\nBut many powerful voices in the crypto industry, including the venture giant Paradigm, still threw their weight behind Storm, arguing that the government’s case eroded the idea of privacy-preserving software and was in direct contradiction to previous guidance issued by the financial crimes division of the Treasury Department.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T12:45:34.362456+00:00"}

A good person, if you see a crime happening, you step in and try to stop it.”\n\nWozniak found out he had been impersonated in scam ads several years earlier and is still fighting a 2020 case in court against YouTube for its lack of action in taking down the content.\n\nThe Apple co-founder said he discovered the scam after his wife, Janet, received an email from a victim asking when they would get their money back.\n\nThe scammers had \"actually taken video of Woz talking about Bitcoin,\" Janet explained. \"Then they put a nice frame around it with a Bitcoin address, and said that if you sent him any amount of Bitcoin, he would send you double that back.\"\n\n\"Look at spam, look at the phishing attempts just all over the place,\" Wozniak said. \"And there's not enough real, I don't know, muscle to fight it.\"\n\nDeepfake fraud on the rise\n\nWozniak’s warning comes amid an explosion in AI-generated deepfakes and increasing online fraud.

A lack of robust moderation and oversight for online ads, especially on social media and video platforms, has allowed spammy, misleading, and outright fraudulent content to flourish.\n\nWozniak's criticism of YouTube echoes that of UK Liberal Democrat MP Max Wilkinson, who last week called for ads on the platform to be regulated to the same standards as television and radio in the UK.\n\n“Regulations need to catch up with the reality of how people are watching content,” Wilkinson said, warning that “unscrupulous advertisers must not be allowed to use loopholes to exploit people.”\n\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, told Decrypt it removed over 5.1 billion ads and restricted another 9.1 billion in 2024, suspended 39.2 million advertiser accounts for major violations, and blocked ads on 1.3 billion publisher pages.\n\nThe company said it has strict ad policies, invests heavily in enforcement, and has thousands of people working around the clock to police its platforms.\n\nIt's not the only tech company that has come in for criticism of its content moderation abilities.

Secondly, cumulative spot and futures trading volumes are notably lower than in July (see Chart of the Day) , when prices first topped $120,000, according to Swissblock Technologies. This negative volume divergence indicates weaker buying pressure.\n\nThe bullish mood remains more pronounced in ether than bitcoin. On Deribit, the notional open interest in ether calls is nearly 2.3 times greater than in ether puts. The figure for bitcoin is well below 2. ETH's rise is supported by on-chain activity, with daily transaction volume on the network hitting records and the number of new addresses nearing the high reached four years ago.\n\nStill, ether appears vulnerable to pullbacks because 97% of ETH-holding addresses are \"in-the-money,\" according to Sentora. In other words, the current price is above the acquisition cost of most addresses, which means there is a strong incentive for these holders to take profits.\n\nA similar trend exists for XRP, the payments-focused cryptocurrency, which lagged over the weekend but rose 3% early Monday. Speaking of the broader altcoin market, it could soon have its time because BTC's dominance rate is close to breaching a key support. (Check the Technical Analysis section.)\n\nIn traditional markets, the U.S. two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to short-term interest-rate expectations, held below its 200-day average for the first time since 2022. The decline is consistent with expectations for Fed interest-rate cuts.\n\nThe case for a September reduction has strengthened, with some analysts suggesting that even a hotter-than-expected CPI release this week would not deter the Fed from easing.

Although gross emissions remain fixed at 1 trillion QUBIC tokens per week, the adaptive burn rate approved by the network’s Computors, the key validators and decision makers, will increase substantially — burning some 28.75 trillion tokens and reducing net effective emissions to about 21.25 trillion tokens.\n\nMacro Aug. 12: The U.S.-China trade truce, which temporarily reduced reciprocal tariffs from triple-digit levels to about 30%, is set to expire.

Former STG holders would instead participate in LayerZero’s broader token economy without a dedicated yield mechanism.\n\nLayerZero argues the merger will streamline governance, reduce overlap and concentrate value in one token, positioning the combined platform for stronger network effects.\n\nEarly community reaction was mixed: Some STG holders say the swap undervalues their tokens compared with historical highs and current income streams, while others want improved terms or alternative incentives to offset lost yield.\n\nIf approved, the move would be one of the largest token mergers in this cycle’s layer-1 ecosystem, setting a precedent for how tightly linked protocols manage governance consolidation and revenue redistribution.\n\nDerivatives Positioning\n\nBitcoin's early Monday rally failed to inspire increased activity in derivatives, where futures open interest (OI) remains pinned below 700K BTC. That's notably lower than late July's 742K BTC peak and points to a spot-driven rally or risk aversion among traders.\n\nEther OI ticked higher to 13.68 million ETH from 12.70 million ETH, indicating demand for leveraged plays. The tally remains well below the July peak of 15.30 million ETH.\n\nCapital is flowing into altcoin derivatives, as XMR, UNI and BCH lead open interest growth among top 25 tokens by market value. That's not necessarily bullish because only BCH, BTC, BNB, UNI and HYPE boast positive OI-adjusted cumulative volume deltas (CVDs) , a sign of net buying pressure. The 24-hour CVDs for other coins were negative.\n\nOn Deribit, options-based implied volatility term structure for ether was inverted, pointing to stronger demand for short-term options. This, coupled with positive call-put skews, indicates market euphoria, a situation characterized by speculative demand for immediate bullish plays.\n\nBullishness returned to longer term BTC options as prices topped $120,000.\n\nBTC block flows for August have mostly featured volatility selling strategies.

Check out three intertwined reasons why investors are giving Bitcoin a second look this year.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/09/3-reasons-to-buy-bitcoin-before-2026/", "published_at": "2025-08-09T14:03:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Is Bitcoin finally going mainstream? Check out three intertwined reasons why investors are giving Bitcoin a second look this year.\n\nCryptocurrencies don't always make sense. It may seem silly to buy digital coins that are traded on a very expensive global network of number-crunching computers. Legendary investor Warren Buffett doesn't see any real-world value in Bitcoin (BTC 1.29%) at all, because the darn thing doesn't actually make anything or provide a service. And besides all that, Bitcoin will likely never get back to the skyrocketing gains seen in the early years.\n\nSo I completely understand if you're skeptical about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2025. But the times, they are a-changin'. You may want to set up a small Bitcoin stake as part of a larger, diversified investment portfolio, preferably before the end of the year. Here are three interconnected reasons why.\n\n1. First and foremost: Regulatory progress\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles for cryptocurrencies has always been the murky legal landscape. Without a clear legal framework for buying, trading, and owning cryptocurrencies, large investors like billionaires and financial institutions are unlikely to enter this market. That's bad news for the Bitcoin community's ambition of becoming a digital version of wealth-storing gold.\n\nHold those thoughts; I'll get back to them in a minute.\n\nBut in 2025, there is finally some meaningful progress as governments and regulators clarify the rules for buying, selling, and holding Bitcoin. The Trump administration is not only exploring firm crypto rules, but also set up a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a United States Digital Asset Stockpile to manage cryptocurrencies under a federal banner.\n\nThis new transparency is helping to tame the wild west reputation of crypto and giving investors more confidence that they're operating on solid ground.\n\n2. Result: Bitcoin is becoming a better \"digital gold\"\n\nLet's get back to the wealth-storage train of thought.\n\nWith the regulatory fog lifting, Bitcoin's original pitch as \"digital gold\" is starting to look a lot more credible. The asset will never have more than 21 million coins on the market, and 19.9 million of them have already been created. This fixed supply and Bitcoin's decentralized design have always made it attractive during periods of inflation or currency turmoil.\n\nNow, with official recognition and improving oversight, it's easier to see Bitcoin as a legitimate long-term store of value -- one that isn't just for tech enthusiasts or risk-takers, but for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio.\n\nFor example, noted growth investor Cathie Wood noted that the Bitcoin supply is now growing slower than the amount of new physical gold mined each year. Therefore, Wood sees Bitcoin as a better inflation hedge than gold bullion, and suggests holding more Bitcoin than gold in a risk-hedged and diversified investment portfolio.\n\n3. Last but not least: Clearer rules inspire large-scale investors\n\nAnd that brings me back to the idea of large-scale investors motivating any asset's long-term price moves -- including Bitcoin's.\n\nWhen the rules are clear, the big players feel more comfortable joining the game. In fact, they may have felt legally obliged to leave Bitcoin alone until the trading manual cleared up.\n\nIn 2025, that's exactly what's happening. Pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors -- once worried about regulatory uncertainty -- are beginning to allocate capital to Bitcoin. The presence of Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) makes a big difference, and the leading iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT 3.30%) already has $85 billion of assets under management. That's a record-breaking growth story, just 19 months after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe institutional investor participation boosts market stability and also signals growing mainstream acceptance. And that starts the tick-tock motion of a financial flywheel -- broader market acceptance drives Bitcoin prices higher, which throws more fuel on the digital asset's marketing fires.\n\nSo the pieces of the Bitcoin puzzle are coming together in 2025. I can't guarantee a smooth ride to the moon, but it looks like a sensible idea to include at least a little bit of Bitcoin in your long-term portfolio. Whether you buy the cryptocurrency directly or rely on ETFs like the easily available iShares fund, you don't have to go all-in.\n\nJust a dab could do a lot of good, as long as the bullish Bitcoin trends I see today continue to play out. And I think starting to get in on Bitcoin before the calendar turns to 2026 is a good idea. Keep it small enough that you'll be just fine if Buffett's Bitcoin skepticism turns out to be more accurate than Wood's bullish view.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T13:51:56.599622+00:00"}

They were just starting to ask questions in the early ‘90s about retirement, which was some 20 years off for them, and how much they could spend and how much they needed to save.\n\nWhen I tried to find answers to those questions in literature, from other advisors, from textbooks, there was nothing available. That’s really not surprising because at that time it was just starting to become a big issue because my generation was the first really to have such a long life expectancy in retirement.\n\nIf you retired in the ‘50s or ‘60s you might have looked forward to about 10 years of retirement, and that's about it. But the rest of us now are looking at 20, 30, even longer periods of time.\n\nRead more: How much should I have saved by 50?\n\nCan you explain in the simplest way possible, what the 4%, now 4.7%, rule is?\n\nI basically reconstructed the investment experience of hundreds of retirees from 1926 to date and tested them with various withdrawal rates from retirement accounts, primarily IRA accounts, over a 30-year period. And back in ‘94, I came out with a number, 4.15% as the lowest safe withdrawal rate for any person. So if you use that number, you would've always been successful with 30 years of withdrawals. It’s actually not something I recommend to everybody — it’s a very conservative number.\n\nDid you ever expect when you came up with a 4% rule that this was going to become the gold standard?\n\nNot a clue. I was doing it for my clients at that time. It's an amazing thing.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T13:51:58.320042+00:00"}

Bloomberg estimates this number today to be even higher — around $12.5 trillion.\n\nWhile most portfolios remain concentrated in stocks and bonds, the policy shift opens the door for plan sponsors to offer funds linked to Bitcoin and other private assets.\n\nEven a modest allocation could have a market impact. Bitwise’s Head of Research, Ryan Rasmussen, noted that just a 3% allocation of 401(k) assets to crypto would amount to about $240 billion in inflows.\n\nWhen factoring in its 60% market dominance, this equates to around $144 billion into Bitcoin alone.\n\nSupply crunch\n\nThose sums would be chasing a market where the liquid Bitcoin supply is already feeling a squeeze.\n\nData from analytics firm CryptoQuant show that Bitcoin reserves on centralised exchanges have fallen to about 2.5 million, their lowest level in about seven years.\n\nAt current prices, that’s only $300 billion worth.\n\nIf retirement-plan demand materialises through products like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, issuers will need to secure the underlying coins to cover fresh investments.\n\nAnd ETFs aren’t the only competitor.\n\nThis also comes amid a growing trend of aggressive corporate treasury buying.\n\nFirms such as Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet have been making large-scale Bitcoin purchases for their balance sheets, often several times a month.\n\nData from Bitcoin Treasuries shows 164 public and private companies now hold close to 1 million Bitcoin worth over $116 billion, approaching 5% of the total max supply.\n\nKyle Baird is DL News’ Weekend Editor.

Discover SCENE\n\nPublic Keys is a weekly roundup from Decrypt that tracks the key publicly traded crypto companies.\n\nCoinbase Convertible Raise\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase is raising a little spending money—just $2 billion—in convertible notes.\n\nSure, we hear this kind of thing a lot when it’s Bitcoin and Ethereum treasuries. But the San Francisco-based company said this raise will be used for “general corporate purposes” and “acquisitions of other companies, products, or technologies.”\n\nThe announcement landed right after some analysts (not all), decided they didn’t like the look of that 25% revenue drop in Q2.\n\nCompass Point moved COIN from the Neutral to Sell column, saying that the revenue miss was confirmation that the company’s retail trading business is “getting disrupted” by decentralized exchanges and ETFs.\n\nThat could help explain why Coinbase just rolled out decentralized exchange trading in its app for its U.S. users.\n\nMore worrying, though, was the fact that subscriptions and services didn’t have more to contribute, the analysts said. That’s the line item that covers the premium Coinbase One memberships, stablecoin revenue, staking, and custody services.\n\nWith the presidential ink dry on the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act, USDC issuer Circle a few months into its tenure as a publicly traded company (remember, they have a revenue sharing deal), and the proliferation of digital asset treasuries—analysts were expecting that segment to overperform.\n\nCore Combo Fight\n\nOne of Bitcoin miner Core Scientific's top investors wants to cut the music on the Core fusion dance.\n\nTwo Seas Capital, Core Scientific’s largest active shareholder with a 6.3% stake, intends to vote against a $9 billion all-stock sale to CoreWeave, saying in a press release Thursday that the offer represents an “inadequate valuation.”\n\nThe firm said it has established such a large stake in Core Scientific because it believes it’s a strong contender to build “critical, high-performance computing infrastructure at scale”—the infrastructure very much needed to power the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nTwo Seas, which is also an investor in CoreWeave, said the structure of the deal shortchanges CORZ investors and leaves them absorbing volatility from CRWV.\n\n“In our view, the transaction decidedly and unfairly favors CoreWeave at the expense of Core Scientific shareholders,” the firm added, chiding the board for not entertaining offers from other suitors.\n\nThe vote hasn’t yet been scheduled, but it’s expected to take place before the end of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, Core Scientific reported its Q2 earnings after the bell on Friday. But there was too much potential merger fracas for an actual earnings call.\n\n“Due to the pending transaction with CoreWeave, Inc., which was previously announced on July 7, 2025, the Company will not be hosting a conference call or webcast to discuss its second quarter fiscal year 2025 results,” the company said.\n\nBlock Hearts Bitcoin\n\nBlock Inc. added 108 Bitcoin to its corporate holdings in Q2, bringing its total corporate holdings to 8,692 BTC—worth approximately $1 billion at the current price.\n\nKeep in mind, Block CEO Jack Dorsey has been a fan of Bitcoin since is earliest days. It should be no surprise that the company’s shoring up its own BTC treasury.\n\nWith an average cost of $31,248 per BTC, the company’s sitting on paper gains of 273.29%. But the more interesting data point comes from the Bitcoin the company sold—but not its own.\n\nBlock Inc. allows people to buy Bitcoin through its very popular Cash App. And of the $6 billion in revenue the company saw in Q2, $2.14 billion of it was generated just from Bitcoin sales in the app.\n\nThat Bitcoin revenue shows only a slight slowdown from Q1, when the company reported $2.3 billion in revenue from Bitcoin. If Block Inc. wants to see its 2025 Bitcoin revenue top last year, it’s going to need to see things pick up mightily in the back half of the year.\n\nIn 2024, Block reported $10.2 billion worth of Bitcoin revenue for the whole year—meaning that it’s lagging behind that mark now.\n\nBut Dorsey had promises of other Bitcoin news during yesterday’s earnings call: “We're going to have some news very, very soon,” he said of Proto, the company’s Bitcoin mining initiative.\n\nAnd, wouldn’t you guess it, Proto has a deal locked in to sell its Bitcoin mining chips to none other than Core Scientific in one of the largest ASIC agreements ever signed.\n\nOther Keys\n\nBullish makes it official: Crypto exchange Bullish formally registered its initial public offering with the SEC, aiming to raise $629 million at a valuation between $3.8 and $4.2 billion.

Kiyosaki echoed that concern, writing, “America’s debt is out of control. America is the world’s biggest debtor nation in history. You can only print money to pay your bills… for so long.”\n\nWhile Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of equities for 11 straight quarters — and held a massive $344 billion in cash at the end of June — Kiyosaki didn’t cite a source for his claim that Buffett had dumped most of his holdings. Berkshire’s latest report still shows $267.9 billion in equity securities.\n\nKiyosaki pointed to an exodus from traditional assets, claiming, “DO YOU know investment legends Warren Buffet and Jim Rogers have sold most if not all of their stocks and bonds?”\n\nEven a fraction of that kind of collapse today would be catastrophic — especially given how heavily 401(k)s and IRAs are tied to the stock market. During the market sell-off in 2022, CBS News reported that 401(k) and IRA plan participants experienced an estimated loss of around $3 trillion.\n\nIt’s a chilling comparison. From Black Monday on October 28, 1929, to mid-November, the Dow lost nearly half its value — and the pain didn’t stop there. By the summer of 1932, it had plunged 89% from its peak.\n\n“DO YOU have a 401(k) or IRA filled with stocks?” he asked in a recent post on X. “Good luck. We may be on the brink of another 1929 crash and another Great Depression.”\n\nRobert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US — with millions of Americans going poor.

Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nBut “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki is sounding the alarm — particularly for Americans relying on stocks to fund their retirement.\n\nDespite a stumble earlier this year, the U.S. stock market has regained its footing — with the S&P 500 recently climbing to fresh all-time highs.\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHere’s a closer look at these assets.\n\nPrecious metals\n\nKiyosaki’s endorsement of gold and silver is nothing new — he’s been advocating for precious metals for decades.\n\nIn October 2023, he predicted on X, “Gold will soon break through $2,100 and then take off. You will wish you had bought gold below $2,000. Next stop, gold $3,700.”\n\nPrices surged in 2024 and have continued to climb through 2025, recently surpassing $3,300 per ounce.\n\nGold has long been viewed as a safe-haven investment. It’s not tied to any one country, currency or economy. It can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and investors tend to pile in during times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty — driving up its value.\n\nOne way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.\n\nGold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.\n\nTo learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free precious metals on qualifying purchases.\n\nBitcoin\n\nKiyosaki said he’s “sitting tight” with Bitcoin — no surprise, given his bullish outlook on cryptocurrency.\n\nKiyosaki recently called Bitcoin “people’s money” and predicted that “Bitcoin [will go from] $500K to $1 million.”\n\nStay in the know.

The publicaly traded company supports over 250 digital assets and has more than 320 different trading partners.\n\nWith a robust rewards program and potential to earn a high APY, Coinbase is great for newcomers to the cryptocurrency game. For those looking for a more powerful trading partner, Coinbase Advanced offers low-fees and a simple, intuitive user experience.\n\nStart a portfolio today and you can earn up to $200 in crypto.\n\nReal estate — revisited\n\nThis isn’t Kiyosaki’s first 1929 warning. Back in May — when Moody’s Ratings downgraded America’s credit rating — he warned of a Depression-style collapse and highlighted the power of one particular income-generating asset.\n\n“I have always recommended people become entrepreneurs, at least a side hustle and not need job security. Then invest in income-producing real estate, in a crash, which provides steady cash flow,” he wrote on X.\n\nReal estate has long been a favored asset for income-focused investors. While stock markets can swing wildly on headlines, high-quality properties often continue to generate stable rental income.\n\nIt can also be a powerful hedge against inflation. When inflation rises property values often increase as well, reflecting the higher costs of materials, labor and land. At the same time, rental income tends to go up, providing landlords with a revenue stream that adjusts with inflation.\n\nPerhaps that’s why Kiyosaki once disclosed he owns 15,000 houses — strictly for investment purposes.\n\nToday, you don’t need to be as wealthy as Kiyosaki to get started in real estate investing. Crowdfunding platforms like Arrived offer an easier way to get exposure to this income-generating asset class.\n\nBacked by world-class investors like Jeff Bezos, Arrived allows you to invest in shares of rental homes with as little as $100, all without the hassle of mowing lawns, fixing leaky faucets or handling difficult tenants.\n\nThe process is simple: browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, select the number of shares you’d like to purchase and then sit back as you start receiving any positive rental income distributions from your investment.\n\nAnother option is First National Realty Partners (FNRP), which allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.\n\nWith a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to Triple Net (NNN) leases, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.\n\nSimply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

While this idea might sound like science fiction, it highlights a very real long-term threat that could fundamentally reshape the crypto landscape.\n\nThe Quantum Computing Threat Explained\n\nThe concern isn’t entirely theoretical. Quantum computers could theoretically break the encryption that protects Bitcoin wallets by cracking private keys—the digital signatures that prove ownership of cryptocurrency. However, the vulnerability isn’t uniform across all Bitcoin holdings.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\nAccredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM—Secure $0.63 Shares Before 8/14\n\nAccording to analysis from Deloitte, approximately 25% of existing Bitcoin is currently vulnerable to quantum attacks, particularly coins whose public keys have been exposed through previous transactions. The remaining Bitcoin, including Satoshi’s untouched reserves, sits behind additional layers of cryptographic protection using hash functions that are considered quantum-resistant.\n\nThe distinction matters because Bitcoin addresses that have never sent transactions keep their public keys hidden, making them significantly harder targets even for advanced quantum systems. This technical detail explains why Satoshi’s dormant wallet has become a symbolic canary in the coal mine for quantum computing advancement.\n\nMarket Impact Scenarios\n\nIf Satoshi’s coins suddenly moved, the crypto community would face two competing interpretations. The optimistic view suggests it might signal that “the ship hasn’t sailed yet,” potentially attracting new investors who see the Bitcoin creator’s re-emergence as validation.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\nThe pessimistic scenario paints a far darker picture. Market analysts worry that any movement could trigger massive panic selling, particularly if investors interpret it as evidence of quantum computing breaches. Institutional investors, already skittish about crypto’s volatility, might “flee this mess long before it happens,” causing severe price crashes across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T13:52:04.639914+00:00"}

Grok largely replicated tried-and-true tips that personal finance writers have been sharing for years. Here’s what Grok said about how to become wealthy in the next five years.\n\nWhat Is Wealth?\n\nFirst, Grok clarified that wealth means “a significant net worth, not just a high income.”\n\nAcknowledging it’s a “tough goal,” it said it’s possible with focus, discipline, and a bit of luck.

For instance, a SaaS business targeting small businesses can scale fast with minimal overhead,” it said.\n\nIf you already have a full-time job and can’t leave, consider a side hustle in your field or doing something that leverages your natural skills and talents.

If the inflation report tomorrow shows a 0.3% gain or less, a rate cut is expected; a higher reading could derail these hopes and cause market turmoil.\n\nS&P 500 futures were flat this morning after the index closed up 0.78% on Friday, a new all-time high. Japan’s Nikkei 225 reached a record peak too, up 1.85% today. Stocks in Europe broadly held their gains in early trading.\n\nWhy all the optimism?\n\nBecause investors think the U.S. Federal Reserve will almost definitely cut interest rates in September, and they are hoping that the consumer price inflation report—due tomorrow—won’t show a significant rise in inflation.\n\nThe “Fed put” is in full effect, according to JPMorgan: “We expect moderate weakening in the macro data but enough to trigger a prompt Fed response” in September, according to Fabio Bassi and his colleagues.\n\nAnalyst consensus is that inflation will tick up 0.3% to 3%, according to ING, a small enough rise that the Fed will be able to ignore it in favor of cutting rates. The weak jobs report on August 1 was such a surprise that the central bank is now expected to ignore a small amount of inflation in favor of supporting the economy with a new dose of cheaper money.\n\n“Tomorrow’s US CPI report … could prove to be one of the larger events of the summer for markets,” Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank told clients this morning.\n\nIf CPI goes up by 0.3% or less, “that is a number that can probably be seen as acceptable for the Federal Reserve to proceed with a September cut (90% priced in), given the backdrop of a significantly weaker jobs market,” ING’s Frantisek Taborsky and Francesco Pesole said in a note this morning.\n\nThere’s one other reason investors are so confident that cut is coming next month: President Trump added Stephen Miran as a temporary Fed governor. They view him as having a single mission, to persuade the Federal Open Markets Committee to lower rates and weaken the dollar.\n\n“Stephen Miran drew headlines earlier this year for proposing a ‘Mar-a-Lago Accord’ to weaken the dollar and boost US exports. While the administration hasn’t formally embraced the idea, his appointment signals clear discomfort with dollar strength,” Convera’s George Vessey said in an email this morning. “Miran’s stance firmly aligns with the dovish camp.”\n\nOf course, the reverse is true, too. If that inflation report comes in higher than expectations, then the prospect of a September cut could disappear, which will likely cause some drama and selling tomorrow morning.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T14:00:12.037558+00:00"}

Get our newsletter directly to your inbox on all things Bitcoin-equities by clicking here.\n\nHut 8 reported Q2 revenue of $41.3 million and Jones-defined EBITDA of $3.7 million, missing JonesResearch’s forecasts of $50.6 million and $14.9 million. The gap was primarily due to the absence of revenue recognition for 15 EH/s of Bitmain miners at the Vega site. Core fees from ABTC totaled about $14.3 million from colocation and $0.9 million from managed services, equating to roughly $26,100 and $1,600 per megawatt per month, respectively, across 183 MW of contracted capacity.\n\nJonesResearch’s analysis of ABTC’s standalone results shows $30.3 million in Q2 mining revenue and $2.4 million in gross profit (8.1% margin) at an estimated hashcost of $0.047/TH. Low cash G&A of $2.5 million kept EBITDA near break-even.\n\nThe upcoming ABTC merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP) is expected to close in early September, with Hut projected to own 64.37% of ABTC, implying a $4.0 billion stake at ABTC’s current implied $6.2 billion market value. Hut’s own market cap sits at $2.1 billion. JonesResearch cautions that ABTC’s pre-merger valuation may be inflated by Gryphon’s limited float and prefers to see post-close trading normalize before drawing firm conclusions.\n\nHut ended Q2 with $216 million in cash, but only $11 million excluding ABTC equity proceeds. Through August 6, the company raised an additional $21 million via its at-the-market equity program.\n\nBeyond mining, Hut is advancing HPC projects, including expanding its River Bend site in Louisiana from 300 MW to a targeted 1 GW and building a 50 MW AI/HPC facility in Batavia, Illinois.

In an earlier post, he described an “on-chain wealth effect”: as ETH’s price rises, both large holders and retail investors see their positions turn profitable, prompting them to reallocate capital into smaller, higher-risk tokens in pursuit of bigger gains. This dynamic, he said, can amplify rallies beyond ETH itself.\n\nDeutscher also mapped out a three-stage market rotation he expects could take months to unfold: an ETH-led mini altcoin season, a rotation into bitcoin that could lift BTC toward $120,000–$140,000 while altcoins lag, and finally a shift back into ETH and smaller tokens for a potential “blowoff” rally marking the cycle’s peak.\n\n'Wild move'\n\nCrypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe called Saturday’s push to $4,200 a “wild move” and warned that buying at such elevated levels carried greater risk. While he sees ETH setting up for a breakout toward all-time highs, he argued that allocating capital to projects within the ETH ecosystem might deliver better percentage returns if momentum continues.\n\nHe also said earlier that continued ETH strength could set the stage for substantial gains in altcoins, potentially rewarding portfolios positioned for a broader market rotation.\n\nMarket intelligence platform Santiment noted that ETH’s climb above $4,000 on Aug. 8 was the first since Dec. 16, 2024, and came with a sharp increase in bullish language from retail traders. Mentions of terms like “buying” and “bullish” roughly doubled compared with “selling” and “bearish.” The firm cautioned that overconfidence can sometimes lead to short-lived pauses even during strong uptrends.\n\nTechnical Analysis Highlights\n\nAccording to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model, between Aug. 8 at 07:00 UTC and Aug. 9 at 06:00 UTC, ETH rose from $3,914.59 to $4,160.29, a 6% gain, trading between $3,885.03 and $4,194.53.\n\nThe first breakout occurred at 13:00 UTC on Aug. 8, pushing prices above $4,000 on 646,459 ETH in volume, nearly triple the 24-hour average of 218,847 ETH.\n\nA second surge at 05:00 UTC on Aug. 9 lifted prices to the session peak of $4,194.53 on 714,461 ETH in volume, again more than triple the daily average.\n\nIn the final hour (Aug. 9, 05:19–06:18 UTC) , ETH moved from $4,157.33 to $4,194.53 before retreating to $4,158.50, with $42.52 in intraday swings.\n\nBuying briefly pushed prices above $4,190 before profit-taking set in, establishing support between $4,155 and $4,160, suggesting consolidation as larger players locked in gains near the psychological $4,200 level.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

Year to date, XRP is up a resounding 42%. By way of comparison, crypto bellwether Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is only up 22%. So it's easy to see why many investors are focused on XRP.\n\nBut don't sleep on Ethereum (ETH 2.34%), the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. For the year, it is only up a modest 8%. However, over the past 30 days, Ethereum is up a head-spinning 40%. It now has the sort of momentum that XRP had earlier in the year. So should investors shift their focus from XRP to Ethereum in the second half of 2025?\n\nThe arrival of Ethereum Treasury Companies\n\nThe one catalyst that set off Ethereum's summer rally was the sudden appearance of high-profile Ethereum Treasury Companies. These companies, inspired by the success of Bitcoin Treasury Companies, are designed to do just one thing: Buy as much Ethereum as they possibly can, as fast as they can.\n\nThe one name that really stands out here is Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR 34.88%). Before June 2025, it was a sleepy little Bitcoin mining company. But then it hired Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee as its chairman, and things have really taken off. The company is in the process of reinventing itself as the world's top Ethereum Treasury Company.\n\nGiven Tom Lee's public profile, he's the sort of person who often pops up on CNBC. Increasingly, he's talking up the merits of investing in Ethereum. In doing so, he's playing the same evangelist role that Michael Saylor of Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) does for Bitcoin. So, given all this new buzz, other Ethereum Treasury Companies are also launching.\n\nIt should be pointed out that new XRP Treasury Companies have also formed this summer. But there is much less enthusiasm for them than for the new Ethereum Treasury Companies. That could change over the next 12 months, but for now, Ethereum has the clear edge.\n\nThe stablecoin investment thesis\n\nThere's another factor in Ethereum's favor: The rise to prominence of stablecoins. Everyone, it seems, has been talking about stablecoins this summer, from retailers to fintech companies to Silicon Valley giants. The U.S. Treasury Department has also pushed the stablecoin agenda.\n\nAnd guess what? The top blockchain for stablecoins right now is Ethereum. It accounts for a reported 49% of all stablecoin activity right now. The only other blockchain that comes close is Tron (CRYPTO: TRX).\n\nIn contrast, XRP is almost nowhere to be found in the ongoing debate over stablecoins. That's despite the fact that Ripple, the company behind the XRP token, launched a stablecoin of its own in December 2024 with the stated goal of boosting demand for XRP.\n\nAs might be expected, a very strong stablecoin investment thesis is starting to form around Ethereum. The growing perception is that it is going to become a primary beneficiary of stablecoin adoption. As more people begin using stablecoins for activities like making online transactions, it should lead to new activity flourishing on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as a much healthier Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nRenewed activity in spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are currently the only two cryptocurrencies with spot crypto ETFs. That is a key selling point with institutional investors, who are using these ETFs as a way to get exposure to the crypto market.\n\nAdmittedly, earlier in the year, there was a lot of talk over the slowing pace of money flows into Ethereum ETFs. In some months, there were actually net outflows. That makes sense -- Ethereum's performance earlier in the year was dreadful, and investors were quite rightly taking their money out of spot Ethereum ETFs and moving it elsewhere.\n\nBut here's the thing: Ethereum's summer rally has resulted in a new flood of money coming into the spot Ethereum ETFs. That's helping to push Ethereum higher as well.\n\nThat being said, new spot XRP ETFs could be coming any moment now. The SEC is currently reviewing a handful of spot XRP ETF applications, and has until mid-October to render a judgment on them. If the SEC approves them, that might help to close the \"ETF gap\" between XRP and Ethereum. But for now, Ethereum has the edge.\n\nEthereum is hardly a risk-free investment\n\nJust remember: Even though there are several factors that appear to make Ethereum a more attractive investment than XRP right now, it's hardly a risk-free investment. There's still enormous volatility in crypto, and Ethereum is no exception.\n\nHelping to mitigate this risk is Ethereum's long track record of performance that dates back to 2015. Investors now have a decade's worth of data to digest. If history is any guide, Ethereum will once again become a top market performer. Thus, while I can understand the allure of investing in an inexpensive $3 crypto like XRP, I'd rather put my money behind an expensive $3,600 crypto like Ethereum.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:06:52.944460+00:00"}

It's a staggering return given that the S&P 500 is up just 91% over that same period. That's still a solid return, but it pales in comparison to Bitcoin.\n\nBut what may be even more surprising is that a company that has simply been loading up on Bitcoins has been a far better buy than the cryptocurrency itself. MicroStrategy (MSTR 3.67%), which now goes by just \"Strategy,\" has climbed a remarkable 3,000% in five years. It hasn't been experiencing huge sales growth or become a top artificial intelligence (AI) company. Instead, it has just been accumulating Bitcoins, and its enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency has made it a red-hot stock for retail investors to buy.\n\nHowever, with the company already accumulating such massive gains in a short time frame, is it due for a crash or at least a correction? Or could it still be a good buy today?\n\nMore companies are following the same blueprint\n\nStrategy's remarkable returns over the years haven't gone unnoticed by other businesses. More companies are also eagerly investing in the top digital currency in the world as they try to appeal to retail investors. Social media stock Trump Media and Technology Group has recently announced it bought $2 billion in Bitcoin. The stock, largely a speculative play, is likely hoping a similar bullishness in crypto sends its valuation soaring. It's now the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Some other notable names that have accumulated significant amounts of Bitcoin include Block and Tesla.\n\nFor Strategy, it is still far and away the leader, owning nearly 629,000 Bitcoins as of Aug. 4. The next-largest corporate position belongs to crypto mining company Mara Holdings, which has 50,000 Bitcoins. But the sheer success of Strategy's approach could entice other businesses to do the same and start accumulating significant holdings of Bitcoin as well. If the novelty of Strategy's stock wears off, that could result in less bullishness and excitement, potentially leading to more muted gains for it in the future.\n\nA disconnect with fundamentals could make the stock ripe for a sell-off\n\nLoading up on Bitcoins has enabled Strategy's valuation to grow to a market cap of $110 billion today. It's large enough to now be part of the Nasdaq 100 index, which is made up of the top non-financial stocks on the exchange. (Strategy is technically involved in providing companies with business intelligence and analytics software.) A quick look at some valuation metrics highlights just how egregiously priced the stock has become: Strategy trades at more than 200 times its revenue, and its estimated forward price-to-earnings multiple, which is based on analyst estimates, is over 1,200.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, which ended on June 30, Strategy reported a monstrous net income of more than $10 billion despite only generating $115 million in revenue. The boost came, of course, from its position in digital assets. Strategy reported an unrealized gain of over $14 billion during the period, which was offset partly by a nearly $4 billion provision for income taxes. The business has benefited significantly from Bitcoin's rising valuation and the digital currency hitting record levels this year, but with such a large valuation and enormous volatility on its financials, it makes Strategy a highly speculative investment.\n\nCan Strategy's stock still be a good buy?\n\nIf Bitcoin continues rallying and Strategy keeps on to its tally of Bitcoins, it wouldn't surprise me to see the crypto stock rise even higher in the future. The temptation may be to think that Bitcoin is destined to continue going higher, but that's by no means a sure thing.

Let's take a look at the charts.\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe cryptocurrency market regained some lost ground this week, with altcoins such as Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin leading the way among the majors with strong gains.\n\nBitcoin remained mostly flat on the week, with a modest 1% gain to above $116,000 over the last seven days. But the overall crypto market is once again making a push toward that elusive $4 trillion figure, and alts are again outpacing Bitcoin’s gains.\n\nWhat accounts for the renewed optimism? Why, another Trump pump, of course.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's landmark executive order allowing alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, in 401(k) retirement accounts has injected fresh confidence into digital assets.\n\nThe charts are now again flashing bullish signs, and the broader context of Trump's executive order directing the Secretary of Labor to clarify the Department of Labor's position on alternative assets and allowing for more permissive rules on crypto could provide the fundamental catalyst these technical setups need to resolve bullishly. With traditional markets showing volatility and commodities under pressure from trade tensions, cryptocurrencies may benefit from rotation as investors seek diversification opportunities.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let’s dive into the weekly numbers:\n\nEthereum (ETH): Breaking above resistance\n\nIt will be music to ears of Ethereum maxis everywhere that the charts confirm what they are now feeling: the bullish vibe are back.\n\nEthereum is showing a strong technical setup when compared to other major cryptocurrencies, currently trading above $4,000—for the first time in eight months—with bullish momentum building across multiple timeframes. ETH is up 13% since this time last week, and it appears to only be getting started.\n\nEthereum price data. Image: Tradingview\n\nThe Average Directional Index, or ADX, for Ethereum is at 23, approaching the crucial 25 threshold. ADX measures trend strength on a scale of 0-100, where readings above 25 confirm a strong trend is developing. Traders watch this level closely as it often marks the transition from sideways trading to sustained directional movement. The rising ADX suggests Ethereum's recent strength could evolve into a more persistent uptrend, as it cancels the losses from a multi-month correction that tanked its price from December 2024 all the way to April 2025.\n\nEthereum’s Exponential Moving Averages, which consider the average price of the asset over a given period of time, also paint an increasingly bullish picture. The 50-week EMA (the average price over roughly a year of price movement) provides solid support well below current prices, and the 200-week EMA sits even lower. This configuration—where shorter-term averages trade above longer-term ones—typically signals sustained buying pressure that traders interpret as confirmation of an uptrend. The widening gap between these averages suggests strengthening momentum.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for ETH is at 68, approaching overbought territory above 70, but not quite reaching it yet. RSI measures how hot or cold a market might be, likewise on a scale from 0 to 100. An RSI of 68 indicates strong buying momentum without yet triggering profit-taking that often occurs above 70 from algorithmic trading setups. Historically, Ethereum can sustain RSI readings between 65-75 for extended periods during bull runs, suggesting more upside is possible before exhaustion sets in.\n\nThe Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows that that volatility has already been released from a previous compression phase in May. Theoretically, this means the current move has room to continue as the market isn't yet showing signs of another consolidation period forming.\n\nIn the medium and long term, all indicators point to a sustained bullish recovery. The prices broke past the resistance of an already bullish channel (the dotted green lines in the above chart) indicating that investors were willing to add even more fuel to the slow recovery. Last week’s prices corrected to the downside and this price line acted as a price support zone now.\n\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:0px;overflow:hidden;line-height:0\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span>\n\nTraders are so bullish that on Myriad, a prediction market built by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan, 60% of predictors expect ETH to hit $5,000 this year. That’s a 30% jump from today’s prices. What’s more, a whopping 70% of Myriad users expect a new ETH all time high, above $4,800, this year.\n\nKey Levels:\n\nImmediate support: $3,600\n\nStrong support: $3,200\n\nImmediate resistance: $4,103\n\nStrong resistance: $4,400\n\nXRP: Consolidating above critical support\n\nAnother group dancing in the streets today is the XRP Army, the community of XRP true believers that have continued to hold on throughout the ups and downs. Lately, there have been a lot more ups.\n\nXRP is currently trading at $3.23 maintaining position above the psychologically important round number of $3, with mixed but ultimately positive technical signals. The Ripple-linked cryptocurrency is up 9.79% this week.\n\nXRP price data. Image: Tradingview\n\nXRP’s ADX recovered some ground this week, now sitting at 21 points. This suggests the market is in transition. This \"no man's land\" reading indicates XRP is building energy for its next directional move—traders often see this as a coiled spring scenario where the eventual breakout could be significant.\n\nConsidering the major spike in XRP’s price between late 2024 and early 2025, this is to be expected as markets cool down and digest the massive move. Now, the price trend shows more equilibrium without losing its broader bullish trajectory.\n\nThe 50-200 EMA setup shows a heavily bullish gap—which is expected considering how low prices were in the last four years. The fact that XRP’s price trades above both averages is something traders would say is definitively bullish, indicating buyers are in control across multiple timeframes. The gap between the averages is also increasing, which means traders may expect a steady movement to the upside.\n\nThe RSI at 63 places XRP in what traders call the \"power zone\"—strong enough to indicate genuine momentum without pointing to FOMO. Based on this indicator alone, there is still room for XRP to grow before a major correction in the weekly charts.\n\nThe Squeeze Momentum Indicator's “off” status confirms we're in an active trend phase. Combined with the ADX reading, this double confirmation of trend activity gives traders confidence that moves in either direction will likely be significant but not explosive.\n\nKey Levels:\n\nImmediate support: $3\n\nStrong support: $2,69\n\nImmediate resistance: $3,372\n\nStrong resistance: $3,67\n\nDogecoin (DOGE): Range-bound with neutral signals\n\nDogecoin aficionados also have reason to celebrate—but they should be careful not to celebrate too early.\n\nDogecoin shows the most neutral technical setup at $0.2216, reflecting a market in equilibrium after recent volatility, but experienced a price recovery strong enough to rank third on the list of best-performing cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap. DOGE is now up 11.5% in the last seven days.\n\nDogecoin price data. Image: Tradingview\n\nThe ADX at 16 indicates no clear trend. Readings below 20 typically suggest choppy, directionless trading that frustrates both bulls and bears. DOGE is recovering from a heavy drop, which means any upward movement right now is more likely to be interpreted as a weakening of bearish trend rather than the establishing of a bullish one. But that also means this could be a period where smart money accumulates positions before the next trending phase begins.\n\nThe EMA configuration shows DOGE trapped between converging averages, creating what technical analysts call a \"squeeze play.\" The 50-week and 200-week EMAs are relatively close together and moving in tandem, indicating neither bulls nor bears have decisive control. This compression often resolves with explosive moves once a catalyst emerges, making DOGE a potential volatility play for traders watching for breakouts.\n\nThe RSI at 52 couldn't be more neutral if it tried—sitting almost exactly at the midpoint between oversold (30) and overbought (70). This reading suggests perfect equilibrium between buying and selling pressure with markets trading sideways.\n\nIn terms of price patterns, Dogecoin is showing a clear double bottom pattern—a price movement that forms a “W” shape on the chart—which traders would say is very bullish if confirmed. The last leg is respecting a support, so the pattern has not been broken. The coin tried to cancel this last week with a bearish movement, but the pattern proved strong enough and this week’s recovery puts prices back into the support zone.\n\nThe Squeeze Momentum Indicator showing “on” status is particularly significant. If other coins show that the squeeze phase is off, Dogecoin’s technicals point to a period of market pressure that is likely to finish with a major movement either up or down. Considering the current pattern in formation, it’s more likely than not to be a bullish jump as the double-bottom pattern suggests.\n\nKey Levels:\n\nImmediate support: $0.1950\n\nImmediate resistance: $0.2656\n\nStrong resistance: $0.3077\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:07:13.950095+00:00"}

It will make it easier for 401(k) investors to access non-traditional assets such as cryptocurrency and private equity.\n\nThe Trump administration has prioritized crypto-friendly policies that may help spur crypto adoption. This has sparked significant momentum for crypto markets, with bitcoin leading the way.\n\nAs Business Insider reports, though, the idea of opening up 401(k)s to alternative assets originally raised red flags for many people in the asset management and financial advisory spaces.\n\nIn their view, this policy change could compromise the low-risk, uncomplicated nature of 401(k)s, which is considered to be part of why many people trust them. However, the new executive order could mean both higher risk and reward for those who want to explore this new opportunity.\n\nAs Marcus Sturdivant Sr., managing member of The ABC Squared said, financial advisors had been discussing these issues with clients long before Trump's executive order.\n\nPrivate equity in a 401(k)\n\nMany people outside the financial sector may not fully understand what private equity is. This is partially because the private equity process of gaining exposure to companies that are not publicly traded has been reserved for high-net-worth individuals.\n\n\"Private equity lacks the transparency of publicly traded companies, and if they are placed inside a fund, the already lagging effect of the reported data will be increased,\" Sturdivant told Business Insider.\n\nHe added that the private equity industry also funds many companies that do not end up going public and, in some cases, lose a lot of money. That said, Sturdivant also acknowledged that some consider private equity to be one of the best long-term measures to grow wealth.\n\nHowever, there are still tradeoffs, and opening up a 401(k) to private equity may disadvantage some users due to timing, specifically the lock-up period on an investment, which can be either a pro or con.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n\"If you are older and near retirement or leave it as an inherited account, the private credit portion may be locked in for a period that makes the ten-year period to use an inherited retirement account impossible to access the funds,\" he noted.\n\nCrypto in your 401(k)\n\nIt is well known that crypto is subject to volatility, which has sparked concern among some policymakers who see it as high-risk for consumers.\n\nA group of Senators recently raised it in a letter to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director William Pulte, highlighting concerns with his plan to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac count crypto as an asset in some mortgage applications.\n\nSturdivant described the prospect of adding crypto to a 401(k) as intriguing but noted that coin and token performance can depend on a multitude of factors.\n\n\"How they grow can depend on the fund they are in, or whether they are individual, and if they are backed by a stablecoin,\" he said. \"If they are backed by a stablecoin, the returns will be tempered and inflation sensitive, not the outsized growth or loss as a token or coin, not a fiat-backed coin.\"\n\nThat said, Sturdivant also described the typical crypto volatility as simply the cost of the technology as it progresses, highlighting the fact that some prominent policymakers hold bitcoin.\n\n\"This legislation will not be a complete backstop to a bitcoin decline, but could stabilize a move as the US and countries around the world already hold and are adding bitcoin to their reserves,\" he predicted.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:07:18.940713+00:00"}

He said that Bitcoin would continue to grow to meet the needs of the underlying economy.\n\nIn the base case that Bitcoin is only used as a substitute for gold, Kelly said the asset still has a 7x growth potential. He arrived at this figure by dividing the market capitalization of gold, estimated to be $15 trillion, by the market capitalization of Bitcoin, estimated to be $2.5 trillion. His reasoning is that Bitcoin can surpass the market cap of gold if it is used as a substitute.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

Compared to many of its counterparts, including the grandfather of turning public companies into crypto buying machines, Strategy, ETHZilla is leaving out one key element: leverage.\n\nMcAndrew Rudisill, ETHZilla’s incoming chair, isn’t taking that chance on his Ethereum bet.\n\n“There will be a point in the cycle where maybe Ether runs to $15,000 and pulls back to $10,000.

There are approximately 220 companies that now hold some $424 billion, 17% of all the Bitcoin on the market, according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries.\n\nOf late, Ethereum, the industry’s second-largest digital asset by market cap, has become a popular choice.\n\nEthereum co-founder Joe Lubin kicked off the trend in June after his blockchain company Consensys co-invested $425 million in the online gambling company SharpLink Gaming.\n\nWall Street strategist and crypto bull Tom Lee joined shortly after converting a little-known Bitcoin mining firm called BitMine Immersion into one of the largest Ethereum treasury companies on the market.\n\nCampaigns to convert debt and equity into crypto are also trickling down to much smaller digital assets, such as the Ripple-founded XRP, crypto exchange Binance’s native BNB, and Telegram’s Toncoin.\n\n‘The new companies in those ecosystems will have a harder time getting oxygen.’ — Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital\n\nAnd investors continue to lap it up.\n\nWhen the Canadian vaping company, CEA Industries, announced it would invest $500 million into BNB on July 28, the company’s stock soared a whopping 548%.\n\nThe stock has fallen 70% since then, raising more questions about when investors will have seen enough.\n\n“We’ve probably gone through peak treasury company issuance,” Mike Novogratz, the chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital, told shareholders during his company’s earnings call on Tuesday. “The new companies in those ecosystems will have a harder time getting oxygen.”\n\nGoing onchain\n\nStill, ETHZilla’s Rudisill is confident his strategy will have plenty of breathing room.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum can generate additional yield via staking, a process where Ether is deposited into the network to validate transactions and earn rewards.\n\n‘There’s going to be rapid consolidation.’ — McAndrew Rudisill, incoming chairman of ETHZilla.\n\nOn top of that, ETHZilla has tapped investment firm Electric Capital, which also invested in ETHZilla, to use the company’s Ether holdings to generate more yield via different onchain lending opportunities. Rudisill declined to say how exactly.\n\nHe estimates that the strategy will generate “high single-digit to low double-digit” yield on the company’s Ether.\n\nShould the crypto treasury trend grind to a halt, Rudisill suggests that the firm’s lack of debt, diversified yield strategy, and strong team will separate ETHZilla from the pack.\n\nIt could even open up new opportunities.\n\nFire sale\n\nA sharp drop in crypto prices might force distressed companies to issue even more stock to raise cash or sell off their crypto holdings.\n\nSuch an event would be a boon for firms with the deepest pockets.\n\n“The big Ethereum treasury companies are going to get more Ethereum, and there’s going to be rapid consolidation,” Rudisill said.\n\n“And that’s going to be positive for Ether prices.”\n\nLiam Kelly is a Berlin-based reporter for DL News.

Currently, the U.S. retirement market is valued at $43 trillion, of which nearly $9 trillion is held in 401(k) plans, while the total cryptocurrency market is nearing $4 trillion.\n\nBitcoin’s integration into the retirement accounts of Americans could make it a core part of the nation’s financial system and promote long-term investment in the asset.\n\nBitcoin Poised to Soar\n\nBitcoin had a rough ride over the past month. The cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $123,153.22 in June but later gave up some of those gains. For most of July, it stayed relatively stable, fluctuating around $119,000. However, in the final days of the month, it dropped below $116,000, entering a short-term bearish zone.\n\nThe decline came as investors remained uncertain about how Trump’s tariffs would impact inflation. Although the White House said that it has reached trade deals with several nations, Trump announced hefty tariffs on several trading partners of the United States, including Brazil, Canada, India and Taiwan.\n\nAlso, the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at 4.25–4.5% in its July policy meeting. Although the move was expected, some investors had hoped for a 25-basis-point rate cut. Higher interest rates tend to hurt growth-driven sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary, and cryptocurrencies. Investors, however, are still optimistic that the Fed will implement two 25-basis-point rate cuts later this year.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:07:35.754552+00:00"}

Gox hack (the largest Bitcoin exchange at the time), which resulted in the of ~650,000 Bitcoin. Then there was the Silk Road marketplace, an online black market which sold drugs and used crypto as a medium of exchange. Finally, there was the FTX Exchange, which collapsed due to mismanagement and misuse of customers funds. In between each of these instances there were several smaller, yet devastating moments.\n\nNevertheless, the crypto industry has proven resilient. Today, there are 250 digital assets listed on Coinbase (COIN). Overall, there are more than 15,000 cryptocurrencies that are listed on more than 1,000 exchanges. Though the crypto industry remains a ‘Wild West’ in many areas, 2025 will be remembered as a banner year where crypto entered the political, institutional, and mainstream lexicon due to widespread access and formal regulation.\n\nCrypto Access to Explode Amid Trump 401(K) EO\n\n401(K) Executive Order\n\nThis week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will clear the path to allowing crypto currencies in 401(k)s and other retirement plans. The EO directs the Department of Labor to ‘reexamine’ past guidance that did not allow alternative assets like commodities, real estate, and crypto. Should digital assets be allowed in workplace retirement accounts it will open up crypto retirement plans to more than 70 million Americans, or more than half the US workforce.\n\nCrypto ETFs Gain Popularity as more Emerge\n\nAfter much anticipation Bitcoin ETFs finally debuted last year. Since then, Blackrock’s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin ETF Trust (IBIT) has had the best debut of any ETF in US history, and continues to garner massive trading volumes in 2025. In fact, According to AInvest, by Q2 2025, nearly 60% of institutional portfolio had allocated 10% of there AUM to Bitcoin or other digital assets. Realizing the immense success and potential of crypto ETFs, ETF managers have expanded their offerings to meet Wall Street demand with ‘alt coin’ ETF offerings like the Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the Ethereum ETF (ETHA).\n\nCrypto Treasury Stocks Proliferate\n\nStrategy (MSTR) has led the way in the crypto treasury space, gaining more than 3,000% over the past five years after adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Over the past year, several other publicly traded companies have followed MSTR’s lead and added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Meanwhile, crypto alt-coin treasuries are emerging. For instance, Bitmine Immersion (BMNR) has become the world’s largest Ethereum treasury.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:07:37.267229+00:00"}

Get our newsletter directly to your inbox on all things Bitcoin-equities by clicking here.\n\nMetaplanet uses moving-strike warrants (MSW), which mimics an at-the-market (ATM) offering for its common stock. Warrants are like call options. MSWs in particular are structured so the strike price of the option is always reset to the previous day’s closing price. When exercised, the MSW forces the company to sell common stock to the warrant holder at the previous day’s price.\n\nThis acts like an ATM offering, but it is structured as a derivative instrument to circumvent certain legal hurdles. Under Japan’s Companies Act, a company may issue “stock acquisition rights” (i.e. warrants) by board resolution without a full public offering or shareholder vote. Much like Strategy’s $21 billion MSTR ATM, Metaplanet’s MSW generates an immediate growth in BTC per share when the company trades at a premium to its BTC treasuries.\n\nMetaplanet also issued a number of zero-coupon ordinary bonds. These bonds were not convertible, even though they have the same zero-coupon feature that has been very common in Strategy’s convertible senior notes.\n\nMetaplent pulled the convertibility out into separate stock acquisition rights that were issued in the same financing package to lenders. This structure is like a synthetic zero-coupon convertible senior note, because the ordinary bonds carry no interest and the stock acquisition rights are options to purchase common stock which the lender can exercise. Metaplanet chose this structure because it was deemed to be more flexible than a normal convertible bond.\n\nSo far, the ordinary bonds plus stock acquisitions rights imitates Strategy’s zero-coupon convertible senior notes. The MSW imitates Strategy’s MSTR ATM offering.\n\nGoing further, Metaplanet’s most recent ¥555 billion shelf registration imitates Strategy’s STRK and STRF preferred shares. Strategy’s 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred (STRK) features a perpetual 8% dividend on a $100 face value, plus a conversion feature which could turn a STRK share into 1/10 share of MSTR. STRK IPOed in February and Strategy quickly opened a $21 billion STRK ATM.\n\nThe 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF) came next. STRF is senior on the capital structure and features a 10% dividend on the $100 face value. Its dividend cannot be forfeited unless Strategy is willing to pay substantial arrears in the future. Strategy calls STRF its “crown jewel” and “investment grade” credit instrument, and it opened a $2.1 billion ATM on STRF.\n\nMetaplanet’s shelf registration announced the creation of two classes of perpetual preferred shares. Class A shares rank senior in dividends and asset distributions but carry no voting rights. The class A shares are like STRF because they are senior and dividend-only.\n\nThe second type, Class B shares, rank junior and include a put option allowing holders to require conversion into common shares at prescribed times and rates. Metaplanet’s class B shares are like STRK because they are junior, include dividends, and have a feature to convert to a fixed amount of common shares. Metaplanet intends for dividends for both classes to not exceed 6%.\n\nIn summary, Metaplanet’s capital raising strategy is tracking closely with Strategy’s own. Every jurisdiction has regulatory differences which create superficial disparities for how capital raises are conducted. But if we peel back the layers, we can see that the playbook is very similar, and duplicatable.\n\nWith Metaplanet beginning to launch perpetual credit instruments, it is likely that other bitcoin treasury companies will eventually follow suit. The key to making these instruments work is the bitcoin treasury acting as collateral. Because many new bitcoin treasury companies have relatively negligent earnings to speak of, the presence of bitcoin collateral is the only thing with underlying value supporting the credit instruments. The most important takeaway about this dynamic is that the amount of credit issuance will likely be hard capped by the amount of bitcoin held by the treasury company.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:07:40.626373+00:00"}

That cost pressure typically pushes futures prices higher than spot prices, creating arbitrage opportunities for traders. The setup can fuel speculative buying, but it also sends a geopolitical signal — gold has historically been viewed as outside trade-war crossfire, more akin to a currency than a competitive product.\n\nThe move is notable because most U.S. gold imports come from Switzerland, which received one of the highest tariff rates under the policy. A sudden increase in costs for that supply could raise the risk of a short squeeze if deliveries slow.\n\n“Trump's tariffs on 100-ounce and 1-kilo gold bars could wreak havoc on the COMEX,\" bitcoin critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff said in a post on X. \"Prices could soar as shorts rush to cover to avoid having to pay 39% tariffs to import bars from Switzerland if longs take delivery. Even if they don't import, all such bars will trade at premiums.\"\n\nThe rally comes at a time when interest rates headed lower in the West and global trade tensions are already high, factors that tend to strengthen gold’s appeal as a store of value during economic uncertainty.\n\nHistorically, strong gold rallies have often coincided with gains in bitcoin, which some traders view as an alternative “safe-haven” asset. Tokenized gold products such as PAX Gold\n\nand Tether Goldwere both modestly higher over the past 24 hours, while bitcoin slipped about 1%.\n\nTariffs on gold could also make the case for bitcoin, which is not subject to customs duties and is sometimes described as “digital gold.” While the metal remains the dominant safe-haven asset, the latest price surge shows how policy changes can push investors to reassess their options.\n\nBoth spot gold prices and gold futures fell during U.S. afternoon trading on Thursday after a White House official told Bloomberg that the President would introduce a policy clarifying that imports of gold bars should not be subject to tariffs, calling earlier news \"misinformation\" regarding the tariffs.\n\nUpdate (Aug 8, 18:23 UTC) : Adds paragraph at the end about a White House official telling Bloomberg that the President will post an executive order to exempt gold bars from tariffs.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:07:42.129005+00:00"}

Sure, positive investor sentiment led to gains in bitcoin, as well as the ETF I bought that was designed to track the crypto. But my stock purchase proved ill-timed,” she wrote.\n\nTo clarify matters, Ji invested in two shares tied to BTC — Blackrock’s iShare’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), and Semler Scientific (SMLR). The latter, a healthcare tech company, merely holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a hedge, while Blackrock’s BTC ETF is tied to the crypto more closely by design.\n\nWhile IBIT performed very well (outperforming even BTC itself as a pure investment, at least by the time Ji had filed her initial report), the same couldn’t be said for Semler, which actually shed value post-investment.

Here's what investors need to know today.\n\n1. US Stock Futures Little Changed as Investors Watch for Inflation Data\n\nU.S. stock futures are little changed as investors look ahead to today's release of July inflation data. S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq futures all are near flat after the indexes closed lower in the prior session. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) price levels are down to around $118,000 after approaching all-time highs yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is little changed. Gold and oil futures are pointing slightly lower.\n\n2. CPI Expected to Show Inflation Increased in July\n\nInflation is expected to have moved higher in July when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. The CPI report is expected to show prices rose by 2.8% year-over-year last month, up from June's 2.7% reading, according to economic consensus compiled by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires. The closely watched \"core\" CPI reading is expected to have increased to 3.1% from 2.9%. The report comes days after President Donald Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics head Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report showed a surprisingly large slowdown in hiring.\n\n3. U.S. Extends Tariffs Truce With China by 90 Days\n\nThe White House on Monday extended its trade truce with China by 90 days, hours before it was set to raise tariffs on Chinese-made goods to an extreme level. Had President Trump not extended the pause, tariffs on most products from China would have risen to 145% starting Tuesday. The two sides have scaled back their mutual tariffs )though still set at elevated levels), and lifted restrictions on materials such as rare earth minerals from China and U.S.-made computer chips.\n\n4. Musk Threatens Lawsuit Against Apple Over App Store Rankings\n\nElon Musk threatened to sue Apple (AAPL) over App Store rankings of his social media network X and the Grok artificial intelligence chatbot. Musk wrote on his X social media network late Monday that its parent company, xAI, \"will take immediate legal action\" against Apple for an alleged \"antitrust violation.\" Musk, whose xAI developed the Grok AI chatbot, wrote, \"Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either 𝕏 or Grok in your 'Must Have' section when 𝕏 is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?\"\n\n5. C3.ai Stock in Focus After Plummeting on Firm's Weak Revenue Projection\n\nC3.ai (AI) shares are in focus after plunging more than 25% Monday as the AI software provider posted preliminary financial results that fell well short of the company's own expectations. C3.ai said it expects to report revenue of $70.2 million to $70.4 million for its fiscal 2026 first quarter, down from $87.2 million in revenue the same period a year earlier. In May, the company had guided for revenue of $100 million to $109 million. The former AI darling's stock has lost more than half its value since the year began.

It is a key economic metric closely followed by policymakers, businesses, and markets, and is seen as one of the most important macro events this month for both Wall Street and digital assets.\n\nA lower CPI figure could solidify expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September while a hotter inflation read may hit Fed rate cut chances and weigh on crypto markets.\n\nThe new numbers are “poised to be one of the most critical macro data releases in recent memory for risk assets,” analysts at Presto Labs wrote in a Tuesday note to investors.\n\nSeveral analysts have said they anticipate that crypto prices will soon hit record highs.\n\nBitwise, Bernstein and Standard Chartered have all predicted that Bitcoin’s price will hit $200,000 before the end of the year.\n\nEven so, Liu notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum options trades have surged to “near yearly highs” of $43 billion and $14 billion respectively.\n\n“This high open interest from derivatives traders could amplify volatility, so be cautious of short squeezes, sudden liquidations, or sharp price moves,” Liu said.\n\nThe Fed has held its benchmark rate at 4.25%–4.50% all year. Markets are pricing an 84.4% chance of a September cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

This top cryptocurrency is up 144% since April.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/12/is-this-cryptocurrency-the-biggest-winner-of-trump/", "published_at": "2025-08-12T10:09:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Maybe tariffs aren't so bad for crypto after all. This top cryptocurrency is up 144% since April.\n\nIt's now been slightly more than four months since the White House announced \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. So there's been enough time to project which cryptocurrency could be the biggest winner of Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe answer might surprise you. It's not Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which was everyone's \"flight to safety\" option during the peak of tariff uncertainty. Instead, the biggest winner of Trump's tariffs appears to be Ethereum (ETH 5.42%).\n\nPerformance of different cryptocurrencies under tariffs\n\nI've charted the performance of seven different cryptocurrencies from April 1 to August 1: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA), Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), and Sui (CRYPTO: SUI).\n\nThe performance of Ethereum jumps right off the chart. It's the clear outlier, and it's not even close. Ethereum is up a whopping 144% in that time. By way of comparison, Bitcoin is only up 39%. Two hard-charging altcoins -- XRP and Sui -- have also outperformed Bitcoin. XRP is up 56%, while Sui is up 70%.\n\nAt the same time, two cryptocurrencies -- Solana and Dogecoin -- appear to be closely tracking the performance of Bitcoin. Both are up 37%. There is only one clear underperformer. That's Cardano, which is up only 25%.\n\nBased on these numbers alone, it appears that the clear winner of Trump's tariffs is Ethereum. It has more than doubled the performance of the next-closest cryptocurrency, and it has absolutely trounced Bitcoin.\n\nDo investors need to rethink tariffs?\n\nThe tricky part is interpreting this data point. What does it mean about tariffs and their impact on cryptocurrencies? Think back to April 2, when the crypto market reacted negatively to the onslaught of unprecedented tariffs against every major trading nation. The immediate instinct of many was to pile into Bitcoin.\n\nFour months later, that investment thesis looks increasingly flawed. For one, maybe tariffs are not so bad for cryptocurrencies after all. How can anyone make the argument that tariffs are harmful for Ethereum if it's up a resounding 144%? Secondly, maybe Bitcoin is not the slam-dunk investment everyone thought it was. It's still the market benchmark, but altcoins are now outperforming it.\n\nOf course, four months is not long, and it remains to be seen what happens over the remainder of 2025. However, I've already started to recalibrate my thinking about tariffs, their impact on the economy, and their potential impact on the crypto market.\n\nWhat other factors might be at work?\n\nThere are other possible explanations for Ethereum's heroic performance over the past four months. One of these is the unprecedented growth of Ethereum treasury companies over the past few months. These companies do one thing: buy Ethereum. They raise money from investors and then turn around and plow it into Ethereum. At some point, that buying pressure has to force up the price, right?\n\nEarlier this summer, SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET) announced that it was transforming into an Ethereum treasury company. Then, in late June, Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR 14.68%) did the same. Others have since followed their lead.\n\nFor me, Bitmine is the more interesting example, and not just because it hired Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee to be its chairman. As you might have guessed from its name, Bitmine Immersion Technologies was a Bitcoin mining company. But now it's apparently ditching that business model.\n\nDoesn't that strike you as odd? It's a bit like a lifelong Yankees fan deciding to become a Red Sox fan. It's just not supposed to happen. Bitmine Immersion Technologies could be a clear signal of a significant shift in market sentiment.\n\nWhat should investors expect next?\n\nWhile Ethereum has been the biggest winner so far, its price has historically been highly correlated with that of Bitcoin. So I don't expect that type of outperformance to last forever. Most likely, the returns of Ethereum and Bitcoin will be more similar over the remaining months of 2025.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's hard not to be bullish on Ethereum right now. After a weak start to the year, it has now emerged as a legitimate contender for top-performing major cryptocurrency of the year. You really can't argue with returns of 144%.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:45.391844+00:00"}

This U.S. law, the first designed to facilitate crypto usage, could pave the way for the digital assets to become an everyday way to make payments and move money, experts said.\n\nThe use of stablecoins, designed to maintain a constant value, usually a 1:1 U.S. dollar peg, has exploded in recent years, notably among crypto traders moving funds to and from other tokens, such as bitcoin and ether.\n\nNow, a slate of companies are entertaining their own stablecoin strategies to capitalize on the promise of instant payments and settlement that stablecoins offer. Payments on traditional banking rails can take several days to arrive, or take even longer across international borders.\n\nAmong the companies considering stablecoins are Walmart and Amazon, the Wall Street Journal reported in June. Walmart and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nHowever, the new law will not immediately open the floodgates, experts said. The newfound opportunity to dabble in stablecoins can lead to numerous tricky considerations for firms, both strategic and technical.\n\nCompanies have to embark on a lengthy process to deploy their own stablecoins, or decide whether it makes more sense to integrate existing stablecoins, like issuer Circle's USDC, into their business.\n\nCompanies first have to decide the purpose of their stablecoins. For example, a retail platform could make a stablecoin available to customers to buy goods, which could appeal to crypto-savvy users. Some companies could use them internally for cross-border payments, given that stablecoins can enable near-instant payments, often with lower fees.\n\nHow a company plans to use a stablecoin could affect whether it creates a stablecoin or works with a partner.\n\n\"The intended use is going to matter a lot,\" said Stephen Aschettino, a partner at Steptoe. \"Is this something really designed to drive customers to engage with the issuer, or is the issuer's primary motivation to have a stablecoin that is more ubiquitous?\"\n\nFor nonbanks, stablecoins will bring new compliance costs and oversight requirements, given that the GENIUS Act requires issuers to comply with anti-money laundering and \"know your customer\" (KYC) requirements.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:47.387959+00:00"}

They are earned through a process called mining, which involves using computers to solve complicated mathematical problems to help validate transactions on the blockchain.\n\nBut the XRP (XRP -0.59%) cryptocurrency is different because it's issued directly by Ripple, the company that created it. This arrangement caught the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the agency sued Ripple in 2020 alleging it breached financial securities laws.\n\nThe legal battle was ongoing until last Thursday, when the SEC officially agreed to settle the case in line with President Donald Trump's pro-crypto agenda. Could this be a major upside catalyst for XRP?\n\nThe SEC finally backs off\n\nRipple developed a payment system called Ripple Payments, which allows banks to settle cross-border transactions with one another directly no matter what existing payment infrastructure they use. This eliminates the need for intermediaries (middlemen), so money can be sent around the world instantly.\n\nXRP is designed to standardize transactions through Ripple Payments. For instance, an American bank might send XRP to a French bank instead of sending U.S. dollars, which cuts out expensive foreign exchange fees. Once the French bank receives XRP, it can simply convert it into its domestic currency (the euro). The transfer would cost just 0.00001 XRP tokens, or a fraction of one U.S. cent.\n\nXRP has a total supply of 100 billion tokens, with 59.3 billion in circulation and the other 40.7 billion controlled by Ripple, which releases them as necessary to meet demand. In its lawsuit, the SEC argued that XRP should be treated like a stock, a bond, or any other financial security normally issued by a company. This would've placed Ripple under a strict regulatory framework, adding costs and restrictions that might have derailed its business model.\n\nIn August 2024, a judge ruled that XRP might only be a security when it's issued to institutions, but not when it's traded on public exchanges or used in transactions. Ripple was slapped with a $125 million penalty, but the crypto community viewed it as a win. The SEC appealed the decision, which threatened to tie the matter up in court for several more years, but then President Trump was elected.\n\nTrump promised to assemble a pro-crypto administration, and he appointed industry advocate Paul Atkins to run the SEC. The agency has paused or withdrawn several of its active cases against crypto giants like Binance and Coinbase under his leadership, and on Aug. 7, it officially withdrew its appeal against Ripple, ending a five-year legal slugfest.\n\nBut don't count on further upside for XRP\n\nXRP set a new record high in July for the first time since 2018, as an imminent resolution with the SEC was widely expected. The token also benefited from the approval of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF last month, which is a leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in XRP futures contracts. Investors consider this a stepping stone to the approval of spot XRP ETFs, the same way futures-based Bitcoin ETFs preceded spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBut I wouldn't bet on XRP moving higher over the long term. First of all, banks don't have to use it in order to benefit from instant cross-border transactions through Ripple Payments, because the network also supports fiat currencies. Therefore, the success of Ripple's platform won't necessarily translate into a higher price for XRP.\n\nSecond of all, Bitcoin is benefiting from ETFs because it's considered to be a legitimate store of value, thanks to its decentralized nature and capped supply. Investors want a safe, regulated way to buy it, and ETFs are the answer. XRP, on the other hand, doesn't have a great track record of creating value for investors -- after all, it just spent seven years trading below its previous all-time high.\n\nMoreover, since XRP is controlled by Ripple, the token's value is vulnerable to downside when the company experiences issues. The five-year legal battle with the SEC is a prime example, and remember, it's entirely possible the agency adopts a strict approach to crypto again under new government administrations in the future.\n\nTherefore, I don't think XRP has a path to sustainable upside over the long term.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:49.990897+00:00"}

The neckline of this pattern, drawn from the low of $111,982 reached during the brief pullback, is the key level to watch on the downside.\n\nA decisive move below that level would confirm the double top breakdown, potentially opening the door for a sell-off to $100,000. That level is arrived at by subtracting the gap between the twin peaks and the neckline from the neckline level in what's known as the measured move method of calculating targets.\n\nBTC's double top. (TradingView)\n\nEarly this year, BTC double-topped near $100,000, eventually falling to lows under $75,000 in early April. The double top comprises two peaks separated by a trough and takes roughly two to six weeks to form. The gap between the two peaks must be equal to or less than 5%, with the spread between peaks and the trough being at least 10%, according to technical analysis theory.\n\nThese, however, are guidelines and not rules, meaning the backdrop is more important – the pattern should appear after a prolonged uptrend to be valid, which is the case with BTC.\n\nResistance: $120,000, $122,056, $123,181.\n\n$120,000, $122,056, $123,181. Support: $114,295 (the 50-day SMA) , $111,982, $100,000.\n\nBears gain an upper hand ahead of U.S. CPI\n\nThe dual failure of Bitcoin bulls to sustain gains above $122,000 indicates a clear case of buyer exhaustion, giving bears a significant upper hand as the market heads into today's CPI release.\n\nThis exhaustion of buying pressure means the market is now particularly vulnerable to a hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation report due Tuesday. In other words, the buying momentum is not strong enough to absorb the potential selling pressure triggered by an elevated CPI and the resulting drop in the Fed rate cut bets. In this scenario, the market could experience a rapid decline.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin $115K Bets In Demand as Downside Fear Grips Market Ahead of U.S. CPI Report", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:53.014409+00:00"}

Discover SCENE\n\nSafety Shot Inc., a healthy beverage company, is set to receive $25 million worth of BONK from the founding contributors of the Solana meme coin. By the end of the year, the company aims to acquire up to $115 million worth of the Solana meme coin.\n\nIt is the latest in a long line of publicly traded companies pivoting to create crypto treasuries, first starting with Bitcoin and, more recently, expanding to the fringes of the industry.\n\nTraded on the NASDAQ under the ticker SHOT, the wellness company has slumped 92% from its all-time high of $8.88 in early 2021 to just $0.6883, according to TradingView. It currently has a market capitalization of $82.7 million. By comparison, BONK’s market cap is above $2 billion.\n\nThe move will see BONK founding contributors “deeply integrate” into the Safety Shot company. This includes pseudonymous core contributor Nom, who will be joining Safety Shot in a strategic capacity to assist with the accumulation of BONK, as well as to advise on how to operate on-chain. Exact details of this arrangement are to be announced.\n\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:0px;overflow:hidden;line-height:0\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span>\n\n“Since BONK's initial airdrop, there has been no fundraise or accessible way for many investors, traditional companies, or funds to ‘invest’ in BONK without holding the native token,” Nom told Decrypt. “This is a way to hold exposure to BONK for many in traditional accounts. It acts as a further step towards being approved in the accepted regulatory framework, solidifying a diverse set of owners of the token, and will act as a foundational part of BONK as an investable asset for the future.”\n\nAfter FTX collapsed in November 2022, Solana was in a dire state due to Sam Bankman-Fried’s public support of the blockchain. Amid the wreckage, a group decided to create BONK as a “community coin” airdropped to Solana developers and community members around Christmas time. Many believe it helped save Solana from what appeared to be certain death.\n\nSafety Shot decided to pivot to become a BONK treasury company thanks to its exclusive financial advisor, Dominari Securities, LLC., Nom told Decrypt. Dominari Securities also aided with the formation of a Tron treasury company. Nom added that the BONK treasury company had been in the works for “months,” and Monday’s $25 million announcement is just the first step.\n\nThe treasury company trend follows the success of Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which started buying up Bitcoin in 2020. Previously a middling business intelligence software company, it has since continued acquiring BTC, which has seen its stock skyrocket in value as Bitcoin broke new all-time highs.\n\nSeeing this success, several failing companies have adopted the crypto treasury strategy.\n\nMost notably, SharpLink Gaming was close to being delisted before it raised $425 million to buy Ethereum and brought in Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin to its board of directors. Its stock, SBET, surged more than 4,340% from $2.79 to $124.12 on the announcement, but has since fallen 79% to $25.70 in the months following, according to TradingView.\n\n(Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)\n\nThe argument for Ethereum treasury companies is that ETH can be used to produce yield, and trusting a group of experts to get the best yield may be worth the premium you pay. However, Nom said, this will not be the case with Safety Shot’s BONK treasury, at least at first.\n\nAt this stage, he explained, the company is focusing on acquiring approximately “4% to 5%” of the BONK supply by the end of the year, before exploring yield-generating options. At today’s prices, that would be up to $115 million worth of BONK.\n\n“There have been massive successes like Strategy and [BitMine] that are inspirations for much of these companies,” Nom said. “But as we go further down the asset list, we need to ensure the quality is as high as possible, and ensure that these companies don't become future forced sellers.”\n\nAs such, he explained, Safety Shot is expected to announce new revenue generation channels in the future. And, it's going to need it as the stock has tanked 51% in value following the announcement.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:04:27.166361+00:00"}

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nCoinbase’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 62 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 5.4% on the news that the company announced a plan to offer $2 billion in convertible senior notes. The private offering consisted of two $1 billion tranches, due in 2029 and 2032, directed at qualified institutional buyers. Investors reacted to the potential for future dilution. Dilution happens when a company issues new shares, which can decrease the ownership percentage of existing stockholders. The news extended weakness from the company's recent quarterly results, which showed a slowdown in trading activity.\n\nCoinbase is up 28.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $331.08 per share, it is still trading 21.1% below its 52-week high of $419.78 from July 2025.

Gox hack (the largest Bitcoin exchange at the time), which resulted in the of ~650,000 Bitcoin.\n\nThen there was the Silk Road marketplace, an online black market which sold drugs and used crypto as a medium of exchange. Finally, there was the FTX Exchange, which collapsed due to mismanagement and misuse of customers funds. In between each of these instances there were several smaller, yet devastating moments.\n\nNevertheless, the crypto industry has proven resilient. Today, there are 250 digital assets listed on Coinbase. Overall, there are more than 15,000 cryptocurrencies that are listed on more than 1,000 exchanges. Though the crypto industry remains a 'Wild West' in many areas, 2025 will be remembered as a banner year where crypto entered the political, institutional, and mainstream lexicon due to widespread access and formal regulation.\n\nCrypto Access to Explode Amid Trump 401(K) EO\n\n401(K) Executive Order\n\nThis week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will clear the path to allowing crypto currencies in 401(k)s and other retirement plans. The EO directs the Department of Labor to 'reexamine' past guidance that did not allow alternative assets like commodities, real estate, and crypto. Should digital assets be allowed in workplace retirement accounts it will open up crypto retirement plans to more than 70 million Americans, or more than half the US workforce.\n\nCrypto ETFs Gain Popularity as more Emerge\n\nAfter much anticipation Bitcoin ETFs finally debuted last year.

With Bitcoin trading near all-time highs and credit card debt hitting record levels nationwide, many investors are grappling with similar decisions. The Reddit thread became a battleground between two financial philosophies: conservative debt reduction versus aggressive cryptocurrency investment.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\nTrade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.\n\n“Credit card debt is toxic,” wrote one highly-upvoted commenter, echoing traditional financial wisdom. The math supports this view—with average credit card rates hovering around 21%, paying off high-interest debt provides an immediate, guaranteed return that most investments struggle to match.\n\nThe Interest Rate Threshold Strategy\n\nSeveral experienced investors proposed a nuanced approach based on interest rate thresholds. The consensus emerged around a 4.5% benchmark, matching current high-yield savings account rates. Debt above this threshold gets priority treatment, while lower-rate obligations can potentially wait.\n\n“Pay off anything above 8% immediately,” suggested one user who claimed to have managed a similar $100,000 inheritance successfully. “I reduced my monthly bills by $700 and freed up cash flow for future investments.”\n\nThis strategy acknowledges that not all debt is created equal.

Right now, that dashboard sends a very clear message: despite Bitcoin’s strong run this year, none of the key indicators are at their historical sell levels.\n\nIn a true blow-off top scenario, you’d expect to see many, if not most, of these indicators in the red zone. For example, in April 2021, the Pi Cycle Top Indicator, Puell Multiple, MVRV Z-Score, and Reserve Risk all crossed their thresholds within days of each other.\n\nAt the time of writing the dashboard reads “Hold 100%, Sell 0%” meaning zero out of the 30 indicators are flashing “sell”.\n\nSource: CoinGlass\n\nLet’s walk through a few of the more salient metrics.\n\nPie Cycle Top: The metric that nailed the last three bitcoin cycles\n\nCurrent progress: ~63% to historical top level.\n\nThe Pi Cycle Top Indicator has a cult following in Bitcoin circles because of how cleanly it has called previous market peaks. It’s based on the relationship between the 111-day moving average and double the 350-day moving average. When the shorter-term average crosses above the long-term one, it has often coincided with major cycle tops.\n\nRight now, the two lines are slowly converging. We’re well over halfway there by percentage terms but still a fair distance from the kind of compression that marks final-stage euphoria.\n\nSource: CoinGlass\n\nPuell Multiple: Follow the miners\n\nCurrent progress: ~55%\n\nAt 1.23, the Puell Multiple, which divides daily miner revenue by its 365-day moving average, is telling us miners aren’t even close to peak revenue territory.\n\nWhen miners start making at least 4x their yearly average,this often indicates unsustainable euphoria. Conversely, at the cycle bottom when bitcoin is in the dumps, bitcoin miners may become compulsory sellers when they need to cover mining operating costs.\n\nThe current Puell reading has recovered from the depths of the bear market, but it’s still well shy of historical tops. This suggests that miners aren’t in the super profitable range that historically precedes major distribution events. Mining economics have evolved recently and miners demonstrated they can stave off bear markets by leveraging capital markets so after the last halving this indicator may also need recalibration.\n\nSource: CoinGlass\n\nReserve Risk: Long-term bitcoin holder confidence\n\nCurrent progress: ~52%.\n\nThis indicator looks at the ratio between the current price and long-term holder conviction, as measured by “HODL Bank,” a cumulative metric of how long coins have been held without moving. Low risk means holders have strong conviction relative to price; high risk means conviction is low compared to the market value.\n\nCurrently it looks like holders still have substantial conviction. Near the top of a cycle, Reserve Risk spikes as long-term holders start to sell into strength.\n\nSource: CoinGlass\n\nReality check\n\nIt’s tempting to take these readings and conclude that the bull run has a long way to go. Yes, major tops experienced a convergence of many signals and we’re nowhere near that point today, but it’s also worth noting that:\n\nIndicators are backward-looking. They’re based on conditions that existed in past cycles. The presence of U.S.-listed spot ETFs, changes in miner behavior, and new global demand patterns could alter how and when these signals indicate useful information. For example, a lot of these indicators look at on-chain activity. As investors increasingly adopt bitcoin through ETFs and treasury companies, the on-chain activity becomes less useful.\n\n\n\nThey’re based on conditions that existed in past cycles.

If we knew the exact playbook, we’d all be retired on an island somewhere. But we can at least apply historical heuristics to the current cycle, and by my estimation, it looks like we go higher from here!\n\nSource: CoinGlass\n\nHeader image by Nicole Avagliano via Unsplash", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T14:10:41.410270+00:00"}

Discover SCENE\n\nOpen interest in Ethereum surged to nearly $60 billion Tuesday, with traders rushing to stake out positions on the cryptocurrency as it comes the closest it has in years to reaching a new all-time high price.\n\nEthereum last set an all time high of $4,878 back in November 2021. ETH currently sits at $4,289, up nearly 17% on the week.\n\nSome $57.31 billion in derivatives positions are currently open and pending on ETH’s future price, according to data from CoinGlass. Open interest in Ethereum futures contracts is now within range of the all-time high of $58 billion it set on July 28.\n\nTo give some sense of the significance of that figure: it represents nearly twice the value of open ETH future positions just weeks ago, in late June.\n\nIt’s also in uncommonly close striking distance of the current open interest in Bitcoin. At writing, traders have wagered $79.49 billion on the future price of BTC, the world’s top cryptocurrency.\n\nBinance is the top single source of ETH futures volume, with $12 billion of open interest in the token coming from the world’s top crypto exchange. CME is next closest, with over $7.6 billion in open ETH positions coming from the American derivatives giant.\n\nRecent liquidations data further shows that ETH is the market’s current flavor of the moment.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, over $127 million worth of ETH positions have been liquidated—the majority of which were long positions. In the same period, only $70 million worth of Bitcoin positions came due.\n\nMuch of the current excitement around ETH can be attributed to the token’s recent spike after months of lagging behind other top market players.

Discover SCENE\n\nThe price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rose Tuesday after a widely watched inflation gauge showed that U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in July.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% in the 12 months through July, according to a new U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report. Economists expected the index, which tracks price changes across a broad range of goods and services, to rise 2.8% year-over-year.\n\nConsumer prices rose 0.2% on a monthly basis, following a 0.3% increase in June, which represented the largest month-to-month increase to CPI since January.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin ticked up to $118,000 following Tuesday’s snapshot, while showing a 1.1% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Ethereum rose 3.2% to $4,300, while Solana fell 1.7% to $176, over the same period.\n\nAspects of the report pointed to underlying price pressures. Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.1% year-over-year, coming in slightly above economists' expectations. Core CPI also rose 0.3% in July, the largest month-to-month increase since January.\n\nRussell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial, noted that the CPI report is heavily weighted toward shelter prices. While they've been providing upward pressure in recent months, they showed signs of moderating in July, he told Decrypt.\n\n\"It was a good report today,\" he said. \"I think that offers a good trajectory for inflation over the near term, even though we're likely to see a little bit of upside from tariff related influences.\"\n\nTuesday’s reading follows a contentious policy meeting at the Federal Reserve, in which officials decided to hold interest rates steady for a fifth straight meeting, although two board governors called for an immediate cut. This is the first time the group has been splintered since 1993.\n\nThe Fed has been reluctant to lower its benchmark rate this year, fearing that U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs could reignite price pressures for consumers. But there have been repeated calls to lower rates from the president and criticism directed at Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nLower interest rates tend to benefit risk assets like stocks and crypto, and the odds of a rate cut in September surged following a weaker-than-expected jobs report, which included downward revisions of 258,000 total jobs in May and June earlier this month.\n\nFollowing the inflation print, traders penciled in 82.5% chance that the Fed would lower interest rates next month. The odds have fallen slightly from an 86% chance on Monday, according to CME FedWatch.\n\nIn a speech on Friday, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said that she voted for a rate cut at the Fed’s most recent policy meeting because of “signs of fragility” in the labor market, “with economic growth slowing this year and signs of a less dynamic labor market becoming clear.”\n\nShe also argued that the effect of tariffs on consumer price would be temporary, as the central bank tries to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.\n\nExperts think that Trump’s tariffs haven’t had a significant impact on inflation because of ongoing tariff exemptions with some countries and months of stockpiling goods by U.S. companies, according to Cato Institute's General Economics Vice President Scott Lincicome.\n\nIf Trump’s tariffs lead to an uptick in inflation, that may start to reflect itself in the data “sometime this fall,” as companies continue working through their stockpiles of goods, he wrote in July. And companies may have to start passing along price increases to the consumer.\n\n“Not only are the effective tariff rates rising, with more still to come, but inventories are dwindling,” he argued. “Many U.S. companies have announced price increases, and more are on the way.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T14:10:45.835316+00:00"}

Volmex's 24-hour bitcoin implied volatility index stood at an annualized 31%, easily within its recent range, equating to an expected price swing of just 1.6% in the next 24 hours. The gauges for ether (ETH) , solana\n\nand XRPshowed expected swings of 3.29%, 2.9% and 4.5%, respectively. None are out of the ordinary.\n\nStill, traders may want to remain vigilant because August is known to bring significant volatility in stocks, which could quickly spill over into the crypto market. Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, the VIX, which measures the 30-day implied volatility in the S&P 500, spiked on Aug. 1 before calming down, a pattern that has historically presaged a surge in volatility.\n\n\"Curiously the VIX made a brief spike right about when the seasonal map said it would, and then subsequently has also calmed back down right on cue,\" Callum Thomas, the founder and head of research at Topdown Charts, noted. \"The implication is that if this seasonal script-following persists then we are in for some heightened volatility in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nIt's worth remembering that volatility is price-agnostic and can unfold bullishly if the CPI prints lower than expected. That would be a positive surprise to risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nEther (ETH) might benefit the most, as it has recently led BTC higher on the back of corporate adoption.\n\n\"Ethereum, supported by institutional inflows and corporate treasury buying, has a potential path toward testing prior all-time highs if conditions remain favorable,\" XBTO's chief investment officer Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón said in an email. BTC continues to serve as an anchor, he said. In contrast, the broader market remains concentrated at the top, according to Alarcón.\n\nIn traditional markets, gold could register sharp losses in the event of hotter-than-expected CPI, as its persistent failure to stage rallies above $3,400 since April suggests bullish exhaustion.

Dogecoinand Cardanorose over 8%, continuing a tendency of following ETH price action.\n\nTraders say recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump fueled sentiment after ordering regulators to “look into” the possibility of adding crypto — alongside private equity — to U.S. 401 (k) retirement plans.\n\nWhile this prospect is currently exploratory, the possibility of retirement accounts gaining direct exposure to crypto would represent a significant structural shift in demand.\n\n“Ethereum has been the standout, with mainstream equity analysts now joining the FOMO trade,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, in a Telegram message. “BTC implied volatility remains near all-time lows while ETH’s short-dated vol has jumped materially — that’s a sign traders see more upside and near-term action in ETH.”\n\nImplied volatility (IV) is the market’s forecast of how much a crypto’s price might move in the future, based on options prices. If IV is low, traders aren’t expecting big swings and if it’s high, they’re bracing for bigger moves.\n\nShort-dated volatility refers to the implied volatility of options that expire soon, typically within days or weeks. This reflects expectations for near-term price action rather than the long-term outlook.\n\nIn this case, BTC’s IV is near record lows, indicating that traders expect its price to remain relatively stable. ETH’s short-dated volatility is jumping, which suggests that traders expect larger near-term price swings — and probably more upside — in ETH compared to BTC.\n\nRate-cut bets added fuel to the move. Markets now price a high likelihood of the Federal Reserve lowering rates before year-end, easing macro headwinds for risk assets.\n\n“Ethereum’s breakout past $4,600 reflects growing confidence in its institutional adoption,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk.\n\n“Bitcoin holding near $119,000 shows resilient demand. A dovish Fed pivot could further accelerate ETH’s outperformance, especially with ETF speculation and scaling upgrades ahead,” Ruck added.\n\nMeanwhile, FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich noted the rally is unusual in that altcoin strength appears to be pulling BTC higher, not the other way around.\n\n“Bitcoin is testing historical highs above $122,000 with the next major target at $135,000-$138,000. Ethereum is now in striking distance of its all-time high above $4,800,” he said.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:46:00.896808+00:00"}

Core Scientific (CORZ) was first to the party last June, when it announced a 12-year deal with AI cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV) .

The shares were 0.6% higher, trading around $15.76 at publication time.\n\nWhile MARA's valuation has been buoyed by bitcoin’s recent rally, treasury adoption, and exchange-traded fund-fueled inflows, risks remain.

In the past months, firms are exploring further down the risk curve, adding alternative cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets.\n\nIt’s an “alarming” trend, some say.\n\n‘Pretty bad development’\n\nAt the end of July, BitMine irked the cryptocurrency community when it announced a $1 billion stock buy back plan.\n\nInstead of accumulating Ether, the company would buy back its shares, potentially stalling the momentum for both BitMine’s share price as well as the price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nCritics said it was a “pretty bad development.”\n\nEthereum has since rallied, now trading at about $4,500 — just 10% shy from its November 2021 all-time high.\n\n‘Counterintuitively aligned’\n\nNolan reckons the buyback plan and the $20 billion raise are part of a single, counterintuitive, playbook.\n\n“This goes well with their recently announced $1b buyback plan,” Nolan told DL News.\n\n“While counterintuitive: when the NAV premium is very high, issue shares to buy Ethereum. When the NAV premium is low, or even negative, use cash to buy shares.”\n\nNAV stands for net asset value, and reflects the difference between a company’s value and the value of its underlying cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nBut NAV can cut both ways.\n\nWhen demand for a company’s shares shrivels up, the price can drop below the value of the asset it holds. This is known as a discount to NAV.\n\nIt has happened before. For instance, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which at one point traded at a 50% discount. Grayscale managed to bounce back by transforming itself into a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nAlthough the discount faded, billions exited the fund, rotating into cheaper ETFs from BlackRock or Fidelity.\n\nPecking order\n\nAdditionally, BitMine’s approach, which Nolan called cautious, offers optionality for investors, Max Shannon, senior research associate at Bitwise, told DL News.\n\n“Repurchase when undervalued, issue when overvalued, and improve the odds of sustaining a higher market NAV.”\n\nAs similar as Lee’s move to mimic Michael Saylor and purchase as much Ether as he can, the approach is setting BitMine apart, according to Nolan.\n\nThat’s because it “keeps shareholders at a higher level,” while MicroStrategy “has multiple share classes and debt obligations that mean equity holders are near the bottom on the pecking order,” Nolan said.\n\nPedro Solimano is DL News’ Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent.

Today, we are going to look at one of the less common option strategies — called a put ratio spread — and apply it to a bitcoin ETF. It allows for slightly negative action in bitcoin that can turn a profit.\n\nWhat Is a Put Ratio Spread?\n\nA put ratio spread is an advanced option trade and is generally not suitable for beginners, but it can have its place within an option portfolio.\n\nThe strategy involves buying one put option — at a higher strike price — and selling two put options at a lower strike price, both with the same expiration date.\n\nIt is generally considered a mostly neutral strategy. It has the ability to make a profit in up, down and sideways markets, but the timing is crucial for success.\n\nThe trade is placed when the trader thinks the underlying stock, or in this case the bitcoin ETF, will be stable and not drop below the short put strike at expiry.\n\nA fall in implied volatility will benefit the trade. It can also be profitable if the stock stays flat early in the trade.\n\nThe main risk with the trade is a sharp move lower early in the trade.\n\nLet's look at an example using the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT).\n\nOptions Strategy To Profit On Bitcoin\n\nOn IBIT, we could buy the Sept. 19 put with a strike price of 65 for around $2 and sell two of the Sept. 19, 60-strike puts for around 80 cents each.\n\nSince we are selling two contracts at 80 cents, or $1.60 total, but buying one at $2, the trade results in a net debit of 40 cents per share, or $40 total.\n\nThis is the maximum loss above a stock price of 65. Basically, all the puts would expire worthless, and the trader loses the $40 premium paid.\n\nThe downside risk, however, is a different story. The break-even point there is 55.40 at expiration, and losses occur if the bitcoin ETF ends up below that at expiration. In the unlikely event that IBIT went to zero, the maximum loss would be $5,540. Of course, most traders would employ a stop loss long before then.\n\nA tent-shaped profit zone exists between 55.40 and 64.60, with the maximum gain of $460 occurring at a price of 60 for IBIT at expiration.\n\nManaging The Trade\n\nThis strategy should move fairly slowly unless there is a sharp drop in the stock price. The trade starts with a delta of -2, which means it is roughly equivalent to being short two shares of IBIT, although this will change as the trade progresses.\n\nA minor pullback in bitcoin gives the ideal scenario. A big move forward isn't a disaster, though. The losses would be minimal.\n\nIn terms of a stop loss, I would close the trade if it was down $120 to $150.\n\nAccording to the IBD Stock Checkup, IBIT has a Relative Strength Rating of 91.\n\nPlease remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\n\nThis article is for educational purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin was actually down 0.4% over the same stretch.\n\nEthereum's token is rising today thanks to news of increasing support from large buyers. BitMine Immersion Technologies announced that it plans on issuing an additional $20 billion worth of stock and using the funds from the sale to purchase more Ethereum.\n\nEthereum rises on crypto treasury strategy developments\n\nBitMine Immersion submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) detailing plans to increase the total value of its planned stock sales by $20 billion.

Many of the market's leading stablecoins are built on Ethereum's network, and increasing adoption for these tokens has the potential to be a powerful demand catalyst for Ethereum's token.

It is continually undertaking strategic growth initiatives like launching the Base app and CFTC-regulated perpetual futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ether, adding DEX trading to its app for U.S. users and joining traditional finance with crypto, among others, to tap the crypto boom.

The 50-day SMA is a key indicator for traders and analysts to identify support and resistance levels. It is considered particularly important as it is the first marker of an uptrend or downtrend.\n\nShares of Robinhood Markets HOOD and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

Robinhood continues to diversify its product base to acquire new clients and gain market share.\n\n\n\nInteractive Brokers is known for its advanced electronic trading platforms and global market access. The company leverages proprietary systems to automate nearly every aspect of the brokerage process — from trade execution and risk management to compliance and customer onboarding —enabling it to operate with minimal human intervention and significantly lower costs than traditional brokers.\n\nFactors to Note for COIN Stock\n\nCoinbase, America’s largest registered crypto exchange, stands to gain from increased volatility and rising prices in the crypto asset market. Yet, in the second quarter of 2025, it suffered due to lower trading activity and subdued crypto volatility. COIN’s earnings missed expectations for the first time in the last 10 reported quarters.\n\n\n\nCoinbase stands to gain from strengthened banking relationships, the securing of new licenses and the introduction of customized products for diverse customer segments. With a clear growth strategy, the company is increasing its market share in both the U.S. spot and derivatives markets, broadening its product suite and expanding its presence globally. A strong liquidity position enables continued strategic investments aimed at enhancing offerings and driving sustainable growth.\n\n\n\nThe accelerating adoption of stablecoins is poised to further boost revenues. Coinbase has posted positive EBITDA for eight consecutive quarters, supported by the durability of its subscription-based model. Dedicated to bringing crypto utility to a global audience, the company aspires to onboard more than a billion people into the crypto economy. To advance this goal, it is channeling significant investment into core infrastructure and platforms, including Layer 2 technologies, its Base network and stablecoin development.\n\n\n\nCoinbase is a fundamentally strong company. It ended 2024 with $9.3 billion in resources, which is defined as cash & cash equivalents and USDC, up $3.8 billion year over year. Debt has been decreasing over the past several quarters, while the total debt capital ratio has been improving. Also, its higher times interest earned implies that the company can comfortably service its debt.

As of June 30, the company held 100 BTC worth $11.5 million, a 666% increase compared to a year ago.\n\nRevenue rose 6% year-over-year to $172 million, as a result of increased kiosk deployment and a higher median transaction size among customers exchanging cash for Bitcoin, the firm said.\n\n﻿\n\nBitcoin Depot’s stock price fell 14.4% on Tuesday to $4.14, according to Yahoo Finance.

In blockchains secured by proof-of-work algorithms, that's the same method used by Bitcoin, that level of control can allow an attacker to rewrite transaction history, block transactions or carry out double-spend attacks.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .\n\nIn a blog post, Quibic described the takeover as an \"experiment\" that was a \"strategic, and at times combative, application of game theory.\"\n\nDevelopers, miners and security experts are now debating whether the network’s decentralization is as robust as many believed.\n\nWhat is a 51% attack?\n\nIn a proof-of-work blockchain, miners compete to add new blocks of transactions to the chain. If one group controls more than half of the total computing power, they can outpace every other participant.\n\nThat level of control opens the door to a range of capabilities that can undermine confidence in the network. These include chain reorganizations, commonly abbreviated to \"reorg,\" which involves replacing previously confirmed blocks with new ones. It also covers double spends, meaning sending the same token twice,\n\nArguably the most impactful part of a 51% attack is censoring transactions —preventing some payments from being confirmed — which is particularly pertinent in the case of Monero given its focus on privacy\n\nThese attacks are not theoretical. Ethereum Classic was hit several times in 2020, costing millions. Bitcoin Gold faced similar incidents in 2018 and 2020. Smaller tokens like Verge have been targeted and destabilized.\n\nWhy Monero is still at risk\n\nMonero uses the RandomX algorithm to discourage mining using application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) , encouraging CPU mining instead. This design was meant to keep the network decentralized. That is why Qubic’s rapid rise is so significant. From less than 2% of Monero’s hashrate in May, it grew to more than 25% by late July, and now claims to have crossed the 51% threshold.\n\nQubic runs a “useful proof-of-work” system that turns Monero mining rewards into USDT, then uses those funds to buy and burn its own QUBIC tokens. The mechanism is unusual, combining a mining strategy with a token supply sink. And it has steadily increased Qubic’s control over Monero’s hashpower.\n\nQubic just reached 51% share of Monero. This is a huge feat. They will be the first to manipulate a cryptocurrency with a 51% attack. They intend to orphan all blocks from every other miner, making themselves the only mining entity of Monero. The only way to mine Monero will be… pic.twitter.com/rIihj5CtPo — Caffeinated User | ꓘ & ױ (@CaffeinatedUser) August 11, 2025\n\nLedger CTO Charles Guillemet said that \"sustaining this attack is estimated to cost $75 million per day,\" before adding that while it is potentially lucrative, \"it threatens to destroy confidence in the network almost overnight. Other miners are left with no incentive to continue.\"\n\nBitMEX research added: \"Qubic say the end goal is to takeover all the block rewards of Monero, which essentially means full and sustained selfish mining. It is not clear whether they can actually achieve that. If this can be achieved, the value of the coin may fall.\"\n\nIt did. Monero's XMR is currently trading at $252, down 6% over the past 24 hours to compound a 13.5% decline over the past seven days.\n\nWhat does this mean for Monero?\n\nIn the blog post, Qubic said the takeover was not about breaking Monero, but about proving that economic incentives and a coordinated mining strategy can give a smaller protocol effective control over a much larger one.\n\nThe experiment, Qubic says, was to test whether mining resources could be profitably diverted from a target network into another protocol’s economic loop.\n\nAt its peak, Qubic claims its Monero mining was nearly three times more lucrative than traditional Monero mining. A restructuring of its reward system, approved by its community, boosted payouts to its validators and drew miners away from other Monero pools.\n\nQubic has reached over 51% of Monero's hashrate, effectively giving it control of the network.\n\n\n\nQubic chose not to launch the takeover yet, proving a powerful theory by action.\n\n\n\nBut this story isn’t over yet. What's next for Qubic and the future of PoW chains?\n\n\n\nArticle below⏬ pic.twitter.com/JqQNqpy95j — Qubic (@_Qubic_) August 12, 2025\n\nQubic’s first push for majority control was met with sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks that disrupted peripheral services for over a week but failed to take down its core network.\n\nThose DDOS attacks continued on Tuesday, Ivancheglo revealed on X, in what he decribes as \"Monero Maxis returning the favor.\"\n\nQubic claims it has so far stopped short of fully taking over consensus, citing concerns about the potential impact on XMR’s price.\n\nAre other blockchains vulnerable to attack?\n\nBitcoin’s hashrate is so high that a 51% attack would be prohibitively expensive. But mid-tier proof-of-work coins are more vulnerable. The cost of gaining majority hashpower on Monero, Ethereum Classic or Bitcoin Gold is far lower.\n\nPrivacy-focused coins face an added challenge.

Real estate, unlike stocks or other assets, is very illiquid, and it can be difficult for investors to get their money out of a property if they need cash quickly.\n\nDalio's conservative advice on real estate investing related closely to other strategies he's outlined for weathering a US debt spiral. Dalio said at an event in July that the most important things one can do are to hedge portfolios against inflation and diversify holdings.\n\nHe has also suggested that investors should consider allocating 15% of their portfolio for either gold or bitcoin to protect against economic risks, although he said he prefers gold over crypto.\n\nIn July, Dalio made it clear that he believes the US is running out of time to take action that could help it avert economic disaster. Reducing the deficit is possible but not likely, leading him to raise grave concerns about the direction of the US economy.\n\n\"If the US doesn't cut the deficit to 3% of the GDP, and soon, we risk facing an economic heart attack in the next three years.\" he said in July.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:46:59.837618+00:00"}

We are keeping an eye on shares of AMC Strategy and C3 AI. Starting with AMC Entertainment, pairing earlier gains but still in the green after reporting second quarter earnings that beat revenue expectations. The movie theater chain is benefiting from big US blockbusters like the Minecraft movie and Lilo and Stitch, citing a 26% jump in attendance. AMC is seeing a recovering box office on the back of stronger consumer demand. Revenue grew 35% year over year, and still with me is Hope King. And Hope, I've been tracking the Hollywood movie business for some time, and it's been really interesting to see this post-pandemic recovery, but this year in particular feels like a turning point for a lot of these companies, especially with that theater attendance. I mean, 26% year-over-year jump is no joke.\n\n00:57 Hope King\n\nNo, it's no joke. Uh, that is because movies are back. So there is something to actually watch when you go. For me, the big story was premium. There was so much emphasis in their results on the premium auditoriums operating at nearly three times the occupancy of regular auditoriums. What does that mean? It costs way more these days to go to the movie theaters. So if you are going, especially here in New York, you're spending at least $50 between two people getting those seats and your popcorn, and these theaters are capitalizing on the demand for premium seating, demand for movies that you need to watch in theaters, like an F1, like these big blockbusters that you just mentioned. And so the key, I think, for these theaters going forward is to capitalize on people who can pay up and having movies again worth going to theaters for.\n\n02:06 Seana Smith\n\nYeah, I saw F1 at IMAX and it definitely was worth it. And and also, even though it's becoming a little more expensive to go to the movies, it's a relatively cheap option for families outside of some of the other types of entertainment out there. So something to continue to watch here, but moving on to another stock we have our name on, Strategy. Shares are climbing today, boosted by a surge in Bitcoin prices and some recent regulatory progress in the crypto space. The Michael Saylor-led company is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The company just added another 155 tokens that brings its total holdings to nearly 629,000 Bitcoin. Crypto stocks are also getting a lift following a recent executive order from President Trump that allows 401K plans to include cryptocurrencies. And look, we know strategy is one company that continuously leans on Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, he wrote on social media, quote, \"If you don't stop buying Bitcoin, you won't stop making money.\" So he's just continuing to be bullish on the crypto.\n\n03:29 Hope King\n\nI mean, I think opening this market, nearly $9 trillion market for 401K plans to use crypto is giving this boost, and I think any company that has ties to crypto, to Bitcoin, to digital assets, follow the policy, you'll follow the money, you'll follow the stock. There's usually a correlation, or at least a connection between when they hit their highs and when the actual policies are announced, and when these new, really, you know, like life-changing opportunities for people who've never been able to invest on their own, giving that over to professional money managers to actually look at their portfolios and see what they can do versus having to figure it out on your figuring it out on your own. I think that's a big benefit, I think, for the entire crypto industry.\n\n04:33 Seana Smith\n\nYeah, and strategy started really aggressively buying Bitcoin around 2020, and since that time, we've just seen this cryptocurrency rip higher. So, um, potentially, maybe more bullish moves ahead. And also, C3 AI, that's plunging after reporting preliminary quarterly results set to come in 33% below its previous guidance. DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria says the results were catastrophic in a note that downgraded the once AI darling to an underperform. The company is currently working to find a new CEO following Tom Siebel stepping down due to health reasons. Luria says that leadership changes will spell more disruption for C3 AI, and like I just said, this was an AI darling. Now we're seeing the stock just absolutely take a tumble. Seems like though this could be a company specific story and not really a problem for the AI trade at large.\n\n05:34 Hope King\n\nYeah, I think the story here is keyman risk. And you've got the founder and CEO saying that because he wasn't as involved in selling, that that's why they've seen such dramatic decline. I think that is a warning sign to all companies. If you are founder led that you are the person setting the pace and setting the sales strategy, and setting the relationships. Uh, I can't help but think about what Salesforce did at the end of last year saying from Mark Benioff, the CEO, that they were increasing their sales force to be able to get AI products out there. If you are, you know, a C3 AI and you're going up against a sales force with a 2,000 man sales force going out there to sell AI products, you are in a lot of trouble. So it is both a company issue, but also industry wide. More people need to be out there selling AI products.\n\n06:48 Seana Smith\n\nYeah, and with the losses that we're seeing today, that brings the year-to-date decline over 50% lower, and we will be seeing full results and updated guidance on September 3rd.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:47:08.933815+00:00"}

That's when it began trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $69 a share. But despite that jump, some investors may still be unclear on exactly what the company does. Here to break it down for us, we're bringing back Yahoo Finance Senior Markets Reporter, Anès Ferrey. So Anès, can you explain Circle's business model and why investors are so excited about it?\n\n00:37 Anès Ferrey\n\nYeah, that's right, Ali. And this all circles back to, no pun intended there, to their stable coin, the USD coin which they issue, which this company issues. This is, uh, a coin that is backed by the US dollar. And what, what uh, Circle does is for every stable coin that it issues, it holds a reserve on that. So it will hold most of its reserves are in, uh, short-term Treasury bills, T bills. And what the company does is it earns interest on those reserves. So, if you see that interest on the T bills going higher, this is a good thing for stable coin. Um, as far as other ways that the company makes money, it also has transaction fees that it charges, as well as services fees, especially for enterprise clients. And then you also have other services that the company provides like institutional minting. They also have reserving, redemption, uh, foreign exchange services. So, there's a myriad but really that interest income is what it uh, is is the most important as far as revenue for this company is concerned. And there are two main issuers of stable coin. You mentioned Tether earlier. That is the big one. It is used a lot abroad, uh, the Tether stable coins. But in this case, uh, Circle is is really sort of the runner up. And the reason why Wall Street is so bullish on the stock is simply because if these issuers are big buyers of uh, short-term Treasury bills, this creates demand because if stable coin is adopted more and more, which is what Wall Street is expecting, then this will create demand for short-term Treasury bills. And thus the government will want to work with stable coin issuers because it's a big buyer of their debt.\n\n04:05 Speaker A\n\nAnd Anès, Circle is reporting earnings on Tuesday for the first time as a publicly traded company. What are you watching?\n\n04:16 Anès Ferrey\n\nYeah, so we're going to be watching what they report. According to Bloomberg data, Wall Street the consensus is for them to post an adjusted loss per share of 8 cents with revenue of $647 million. In their S1 filing, they have talked about their revenue jumping year over year. And what analysts are really going to be paying attention to is what it's, what the company is expecting as far as distribution growth, expanding their distribution. And now that the Genius Act has been passed and put into law, and this creates really guardrails for the stable coin industry, what this means for the company, especially given that there are Wall Street analysts that have sort of sounded the alarm about the growing risk about two things. One is, if the Fed starts lowering rates, what will that mean for income for the, for a company like Circle? And then uh, the other one being the increased competition, because you will have increased competition with respect to stable coins, and what is Circle doing uh, as far as that increased competition. But make no mistake, I mean, a lot of Wall Street is very bullish on this stock because they really see Circle as a pure play because this is a company, publicly traded company. Tether is not, and so this is the way that investors can sort of get in on the stable coin action.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:47:11.170058+00:00"}

In the early days, this digital asset flew under the radar. It was mainly viewed as a fun project for so-called \"cypherpunks\" who were interested in individual freedoms and a new financial order.\n\nThings have evolved drastically. Bitcoin now carries a market cap of $2.3 trillion, and it seems everyone is following its every move these days. That's not surprising, given that it has been without a doubt one of the best assets any investor could've owned. In the past decade, Bitcoin has soared 41,320% (as of Aug. 5).\n\nMaybe the future still presents upside for patient investors. Where will the world's most valuable cryptocurrency be in 10 years?\n\nContinuation of trends\n\nInstead of trying to accurately predict the future, investors might be better served by looking at the present clearly. This perspective will make some trends stand out.\n\nBitcoin will continue to attract larger pools of capital. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs provided a compliant way for hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and endowments to all get in on the action.\n\nThe regulatory backdrop has gotten much more favorable for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry. For instance, the White House set up a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Other countries could adopt a friendly view, too.\n\nMoreover, the ecosystem surrounding Bitcoin keeps expanding. It's not just related to payments, although there are exciting things happening in these areas, such as the lightning network. Within financial services, Bitcoin can now be used as collateral for mortgages.\n\nBlock is innovating when it comes to hardware. The fintech enterprise sells a user-friendly Bitcoin wallet called Bitkey. And under the Proto brand, it's developing equipment to support mining decentralization. Over time, there will surely be more companies building new products and services that boost Bitcoin's adoption.\n\nOver the next decade, these notable trends are likely to continue, which should propel Bitcoin's price.\n\nBitcoin should keep rising\n\nBitcoin stands out among the sea of cryptocurrencies. And this will bode well for its future.\n\nFirst, it's easily the most recognizable blockchain network on the planet. That's the result of being the first cryptocurrency, with the highest market cap. This leads to deep liquidity and a powerful network effect, where the addition of more stakeholders, like users, nodes, miners, and developers, makes Bitcoin more valuable over time.\n\nScarcity is Bitcoin's most important characteristic. Written in its software is a hard supply cap of 21 million units, with a pre-determined inflation rate that's enforced by a halving schedule.\n\nThe world is waking up, realizing how valuable it is to own something with a finite supply. In this way, Bitcoin is far superior to fiat currencies. Take the U.S. dollar, which is constantly being debased. In the past 15 years, the M2 money supply in the U.S., which counts physical cash in circulation and money in checking accounts and easily accessible savings accounts, has exploded from $8.6 trillion to $22 trillion. This trend has no end in sight.\n\nAny investor who has a time horizon of at least a decade should consider having some of their diversified portfolio's assets allocated to Bitcoin. I'm confident that by 2035, the digital asset's price will be significantly higher. But to be clear, Bitcoin certainly won't register the same gain that it did in the past 10 years. As it becomes more mature, the potential upside will naturally diminish.\n\nComparing Bitcoin to gold makes sense. The precious metal's market cap of $23.1 trillion is 10 times more valuable than Bitcoin's $2.3 trillion. I don't think it's unreasonable for the crypto to reach gold's value in 10 years. This would translate to a 25.9% annualized gain, much lower than Bitcoin's historical returns. However, this kind of return should easily outperform the stock market if it indeed comes to fruition.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:47:15.176861+00:00"}

Discover SCENE\n\nStandard Chartered has raised its Ethereum price target to $25,000 by 2028, a major shift from March forecasts that predicted a structural decline for the world's second-largest crypto.\n\nThe UK banking giant made a massive revision on its Ethereum outlook, now projecting $7,500 by the end of 2025, $12,000 in 2026, $18,000 in 2027, and $25,000 in both 2028 and 2029, up from its earlier $4,000 target for 2025.\n\n\"We raise our price forecasts, as the backdrop for ETH has improved dramatically in recent months,\" the bank's Global Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, wrote.\n\nHe noted how institutional buying has occurred at nearly double the pace of Bitcoin accumulation during peak periods.\n\nKendrick pointed to treasury companies and Ethereum ETFs purchasing 3.8% of all circulating ETH since June, the US GENIUS Act clearing regulatory pathways for stablecoins, and planned network upgrades as key drivers behind the bullish revision.\n\nStandard Chartered calls the legislation a “pivotal change” that will boost liquidity, fuel DeFi growth, and drive ETH demand, given stablecoins already account for 40% of blockchain fees and are mostly issued on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is at $4,713.37, marking an 6% daily and 30% weekly gain. That price puts it just shy of its November 2021 all-time high of $4,878, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe odds that Ethereum climbs past its all-time high to $5,000 this year have jumped 39% in the past day on Myriad Markets.

Perplexity Offers to Buy Google's Chrome for $34.5B, Report Says\n\nAI startup Perplexity is offering to buy Google's Chrome in an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The bid would be larger than Perplexity's estimated value of $18 billion, the report said. The reported offer comes as Google faces uncertainty from an antitrust ruling that could be announced as soon as this week, with a federal judge set to decide what steps Google must take after the company was found to have maintained an illegal monopoly in search. Forcing a sale of Chrome could be part of the decision, something the Department of Justice pushed for last year.

The market’s reaction to Tuesday’s hotter-than-expected U.S. core CPI report suggests a growing number of investors now share that view.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.

The Fed has only once cut interest rates when core inflation was above 3%.\n\nEven so, bitcoin\n\nrose by over 1% on Wednesday, and ether, often envisaged as an internet bond, jumped by over 8%. U.S. stocks also rallied as traders seemingly disregarded the inflation number and continued to price in a September rate cut.\n\nThis dynamic suggests that the 2% inflation target is likely dead. The U.S. Treasury Secretary said Tuesday that the Fed should consider a 50 basis-point cut in September.\n\nThis scenario is bullish for assets with inflation-hedge appeal, such as bitcoin and gold, as it implies that central banks are willing to overlook higher inflation to cut rates.\n\nBTC recently traded near $120,000, while gold remained lackluster between $3,300 and $3,400. Several alternative cryptocurrencies posted gains in excess of 10% as retail investors flocked to cheaper coins.\n\n\"Bitcoin's current rally reveals a structural shift in crypto market participation that could define this cycle,\" Will K, CEO of decentralized trading platform VOOI and Co-Founder of Symbiosis.Finance, told CoinDesk. \"While institutions gained exposure through ETFs, retail traders are quietly returning to DeFi platforms that have removed previous barriers to entry.\"\n\nThis dual-sided crypto adoption has changed the market composition, where institutional capital flows through regulated products and sophisticated retail re-engages through evolved decentralized infrastructure.\n\n\"Traders are no longer choosing between traditional and decentralized markets, they're using both simultaneously,\" K said.\n\nSpeaking of adoption, USDC issuer Circle unveiled its stablecoin-focused layer 1 blockchain, Arc. The blockchain focus on financial transactions: payments, currency exchange and capital markets. Nasdaq-listed ALT5 Sigma completed a $1.5 billion registered direct offering and private placement led by World Liberty Financial.\n\nIn traditional markets, the MOVE index, which measures implied volatility in U.S. Treasury notes, fell to its lowest level since January 2022.

Key support sits at $0.74 if momentum fades.\n\nDerivatives Positioning\n\nEther's (ETH) price rise is accompanied by fresh capital inflows into CME-listed futures, where open interest in standard contracts sized at 50 ETH has increased to 1.85 million ETH, up from 1.5 million ETH just over a week ago.\n\nTraders appear to be positioning for an upside as the annualized three-month basis has topped 10%. In bitcoin's (BTC) case, CME basis remains near 7.5%.\n\nThe altcoin market shows no signs of overheating despite ether surging toward record highs. That's evident from perpetual funding rates on offshore exchanges, which remain pinned near annualized 10% for most major tokens.\n\nOpen interest in privacy-focused Monero XMR $ 256.11\n\nOn Deribit, ether traders chased calls at strike $5,000 and higher in a sign of bullish market sentiment. ETH calls traded at a premium relative to puts across all tenors. Still, ether's 30-day implied volatility index, ETH DVOL, remained pinned in recent ranges around 70%.\n\nBTC's implied volatility also remained relatively steady.

The goal is to align with and adapt to domestic fixed income demand, positioning bitcoin as a credible form of collateral in Japan’s capital markets.\n\nThe second initiative involves building a bitcoin-backed yield curve in the Japanese fixed income market. This would create a framework for pricing BTC-collateralized credit instruments, offering institutional investors a new way to gain exposure to Bitcoin while generating predictable yields.\n\nAs of mid-August, Metaplanet holds 18,113 BTC worth about $1.85 billion, making it the sixth largest corporate bitcoin holder in the world.

Because the vast majority of companies are beating earnings and revenue expectations. With inflation contained and a Fed rate cut likely in September, investors remain optimistic. However, some analysts warn that overvalued tech stocks may signal a potential market correction. Global markets mostly rose today, while Bitcoin declined.\n\nS&P 500 futures moved up this morning after the index closed at another all-time high yesterday, hitting 6,445.76. With inflation largely under control, investors appear to be assuming that the U.S. Federal Reserve will deliver a 0.25% interest rate cut in September. Some analysts think that if the labor market continues to slow down, the cut might be 0.5%.\n\nRegardless, the hope of incoming cheaper money is good for stocks.\n\nMaybe … too good for stocks?\n\nSome analysts think the market is heavily overvalued and thus due for a correction. The S&P’s value is heavily driven by tech stocks, according to Apollo Management, and on one measure, those stocks are more overvalued today than their equivalents were in the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. That bubble burst in 2000, and the index did not regain a new high until 2006.\n\nBut there’s another reason that traders continue to favor stocks. The fact is, companies are doing really well, according to JPMorgan. Seventy-six percent of the companies reporting their Q2 results so far have beaten earnings estimates, and 77% have beaten revenue estimates, according to Dubravko Lakos-Bujas. Sixty-two percent have been double-beats.\n\nEighty-nine percent of the S&P 500 has reported Q2 earnings so far, and their average revenue growth is 6.1% over the prior year. Their net income growth is 10.9%, Lakos-Bujas says.\n\nWith companies overperforming versus expectations, and a September rate cut looking inevitable, it is not surprising that investors are buying into the action.\n\nHere’s a snapshot of the action prior to the opening bell in New York:\n\nS&P 500 futures ticked up 0.2% this morning, premarket, after the index closed up 1.13% yesterday.\n\nSTOXX Europe 600 was up 0.49% in early trading.\n\nThe U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.16% in early trading.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 was up 1.3%, another all-time high.\n\nChina’s CSI 300 was up 0.79%.\n\nThe South Korea KOSPI was up 1.08%.\n\nIndia’s Nifty 50 was up 0.69%.\n\nBitcoin declined to $119.9K.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T14:37:08.505823+00:00"}

Ethereum’s network activity is also surging — daily transactions hit 1.74M on Aug. 6 (the highest since May 2021), monthly volumes topped 46 million, and staked ETH now accounts for over 15% of total supply. These factors make the case for a sustained demand above $4,000.\n\nInstitutional Treasuries and ETF Inflows\n\nCorporate Ethereum treasuries are rapidly expanding.

Standard Chartered projects that treasuries could expand to 10% of circulating supply over time, potentially injecting another $50 billion of demand, as quoted on tradingnews.com.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted nearly $5B in net inflows over the past month, outperforming Bitcoin ETFs proportionally and creating a solid long-term support base, as mentioned on the same source.\n\nMacro, Regulatory, and Network Tailwinds\n\nA 90% probability of a U.S. Fed rate cut in September is boosting risk assets, including Ethereum. On the regulatory side, possible SEC approval for staking within U.S. spot ETH ETFs could unlock more opportunities.\n\nOn July 17, 2025 BlackRock also filed with the SEC to include staking in its ETHA exchange-traded fund (ETF), which also boosted the sentiment for crypto’s second-largest coin.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade has unlocked over 24 million staked ETH, improving liquidity dynamics, while layer-2 adoption on networks such as Polygon and Optimism has surged, jointly processing over 20 million transactions in July.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) like 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF CETH, Vaneck Ethereum ETF ETHV, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF QETH, Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF ETHE and iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ETHA added about 50% each over the past month.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Discover SCENE\n\nTwo Estonian men who orchestrated a \"massive cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme\" have been sentenced to 16 months behind bars, ordered to complete 360 hours of community service, and fined $25,000 each.\n\nBut prosecutors requested a 10-year prison term for Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turõgin, who ran HashFlare. The Department of Justice said it's examining whether to appeal the ruling.\n\nHashflare promised victims a share of profits from a crypto mining operation. Prosecutors said its customers were shown fictitious returns on \"fake online dashboards,\" and the company lacked the infrastructure to mine in the first place.\n\nIt's claimed the pair bought Bitcoin through exchanges to reimburse early users who requested withdrawals, giving the company a sheen of legitimacy.\n\nHashFlare's sales exceeded $577 million between 2015 and 2019, with the duo using investor funds to buy real estate and high-end cars.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, hundreds of thousands of people around the world fell victim to the scheme.\n\nInvestigators have managed to seize assets worth more than $450 million, which will be shared among those who lost money by investing in HashFlare.\n\nDigital assets, real estate, vehicles and mining equipment were seized by law enforcement agencies around the world—and details of the claims process for victims \"will be announced at a later date.\"\n\nPotapenko and Turõgin have been sentenced to 16 months behind bars, ordered to complete 360 hours of community service, and fined $25,000 each.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller said the pair had operated \"a classic Ponzi scheme,\" with victims suffering \"a serious impact on their financial and emotional well-being.\"\n\n\"They diverted millions of dollars to their own benefit, purchasing their own Bitcoin, real estate, luxury cars, expensive jewelry, and more than a dozen trips on chartered private jets,\" she added.\n\nPotapenko and Turõgin are going to be deported to Estonia to serve their terms of supervised release, and the FBI has set up a dedicated page on its website for anyone who believes they may be a victim of HashFlare.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T14:37:12.276819+00:00"}

By manipulating the pool’s math — often through self-trading or over-weighted deposits — they made the token appear far more valuable in BTC terms.\n\nThey then withdrew liquidity, receiving large amounts of real BTC at the fake price, draining 58.2 BTC from the pool.\n\nThis pump-and-drain worked because automated market makers rely purely on internal supply ratios, not external price checks, making them vulnerable when pools are shallow or poorly secured.\n\nBodily said the incident involved multiple threat actors, many tied to Chinese groups, working in coordination to exploit the flaw. The breach was first flagged by a community member who noticed the unusual liquidity movements, prompting an immediate freeze on suspicious accounts.\n\nWhile the platform’s remaining funds are “safe,” Bodily admitted Odin’s treasury isn’t large enough to fully absorb the losses, forcing the team to prepare what he called a “concrete plan” to compensate affected users.\n\n“We have ideas… we’ll share details as soon as they are finalized,” he said on X, adding that the plan is being shaped alongside a full audit from a security firm in a process expected to take up to a week.\n\nThe Odin.fun team has contacted U.S. law enforcement and is coordinating with Binance and OKX, both of which have engaged Chinese authorities to track and potentially freeze the stolen funds.\n\nRead more: Indian Crypto Exchange CoinDCX Suffers $44M Hack", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T14:37:13.824587+00:00"}
