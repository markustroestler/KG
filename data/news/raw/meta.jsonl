This was on full display Tuesday with Meta (META) and Palantir (PLTR) rising more than 2% to close at record highs.\n\nMeta stock rose 0.3% in premarket trading on Wednesday and Palantir climbed 0.7%.\n\n\"Investors are back to their usual embrace of US large cap Tech stocks over large caps in general and the move is not yet overdone,\" DataTrek Research co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote in a Tuesday research note.\n\nRabe highlighted how the top 20 stocks by market cap in the index have risen an average of 40.6% since the bottom, far outpacing the benchmark index's 27.9% gain over the same time period. This means the top 20 holdings have helped pull the index higher, while the other 480 stocks have been \"a net drag\" on the index in relative terms.\n\nNearly all of the names in the group that have outperformed the S&P 500 index — which includes Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Meta, Broadcom (AVGO), Tesla (TSLA), JPMorgan (JPM), Netflix (NFLX), Oracle (ORCL), and Palantir — have some sort of AI growth story attached to the stock story.\n\n\"Ultimately, Tech companies that leverage disruptive innovation — such as gen AI — drive US equity returns,\" Rabe wrote.\n\nAnd when looking at the market's rebound on a sector basis, there's an AI tilt. Only Information Technology (XLK) and Industrials (XLI) have outperformed the index since the market bottom.\n\nCiti US equity strategist Scott Chronert, who recently raised his year-end S&P 500 target to 6,600, told Yahoo Finance the Industrials rally is really just an extension of the AI trade, as those companies benefit from increased AI spending.\n\n\"You're seeing this broader AI influence really permeate the index at a bigger level than just tech,\" Chronert said.\n\nAnd Chronert believes the longer-term opportunity in the market remains in identifying companies that will eventually benefit from AI boosting margins and productivity within their businesses.\n\n\"We're still probably early innings in terms of the AI infrastructure buildout,\" Chronert said. \"The bigger, longer term play is going to be more companies incorporating AI to better get their own company production and profitability metrics sort of in their own strategic up and to the right pattern.\"", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:51.839175+00:00"}

So severe was the drop in some stocks that many continue to lag the performance of the S&P 500 in 2025 despite dramatic recoveries.\n\nFortunately, a few have managed to outperform the index. Moreover, some even remain solid buys. Investors looking for AI stocks that can continue to perform should consider these names.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nIn a sense, the performance of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%) may not come as a surprise. The company dominates advanced semiconductor manufacturing, as competitors such as Samsung and Intel failed to match its technical prowess.\n\nConsequently, top chip design companies such as Nvidia and Apple outsource most manufacturing to TSMC, which holds a 68% market share in the third-party foundry market. Since such companies cannot run AI workloads without its chips, TSMC is one of the most essential companies in the AI industry.\n\nSo, it is little wonder that Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI chip industry of 29% through 2030. This means that doubts about the economy are much less likely to affect TSMC.\n\nIndeed, one can find little that is sluggish about TSMC's performance. In the first half of 2025, it generated nearly $56 billion in revenue, a 40% increase from year-ago levels. Over the same period, costs and expenses rose 24%. Thus, its net income of almost $24 billion was 60% higher than in the first two quarters of 2024.\n\nIt sells at a P/E ratio of 28. That valuation is unlikely to deter investors, considering its rapid growth, and should translate into gains for TSMC stock over time.\n\nUpstart Holdings\n\nThe fact that Upstart Holdings (UPST 0.02%) is a market beater so far in 2025 may come as a surprise. Its stock lost 19% of its value following Q2 earnings. Additionally, it had posted net losses for years before the current quarter. At one point in the 2022 bear market, it had even lost 97% of its value.\n\nNonetheless, Upstart is worth following, especially considering its ability to transform the credit scoring market. Fair Isaac's FICO score, the industry standard, has not had a major update since 1989.\n\nIn contrast, Upstart's model leverages AI to consider attributes overlooked by FICO. It trained its model on over 90 million data points and is working to increase its advantage in AI during the year. Such efforts have helped it uncover loan opportunities overlooked by FICO without adding to lender default risks.\n\nMoreover, amid a sluggish economy, the Fed appears poised to lower interest rates, which should encourage more consumers to take out loans. So far, it mainly scores personal loans, but expanding into auto and home equity loans should significantly broaden its addressable market.\n\nDue to a modest profit in Q2, Upstart has earned only $3.1 million this year. Still, revenue of $426 million in the first half of the year is up 59% yearly.\n\nAlso, recent losses temporarily left it without a price-to-earnings ratio. Still, considering its revenue growth, investors are likely to perceive its forward P/E ratio of 39 as reasonable, making it feasible for interested investors to cash in on this potentially lucrative opportunity.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nAnother company banking heavily on AI is social media giant Meta Platforms (META 3.16%). Over 42% of the world's population uses at least one of its social media sites daily.\n\nAmid such saturation, its user base growth slowed to 6%. Thus, to maintain rapid revenue growth over the long term, it leveraged its treasure trove of personal data to help clients train AI models.\n\nIn 2025 alone, it pledged between $66 billion and $72 billion in capital expenditure (capex) to compete in this space, investing heavily in technical improvements and data center capacity to maintain its leadership.\n\nAdditionally, digital advertising continues to drive growth for now. In the first two quarters of 2025, Meta generated $90 billion in revenue, 19% more than the same period last year. In comparison, costs and expenses grew 10% over the same time, allowing its $35 billion in profit for the first half of the year to rise by 36%.\n\nDespite those increases, Meta's stock sells for around 28 times earnings. Considering its rapid growth and growing role in AI, that valuation should make Meta stock attractive to prospective shareholders.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:53.335626+00:00"}

A former managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, Kupor is taking a different path from Elon Musk's tenure under President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. While he credited Musk's Deferred Resignation Program which saw about 154,000 federal employees accept voluntary buyouts Kupor argued that focusing on short-term cuts like dismissing probationary workers does little to address the deeper issues of lagging performance. His aim is to move closer to a system that ties pay to performance and makes it easier to remove underperformers, though he acknowledged this could face significant resistance from unions and congressional Democrats.\n\nIn just five weeks, Kupor has rolled out several changes, including allowing federal workers to promote religious beliefs in the workplace, ordering the removal of Covid-19 vaccination records from personnel files, and ending Musk's weekly five achievements reporting rule. He is weighing additional voluntary resignation windows to trim headcount and sees a bigger challenge in attracting high-caliber talent from the private sector, where compensation packages such as those offered by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to top AI researchers far exceed what the government can match. Kupor suggested that easing degree requirements, offering student debt relief, and creating publicprivate exchange programs where employees can rotate between government and industry could help bridge that gap.\n\nKupor is also exploring a more ambitious idea: allowing pension assets to be invested through a sovereign wealth fund, a strategy used by other nations to seek higher returns than US government bonds typically offer. He noted that such a move would require coordination with the White House, Congress, and agencies like the Treasury Department, and has not yet been formally proposed to the administration. Brought into Washington through connections from Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Kupor said his team is in daily contact with the executive branch. While still early in his tenure, his proposals suggest a focus on structural reform, long-term workforce efficiency, and innovative recruitment strategies that could reshape how the federal government competes for talent.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:03.550807+00:00"}

Microsoft is worth three times more than Tesla.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the ways you might be contributing to Microsoft’s sprawling empire without even knowing it, by using products and services you never knew belonged to the company.\n\nLinkedIn\n\nYou probably know Microsoft is behind the Windows OS that powers your computer. But did you know that you’re expanding Microsoft’s empire every time you use that computer to post resumes, apply for jobs and network on LinkedIn?\n\nIn 2016, Microsoft acquired the world’s largest professional networking site for $26.2 billion, per Microsoft. Today, LinkedIn has more than 1 billion members in more than 200 countries worldwide, according to its website.\n\nSee Next: I Asked AI To Make Me as Much Money as Possible: Here’s What Happened, According To Codie Sanchez\n\nSkype — or, More Recently, Teams\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic minted Zoom as the quarantined world’s videoconferencing platform of choice, there was Skype. Founded in 2003, Skype was a trailblazer in video chat technology. In 2011 Microsoft purchased it for $8.5 billion, absorbing the platform’s more than 160 million active users into the Microsoft ecosystem, according to Microsoft.\n\nDespite the rise of Zoom, Skype remained a juggernaut and you might have spent 14 years using it without realizing you were on a Microsoft app. The platform retained its original brand identity until May 2025, when Microsoft began phasing Skype out and migrating its user base over to Teams. However, many VoIP networks still use Skype infrastructure, whether their users know it or not.\n\nMicrosoft Azure\n\nThe list of Fortune 500 companies that rely on Microsoft Azure for storage, cloud computing, AI, analytics and networking is so vast that it’s unlikely that you haven’t used it without realizing it at some point.\n\nBut it’s not just the private sector. Governments of all sizes across the country use Azure, as do healthcare organizations and pharmaceutical companies. Giants like Campbell’s, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble rely on Azure, as do major banks, retail firms and manufacturers.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:14.291406+00:00"}

I'm grateful to all of you for making this place what it is today.”\n\nThe latest update means that Threads is maintaining its overall growth trajectory, and is inching closer to X on total MAU.\n\nThough I’m not sure how much I believe X’s active user claims.\n\nBecause while Elon Musk says that X now has 600 million monthly active users, the actual data, both reported by X itself and via third party analytics providers, suggests that X is losing audience over time.\n\nIndeed, X’s own EU reporting shows that X has lost 15% of its European user base since Elon took over at the app, while third party analytics suggest that X has seen a significant decline in mobile users, though it still maintains a lead in web traffic. But with web traffic only contributing a minor amount of X’s overall usage (approximately 20%), the trends, based on all data sources other not named Elon, suggest that X is actually down on overall usage, not rising.\n\nWhich would suggest that Threads is actually much closer to becoming the real-time social media platform of choice for the majority, and as more and more people shift over to the app, including influencers and celebrities, that continues to see more engagement happening on Threads, giving Meta another winner in the social media app race.\n\nWhich may not be a good thing. Part of the appeal of Bluesky is that it’s not owned by the big corporations, and is therefore not as beholden to shareholders, billionaire owners, political manipulation, etc. But Bluesky hasn’t caught on as initially hoped.\n\nAfter seeing a surge in sign-ups after last year’s U.S. election, which seemingly pointed to it becoming a more significant consideration, Bluesky’s growth has slowed significantly, and is now sitting on 38 million total users. Bluesky’s still growing, and it has a passionate and engaged user base, but it doesn’t look like it’s going to become a major player in the space.\n\nThough that could still change, with both Musk and Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg continuing to let political influences guide their decisions. That hasn’t worked out well for Musk, and could still become a problem for Meta, and if there is another flood away from the major apps, Bluesky is still ready and waiting for another influx.\n\nRecent history suggests that this will happen, though it does seem like things are stabilizing somewhat, with some of X’s most recent controversies not driving users to Bluesky as they have in the past.\n\nMaybe they’re going to Threads instead, and maybe, that’s contributing to Threads becoming the key rival for X. And if Zuck and Co. don’t suddenly make some radical announcement that turns off its audience, maybe Threads will soon become the leader in the race.\n\nIt seems more likely than not that Threads will take over from X, and become the real-time social leader, and with the Threads team putting a bigger emphasis on relevant, real-time information, it does seem to be getting close to perfecting the recipe for live, in-the-moment engagement.\n\nEither way, it’s become a significant platform, and another weapon in Meta’s ever-growing ad serving system.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:19.322481+00:00"}

Here’s what I’m listening to: PinkPantheress, Lola Young and Evita in London.\n\nPrivileges with the president\n\nDonald Trump announced this week that two US chipmakers would tithe 15% of their revenue from sales in China to the US government. Paying for the license to sell to Chinese customers represents an unprecedented deal.\n\nMy colleague Helen Davidson reports from Taipei:\n\nThe chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the US government 15% of their revenue from advanced chips sold to China in return for export licences to the key market.\n\nThe arrangement will lead to Nvidia giving 15% of its revenue from Chinese sales of its H20 chips, and AMD giving 15% of revenue from Chinese sales of its MI308 chips, according to reports citing US officials.\n\nThe H20 and MI308 chips were banned from sale to China in April, despite the lower-powered H20 being designed specifically to abide by restrictions introduced by the Biden administration.\n\nNvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, head of the most valuable company in the world at $4.44tn, has been lobbying the White House for months to open up sales in China, where the US still prohibits sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips over national security concerns. In July, Trump relaxed some restrictions imposed by Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nThe deal with Nvidia and AMD seems as much about personally appealing to Trump as it does about generating revenue for the US government. The agreement has all the trappings of Trump entering into business with the chipmakers.\n\nIn a way, it’s a version of a playbook other major tech companies have been trying out as Trump is dramatically changing the international business landscape. Apple announced a $100bn investment commitment in US manufacturing. CEO Tim Cook, who had made the journey to the White House himself, presented Trump with a glass trophy (including 24 karat gold base) designating the president a graduate of the Apple Manufacturing Academy, launched in Michigan the week prior.\n\nDuring his meeting with Cook, Trump said he would levy a 100% tariff on semiconductor chips, which could set both Apple and Nvidia back billions. However, the president said: “If you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.”\n\nBoth Nvidia and Apple are likely to be exempted from the tariffs. Each appears to have paid for the privilege – Apple with its domestic investment, Nvidia with its revenue-sharing agreement.\n\nOpenAI debuts GPT-5\n\nOpenAI launched the new version of the artificial intelligence that underpins ChatGPT last week.

It's also one of the hottest large-cap tech stocks on the market. Only two members of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have delivered greater gains than Microsoft this year.\n\nMeta Platforms (META 3.16%) is one of them. Outside of gaming, Meta's and Microsoft's paths have rarely intersected in the past. However, Meta's newest artificial intelligence (AI) initiative could change that. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent explanation of his company's strategy could even be interpreted as a warning shot fired across Microsoft's bow.\n\nMeta's dream\n\nLess than two weeks ago, Zuckerberg described Meta's dream for superintelligence in a public statement. He said that Meta wants \"to bring personal superintelligence to everyone.\"\n\nWhat is superintelligence? It's similar to artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is defined differently by some but usually refers to AI that can learn and perform tasks at least as well as humans. Superintelligence goes further than AGI, though, with capabilities that far exceed humans.\n\nZuckerberg envisioned a future where every person has a \"personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.\" That sounds better than the dark predictions that AGI and superintelligence could eliminate many jobs and leave humans with little to do.\n\nIs Meta's dream pie in the sky? Maybe not. The company seems to be making tangible progress toward developing superintelligence. Zuckerberg said:\n\nOver the last few months we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves. The improvement is slow for now, but undeniable. Developing superintelligence is now in sight.\n\nMicrosoft investors' worst nightmare\n\nMeta's superintelligence vision might not seem to affect Microsoft at first blush. However, note something else Zuckerberg said: \"If trends continue, then you'd expect people to spend less time in productivity software, and more time creating and connecting.\"\n\nMicrosoft is practically synonymous with productivity software. Its apps, including Excel, Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Teams, all of which are now bundled into Microsoft 365, are used by millions of people across the world.\n\nIn the quarter ending June 30, 2025, Microsoft's productivity and business processes segment generated revenue of $33.1 billion. The segment is Microsoft's biggest moneymaker, contributing 43% of its total revenue.\n\nGranted, some of Microsoft's productivity and business processes segment revenue stems from LinkedIn. The professional networking social media platform doesn't fall into the category of productivity software. While Microsoft didn't release a specific revenue figure for LinkedIn, external estimates of the platform's revenue indicate that it likely accounts for less than 15% of the productivity and business processes segment's revenue.\n\nThe bottom line is that any major slashing of productivity-software revenue and profits would arguably be Microsoft investors' worst nightmare. And Zuckerberg has predicted that Meta's superintelligence initiative will lead to a significant drop in the time people spend using productivity software.\n\nCould Microsoft be in trouble?\n\nWhether or not Microsoft's business could be jeopardized by Meta's superintelligence efforts depends, in large part, on how successful those efforts are. Skepticism on this front could be warranted. Technology executives have made predictions in the past that didn't come true.\n\nHowever, I think there's another more important reason why Meta's superintelligence vision might not threaten Microsoft all that much. Note that Zuckerberg said that people would probably spend less time using productivity software; he didn't say that productivity software would be used less.\n\nThat's a critical distinction, because AI may continue to use productivity software. Microsoft itself is investing heavily in enabling AI to do many of the tasks that people have done in the past with its productivity software.\n\nIs Meta's superintelligence dream Microsoft investors' worst nightmare? I don't think so. Instead, I expect both Meta and Microsoft to enable long-term investors to sleep peacefully for a long time to come.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:26.020892+00:00"}

That recent rally has left many tech stocks either fully valued or overvalued.\n\nBut just because it's harder to find a bargain doesn't mean there aren't good values in the tech sector. As it stands today in early August, these three names still look like good opportunities to scoop up for the long run.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (META 3.16%) stock has appreciated almost nine times over since its 2022 lows, which is incredible to think about. Therefore, some may believe the stock is now overvalued.\n\nBut in terms of valuation today, Meta is still not expensive. Shares currently trade at 27.6 times earnings, which is a little bit above the market. Still, those earnings incorporate two big investments that are forward-looking and not really benefiting current revenue: Reality Labs, and Meta's massive new artificial \"superintelligence\" venture.\n\nIn the first half of the year, the Reality Labs segment lost a whopping $8.7 billion, while the \"core\" advertising business saw $46.7 billion in operating income. Moreover, that core operating income may be impacted by increased depreciation costs of Meta's recent AI-related capital spending.\n\nYet just stripping out Reality Labs losses, Meta appears to on track to make over $100 billion in operating profit this year through its \"core\" Facebook and Instagram platforms. In that light, its current $1.9 trillion market cap doesn't look that demanding in relation to the core ads business, which grew an impressive 21.4% last quarter.\n\nIf, for some reason, the metaverse and artificial superintelligence bets don't work out, CEO Mark Zuckerberg could just cancel those investments and concentrate on Meta's core platforms, which have some of the strongest network effects of any business today.\n\nIn that scenario, Meta should still do well. However, if Zuckerberg's massive bets lead to AI superintelligence before its peers get there, there's significant upside. Since Meta is one of just a few companies that could crack superintelligence first, it's a must-own stock, given its reasonable price today.\n\nApplied Materials\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing equipment vendor Applied Materials (AMAT 2.16%) still finds its stock almost 30% below last summer's all-time highs, while trading at a quite reasonable 19 times 2025 earnings estimates and 18 times 2026 earnings estimates.\n\nThere is perhaps some concern over the the near-term growth outlook, especially after rival ASML Holdings said last month that it couldn't guarantee a growth year in 2026. U.S.-China tensions may also be playing a part, as sales to Chinese customers made up 25% of Applied's revenues last quarter.\n\nHowever, Applied may be in a better position than ASML for the near and medium-term. This is because chipmakers are currently migrating to a new type of transistor architecture, going from finFET transistors, with the gate on three sides of the transistor source, to gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, in which transistors are stacked vertically with the gate on all four sides.\n\nThis new innovation is less about lithography, which is where ASML dominates, and more about etch and deposition, which is where Applied generates most of its business. Furthermore, there is likely the need for a combination of innovative packaging and metrology technologies to pull the new transistor architecture off. As the most diversified semicap equipment company, Applied is in prime position to offer combined solutions to help customers solve these complex problems.\n\nWith its stock down significantly from its highs, Applied has a dividend yield that stands at 1%. However, the company has raised its dividend at high rates over the last three years, with a 19% increase in 2023, a 25% increase in 2024, and a 15% increase in 2025. And the company's payout ratio is still below 20% of earnings, leaving even more firepower to raise the dividend and repurchase shares in the future.\n\nOn Semiconductor\n\nPower, analog, and sensor chip producer On Semiconductor (ON 6.18%) fell hard after its recent earnings, but the drop may be an excellent opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nAt first glance, it's hard to understand why On fell after earnings. The company beat revenue expectations and met adjusted earnings expectations, while Q3 guidance was basically in-line. But On had experienced a strong rally off the April bottom, so perhaps investors were expecting more in the way of a recovery in its core auto and industrial chip business.\n\nOn's end-markets have been in one- to three-year downturns, depending on the market, as the post-COVID buying spree in cars and industrial chips gave way to a painful hangover. Yet while the recovery may not have been as strong as hoped, On's normally conservative management seems assured the bottom is in. CEO Hassane El-Khoury said in the press release, \"We are beginning to see signs of stabilization across our end markets, and we remain well positioned to benefit from a market recovery.\"\n\nOn is a leader in silicon carbide chips, which are increasingly needed in electric vehicles (EVs), energy infrastructure, and even AI data centers, although that data center revenue is small right now. While the core EV market has been slowing in the U.S. and Europe, if EVs are in fact the future, On should do well over the long-term. Meanwhile, El-Khoury noted On's AI data center revenue nearly doubled last quarter relative to the prior year. So, when On's auto and industrial end markets fully recover, this new high-growth data center business could be a cherry on top.\n\nMeanwhile, On has still been producing cash flow even during this downturn, enabling it to repurchase stock at low prices as investors wait for a recovery. Thus, the post-earnings give-back looks like a good opportunity to add to this long-term winner, which seems set for an inevitable recovery over the next couple of years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:27.371049+00:00"}

There are also hidden collectibles and in-game wearables.\n\nThere’s an IRL tie-in, with McDonald’s also launching a themed meal that comes with a souvenir kit.\n\nAs reported by Upload VR, McDonalds developed its new VR experience with media agency Admerasia, building a fully immersive VR environment, which can also be experienced on the web (though not in VR, of course).\n\nAnd if Meta’s metaverse vision ever comes to reality, it could well be the future of digital interaction, giving people an opportunity to engage in custom, themed VR environments, that are linked to real world purchases.\n\nThough the current state of it does remind me a little of this:\n\nRemember this image, which Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared to much derision back in 2022. The basic textures and graphics of McDonaldland look much the same, which doesn’t really capture the opportunity of VR, and how advanced Meta’s VR experiences are becoming over time.\n\nI mean, the fact that a brand can even create an immersive VR world is a massive step, while the basic graphics, when you consider that they need to be rendered in fully immersive environments, make sense. And they’re no worse than the presentation of Roblox, which has millions of young users, so when you factor all of the elements in, it is a significant undertaking, which could resonate with the target audience.\n\nBut it’s not blowing anybody away, and while it may well be a technical achievement, I don’t think it’s going to get a heap more people buying a Quest headset.\n\nBut it’s still early days for VR, and for Meta’s metaverse vision, which is still a thing, despite Zuck and Co. shifting their focus to AI of late.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Meta is also developing advanced VR creation tools, which will eventually enable anybody to build their own custom VR environment, by simply speaking it into existence and letting Meta’s AI tools create the back-end code to support the concept.\n\nAnd as Meta’s VR rendering gets better, that could lead to some truly breathtaking experiences.\n\nBut it’s still early, and brands are still exploring what’s possible, in VR, the metaverse, gaming worlds, etc.\n\nSo while it may not seem hugely impressive now, McDonald’s is working to keep up with the next shifts, and to build tools that will enable it to remain present wherever attention shifts.\n\nAnd if McDonald’s is investing in VR, that’s probably a sign that this is a serious opportunity, which will be coming in the near future.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:33.872533+00:00"}

I'm like, well, like, I understand what you're trying to say, but if you're vulnerable cybersecurity wise, you can't see, they deny GPS. You can't do anything.\n\n0:28 spk_1\n\nWelcome to War Money, the show devoted to supporting our brother sister veterans. I'm Patrick Murphy\n\n0:32 spk_0\n\nand I'm Dan Coons.\n\n0:33 spk_1\n\nToday we're tackling a game changing topic how the tech industry and the military recruit veterans in the high demand roles from AI to robotics to cybersecurity and data partnerships, these public private partnerships between the government, the private sector, and our military, and really some top sector private sector companies.We'll break down where the real opportunities are and give you the tactical advice on how to position yourself for the next wave of tech careers. Let's jump in.All right, Dan, we got to jump in. we gotta make sure when we have about 200,000 veterans who leave military or military that leave service every day with a security clearance, most of them, how they can easily go into AI data, cybersecurity. Why is that important, uh, to have these polar partners and for these veterans to know what opportunities are out there?\n\n1:27 spk_0\n\nAll right, so you know, my last 4 years in the Army reserves was helping build the 75th Innovation Command, right? So the 75th Innovation Army 5th Innovation Command, the job, the intent of that was to capture, uh, active duty soldiers or reservists that had very unique skills to bring back to the contribute to the Department of Defense, the military, right? The umThe blend of retirement, and I'm going to connect a couple concepts, right? There was this original way there was a linear career we had to spend 20 years waiting for your retirement to kick in, your pension to kick in. We are, we're all accustomed to that. Several years ago, and I think you right around when you were in there, they advented the the blended retirement. So the blended retirement kind of works a little bit more closely to a traditional 401k. There's some pensionary benefits and there's some disability benefits as well, and we can talk more about that in different episodes, right?But what that's really incentivized, I think, is a lot of what it's done in the civilian sector, which isHey, like, you can serve for 4 years, and then you can go to the reserve and spend another 16 years, and you can pop in and out of active duty as it makes sense for you, or you can just leave, you can go do your thing, you can be on IRR inactive ready reserves for quite a while, and then you can come back and contribute as you have to.The whole purpose, I think of like the transitioning veterans that we have the $200,000 a year, just keep your uniform on in some capacity, right? I'm still on the IRR. I, I just keep your uniform on, use, I don't know if I'm going to go back into the service at all, but if somebody calls me, it's way easier for me to come.IRR than it is for me to like recapture my commission. So I think it's a good thing for our national security. It's a good thing for our country to have the ability to have some of these 200,000 people that are coming off of reserves and active duty to have an outlet to come back and serve again. On the other side of it, I'm sorry, the other side of it, you have trained.Very well organized, very good people that are trained at some of the best places in the world ready to enter your workforce. Like, if you are one of those 12 critical infrastructure areas, why would you not hire a cybersecurity professional from your state to contribute to your mission at home? Like, I don't, that doesn't make sense to me. Like why wouldn't you do that?\n\n3:36 spk_1\n\nAnd, and that people don't understand is because we, when we have of a million American soldiers, right, just the army.Specifically, and you know, I remember we had the, you know, my job was to make sure we recruited enough 120,000, 60,000, 60,000 in active duty, 60,000 in the reserve component. The majority of our soldiers are in the reserve component, are in the reserve, are in the National Guard.\n\n3:55 spk_0\n\n70%of 70% of soldiers are ins, which is the backbone of the entire thing, right? Navy's army keeps rolling along. 70% of the military's logistics, right? That is what, and then 70% of that comes from the reserves. Like it is not.Necessarily an organic organization, like there's things you have to train on all the time, and there's things that you don't have to train on all the time. You have to have global logistics, but you don't have to do it every day. Like you've gotta, you gotta do war fighting things every day. You don't have to do everything else all the time, right?\n\n4:24 spk_1\n\nAnd that's whyI think, you know, when we tell people like for veterans out there for active military or whether, you know, transitioning, whether the veterans are just transitioning to a new job, you know, find your purpose, you know, what are your values, you know, live a value driven, a purpose driven life and part of that isYou know, be confident, you know, when you serve in the army, it's a Fortune 2 size\n\n4:42 spk_0\n\nnavy or, or, and then the space force and the Air Force with all that's going on, not, not on land right now. Like we, we in the space industry, which is where I existed, we do not have enough, we do not have enough professionals and artificial intelligence, we don't have enough professionals either, right? We, we don't have enough people. So back to the like the the next comment, like, why wouldn't the United States Army and NavyThe Air Force or Space Force want to recruit the best and brightest from industry to come in and help them with these new, these new technologies. Like that, that is what we need to do to win,\n\n5:15 spk_1\n\nright? And that's why, which is great is that's why you're seeing, making it easier and if you're a veteran or if you're an active service and you're saying, well, I'm not a cyber warrior, you don't have to be. They train you up on it and you need to\n\n5:26 spk_0\n\ntrans and and you need to, but you need to translate like you need to translate to some infantry guy somewhere why they should care about cyber.I think they're finally understanding it now, but like, it took a really long time for somebody to understand why do I need a cyber professional in my unit if we're going to go do knock down doors. I'm like, well, like I understand what you're trying to say, but if you're vulnerable cybersecurity wise, you can't see, they deny GPS. You can't do anything.\n\n5:51 spk_1\n\nAll right, we got to talk, you know, the great thing about where money is we get the best and the brightest on our shows when you have folks. We had a great American, Jay Long. Jay Long on our first.Airborne, West Point graduate, uh, the CEO of Parlay Finance, his wife is the CEO, just, just a phenomenal human being, but he is now the commander of Detachment 201. Tell me what detachment 201 is because I am pumped aboutthis.\n\n6:14 spk_0\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. So, so I, I remember I told you the 5th Innovation commander, there's a core group of people, Jim Perkins, Chris, I have to use their ranks probably. No, I'm not gonna use the ranks. They're my friends. Jim Perkins, Chris Salley, Craig Robbins, Jay Long.Dan Koons and a few other people created this like nucleus of ideas where we just want to get talent in the organization, right? So they created this tool called Gig Eagle. Gig Eagle was a collaboration with DIU. We brought in this concept of like, hey, jobs in the military are gig jobs. We need the best and brightest to fill hard roles, and we fill those hard roles with really, really smart people, right?So this whole detachment to one thing happened, it was announced recently, but it's been years in the making, right? What what Colonel Saling had to use, but Chris had to figure out was like the authorities existed for us to bring these people into a service anyway. We've had as long as the military has existed, we've had revit promotions. We've had like, we've had the ability to promote people and bring people in based on the demands and needs of the organization, right? Technology is the new one. So we brought in 4 executives from 4 of the major organizations like OpenAI.I met a, where else? Paltier, yeah, yeah. And so like, and\n\n7:24 spk_1\n\nby the way,Dan, it's not just, it's not just like backbenchers. These are folks in these organizations. And I\n\n7:29 spk_0\n\nand I firmly believe that like there's, there's two different modes of operation, right? Like I worked for a company that used to talk about bimodal, bimodal innovation, right? You had your slow, steady mo you had your slow, steady innovation, and then you had your fast rapid innovation, right? And the only way for organizations like these organizations to exist is by doing both. You can't.You, you can't operate as you always did and expect to be in business, especially how fast these things are changing. That is, that is the army rolling along right here, right? But for us to leapfrog, to actually go from here to there, we need to bring in people that understand how to capture and harness the best of chat GPT. We need to do VR virtual reality better, augmented reality better. We need to be able to do all those things. And why would I not want somebody that understands that? Like, and I hear in the background like.I don't need the DOD to get better at buying palant here. I don't know, like, I feel really uncomfortable about that. Like, I hear that concern. I understand it. But the reality is, I'd really rather harness that the right way.And put the right acquisition rules and right conflict of interest rules in place, then preclude great talent from being there because we're afraid they're going to break a couple of acquisition rules. Like there's a way to have both, and we have to have enough integrity to be able to make that work.\n\n8:40 spk_1\n\nAnd listen, when you take that oath to support and defend the Constitution, you are a leader character for lifetime of service. So it's like when you say don't necessarily hang your uniform up forever, you know, be ready. Like, listen, I, I, you never know if Fuck with Sam's gonna call you. I have to do 82 pushups if I want to go back to the division.Uh, and I could do it, right, but part of that is, is having, you know, the best and the brightest. Our duty to our young war fighters, the sons and daughters of our best is to, and make sure they don't have a fair fight, that they have the technical tactical advantage of enemies that are trying to do our families harm, so.\n\n9:10 spk_0\n\nWell, I mean, there's also this concept like an officer candidate school as an officer candidate does not lie, cheat, or steal or tolerate those that do, right? That's like the, that's the essence of what I like and that's my personal essence. Like, if you're going to lie to your shield, I'm not going to tolerate or I'm not going to do it and I'm not gonna tolerate others that do it, right?And so if we're worried about people skipping and lying because they're gonna give like disproportionate like, we got to get back to an integrity-based culture where like you are here because it's the best thing for you to do and it's the best thing for the country. I think most of why we like our veteran network so much is like, I believe that ethos exists primarily and when it doesn't, we kind of know who those people are and they like Blue Falcon themselves out of the organization. We know, we, we know you can smell it.And those people don't exist for very long because it's like it's a high integrity organization.\n\n9:56 spk_1\n\nYeah, yeah, self-select.\n\n9:58 spk_0\n\nI'm cool with that. Yeah,\n\n9:59 spk_1\n\nyeah, yeah, yeah, get out of here. And I, and I do think that especially when you look at, you want to show people if they see it they could be it. I want the people to know that this, these sweet sweet C-suite executives from open.AI from Palantir from Meta that are going to detachment to a1. Yeah, they're, they're put on the rank of lieutenant colonel and that's, you know, that's an, that's an '05. That's a big deal, right? But they spent decades getting to that level. They're not, they're not there, yeah, and, and we need them in within our ranks, uh, and to get them in there and, and I do think that, yes, anything we have a change organization, especially organization as big as the army, there's gonna be some people who are, you know, get adjuda, butWe can't forget why we're here and we're here to protect the American families. We're here to have the technical advantage of our enemies, and we're here, as you said, is the\n\n10:47 spk_0\n\nManhattan Project, right? We like Guggenheim, we brought in the best and brightest minds to create the atomic bomb, right, the nuclear bomb, right?That that is, I don't think that this AI revolution is very far away from what that was. Like this, this revolution that we're going through right now is going to change the world similar to what the advent of that power source did as well for us. So like we have to do it the right way.\n\n11:09 spk_1\n\nAnd when we come back from break, we're gonna let veterans know what they could do to empower themselves, whether they're an active service or now a veteran or anyone else transitioning, how you can get these skills, how people will invest in you, and how you can do what's necessary.They get a leg up on the jobs of the future. Back in just a minute.All right, welcome back. Let's discuss the practical moves, programs, and resources to help you transition into these high demand tech career, careers and secure your financial future. So this you and I, we, we.Advise folks on how to be stoics, how to invest, how you can do $100 a month, and how the beauty of the eighth wonder of the world can compound compound interest and how it'll help you. You know, these are things that, you know, I think neither one of our parents taught us and we're, we're not, you know, it's not a, you know, we're not putting them down. It's just that, you know, they didn't understand it, they didn't know it. But when I look atYou know, we're both hockey players. Wayne Gretzky said, you know, he said, how did you score so many goals? How many, how many assists, all these assists that he had and they're like, cause I don't pass the puck where people are. I passed the puck where people are gonna be.These jobs are the future. They're not going to be taken away from AI. They need leaders of character. They need people who are problem solvers, that are leaders, that will show up on time, that are good teammates. What do you see in some of those programs out there, whether it's task force movement or others that are helping people get those certifications necessary to get the qualifications, get get these jobs in the future.\n\n12:36 spk_0\n\nI have areally strong opinion about.The linearity of education, right? Let's, let's like, let's be like kind of nerdy about this for one second, right? You don't stop learning when you're 22 years old. Like you don't, like somebody doesn't come out of college and be like, you know everything that you're ever going to learn, or you don't finish high school at 18 and like go to a trade school like my dad did. He was a, he went to electrical straight school. He was an apprentice for a few years and we could be journey man, right? And then he went on to create his career that way, right?We, we, we live in an economy, we live in a world where if you are not learning something new, you are going to be falling behind. It's just, it's the reality of the situation, right? There's, there's not a lot of static jobs that you can get into right now, that's gonna be the exact same way that it was 50 years ago. So like,You can, uh, last week I was in uh Albany, New York at a semiconductor facility, and I met the director of that facility, right? He'd been there for 25 years and he told me that his job changes every week. So he's had to learn a new skill set or a new capability every week, which leads me back to the answer to that question.The VA and the education benefits, the ones that you fought so hard to get our veterans, right? And the ones that you get because you're in service exist there to help you from a lifelong lifelong education perspective. I don't care if you go to a laborer. I don't care if you're a welder. I don't care if you engage with Task Force movement the transition into trucking or cyber or healthcare. That doesn't matter to me. What matters to me is that you're continuing to upskill yourself to create more value for yourself so that over time you're making more money.That makes this whole 8th wonder of the world compound interest easier is if you actually have some money to compound, right? If you have no money, if you're broke, you can't compound broke. Like it just doesn't, I guess, I guess you can, but it doesn't go anywhere. It's time 0 doesn't do anything, right? So you at least need times 1 or 10, right? That's what you have to do. And the only way to get there is by increasing your skill set. And I don't care if it's you turn a wrench better or you weld better or you read better or you learn better. Like you've got to do that path,\n\n14:30 spk_1\n\nright? And I, we talk.Entrepreneurs all the time or want to be entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs. Hey, don't quit your day job. You to the side, build it up and, you know, get in the right day job that that you're passionate about, right? But that's why I think, and it's hard for our fellow brothers to veterans to understand like the economy is changing. They want skills-based. They don't necessarily work care where your college degree is in. What could you do for them? How are you gonna solve problems for them? How are you gonna, you know, build their business?\n\n14:56 spk_0\n\nI mean, higher eds in trouble, higher ed's in a little bit of trouble, right? Right, like.That that whole model of like, let's just like, like stack credentials on top of each other for a fixed cost, like that's that's that model's not that that model is probably not gonna work very long, like,I go back to school probably every 2 years and I get a certificate, right? I got one at MIT on business implications of artificial intelligence. I went to Wharton for venture capital, private equity. The next one I'll probably do is on like innovation or strategy at Stanford. Like, I'm gonna go do something in the next couple of years that puts me in a position to learn some skill set that I don't know, like, or I'll go to board level. I'll go to something where I learned something else, right?This whole notion that you're done at 22 or done at 25 when you're going to grad school, it just doesn't, it doesn't work for the way that the world's going, like Chad GPT came out 2.5 years ago.The world has changed since I came on board. Like, it is not the same. It is you, you've got to adjust or you will, or you will have problems,\n\n15:51 spk_1\n\nright? And that's why I like when I and because I use it and I get all these things because they must hear me, all these ads for Coursera and all this. I'm like, hey, and I, I think the other courses. How did I\n\n15:59 spk_0\n\nlearn this? How do I learn this thing? Let's do Coursera? I learn\n\n16:01 spk_1\n\nItalian,\n\n16:02 spk_0\n\nright?\n\n16:03 spk_1\n\nBut I would say like that's why for our brothers to veterans, they should know you could use your VA, your VA home loan to to buy another property. You could use.Use the the post I GI bill to get so many certification courses, right? But, but again, they just have to be credited. There's ways around it. But invest in yourself and understand that you can do these jobs. It's not rocket science. You just got to put the work in. Yeah,\n\n16:27 spk_0\n\nI'm just going to change some of the language too, right? There's no such thing as a tech job. It is a it is a job. Like there is no such thing as a tech job or a non-tech job. Every job has some level of technology in it, right? Like.I had somebody come to my house a couple weeks ago to repair my microwave. They, they spent like 1 2nd on my microwave and 20 minutes on the tools that were they were trying to figure out what was wrong with my microwave. Like this is we're not living in a world where some guy comes in your house, dismantles your microwave, uses their 20 years of knowledge and figures.it out like they're, they're plugging that into a diagnostic tool machine. They're figuring out what's wrong with that. That's a tech job. That's, that's what that is, right? And if you don't know how to work with the technology, and if you see it as like not capable of being used, then you're gonna be in a really, really, really bad space. So like that's what I'm trying to say, like you can translate your military experience and I know, I don't know a military role that doesn't involve technology. I've never been one. I've never been in one.So that just means that every job is a technology job. Every technology job is a job, and you've got to be able to enable it yourself from there. Yeah,\n\n17:30 spk_1\n\nand soI would say that the the veterans out there, uh, or folks who are going to be veterans soon, you know, check out things like vets and tech, check out things like Task Force movement. Uh, I was the chair of that initiative, you were the vice chair, you know, we, we gave literally millions of dollars for certification, so you don't have to get, so you get your what's called CDL, your commercial driver's license. You have to spend $10,000 your own money, you could use, you know, get these scholarships.We have, we gave millions of dollars on scholarships for cybersecurity certifications, not degrees, certifications,\n\n17:59 spk_0\n\nand one of the best places to get certifications at. I know we both, this is both near heart, community colleges. Like we both want the like don't look at your Ivy League schools as your only opportunity to upskill yourself. Like I went to Montgomery County Community College. You went to Bucks County Community College all Southeast Pennsylvania.They have some of the most well rooted like or organized for employers in your area. And if wherever you live, if you live in um Tidewater, Virginia or you live in Arizona, you've got a community college somewhere and they know they should know if they're good at it, they should know what the local employers want. They, they should know that you need CAD designer, whatever the hell you need.But they should know what it is.\n\n18:39 spk_1\n\nYeah. And then you're seeing some of the, you know, I know we think higher ed's in trouble, and no doubt it is. There's about 400,000 less grads\n\n18:45 spk_0\n\nare the major ones like the hierarchical ones are.\n\n18:49 spk_1\n\nWell, I would say that I think the main brand ones are gonna be always fine. It's the ones that are the mid-market, the lower market. But I think when you have leaders like, you know, we're big fans of Rowan University, what Rowan's doing.You know, they just opened up a veterinary school. They've a med school. They're really doubling down on hiring veterans or getting veterans to go to their schools and saying, hey, if you don't get in, we already have a partnership with the community college. You can matriculate there and us at the same time, you won't live on campus, but then in year 2, year 3, you could live on campus. And because they're trying to make, you know, South Jersey to Silicon Valley, the East Coast.\n\n19:20 spk_0\n\nYeah, and they're, they're doing the first thing that's most important and the president of school is doing an amazing job. They're making this stuff accessible, right.Like all technology does, right? It, it broke my heart when I had to go to a virtual class and pay full freight to go do it. Why are you making me pay for all the heating, the energy, the electricity of that whole building if I'm just gonna go on Zoom to learn something, right? Like, I'm cool with it, but you should discount me, right? Accessibility to education, there should be no barrier now with technology. We all have phones, we all have zooms, we all have the ability of Coursera or whatever is on YouTube. Like, you should have the access to education right there. So I think to distill this down like.You are not too late or not too dumb to learn anything that you need to go learn, right? And just because you were an E4 and just because you came in as bad that wasn't amazing, doesn't mean that you're not smart enough to learn what has, what has to be learned. Like, just cause you didn't score 110 or what like it doesn't matter. You've got to learn something and then you gotta have the confidence to be able to work your way through it. Yeah.\n\n20:19 spk_1\n\nAnd I think that's a great thing about our show where Money, we're just letting people know like there's things that are there are out there, like what we we started.Tess movement. But there's the Warriors scholar program. Warriors scholar program is, if you are going to go to a college and, you know, and you haven't been in school in a minute because you're in the military, you know, and they double down on some of the Ivy League stuff, but they give you a course so before you even start on day one, you're, you're, you're getting used to it. You're getting reps. Other organizations like, you know, American Corporate Partners, right, where you're allowing folks to go do internships, uh, when they're leaving, uh, we're big fans of Skillbridge, where you can go work.In corporate America for almost up to 6 months on the government's dime to go, to go and work at a company and it's like a tryout. It's free for the company. It's free, you know, for the troops because they're still on their Uncle Sam's payroll. Um, these are ways to make sure that transition is smooth. And why is that important for veterans? Why should they care? Because in the transition piece, that's where people fall through the cracks\n\n21:14 spk_0\n\n100%\n\n21:15 spk_1\n\nand we have that value, that ethic that we leave no one behind.\n\n21:18 spk_0\n\nYeah, I totally agree. And it's also, let me just kind of summarize a little bit of what we talked about, right?Um, we need to figure out ways to keep both keep people in uniform and contribute to the mission.And we need for ways for corporate America and businesses to figure out how to utilize.Military veteran and frankly blue collar workers, right? Never mind if you're military or not, just if you're blue collar labor based workers, right? And the way we do that, I think, is by bridging the gap between the translation gap between what are your skills here and what are your skills there and how do we marry those two skills up. And if you don't have the skills for your employer, then you, we have to train you to get there. And if you don't have the skills for the military, we got to partner you with the right people to bring you in, right? And this unit 201 detachment.I know there's gonna be some consternation. I, I, I feel it in my bones that there's gonna be legacy people saying like, hey, not legacy people, really good Americans are gonna say, hey, it feels like you're skipping the line to become a lieutenant colonel. Hey, you're not, you're not contributing the force the same way that I did. I understand. I totally understand. The reality is we needAll of the above in our forces, right? We need the meta guy. We need the open AI guy. We need, we need these gal. We need these people to come and contribute on both sides because we just, the, the scale of the threat is too big and the problem is too big.\n\n22:34 spk_1\n\nYep. And I hope the veterans out there in the military spouses, which by the way, have a 24% unemployment rate.Military spouses.\n\n22:40 spk_0\n\nLizO'Brien was on the show talking about it like,\n\n22:42 spk_1\n\nyeah, we need vets in tech. We need vets in tech and there's pathways to get you there. Reach out to us, we'll we'll square you away. And why is that? Look at the openings. 3.4 million open jobs and cybersecurity.People are dying for more folks in the AI. People are dying for folks\n\n23:02 spk_0\n\nand saw Mark Zuckerberg's cold emailing people trying to get him on the AI jobs for like and giving him millions of dollars to get it like that's, that's the opportunity that we're moving into. But AI is just the tip of the ice.Right? All the stuff underneath of it. We don't have enough energy, people that know energy systems to support artificial intelligence, data center operators, data center coolers. There's all this work that has to go into it, and you can't tell me you can build a tank one day and not a data center the other day. I won't believe it.\n\n23:31 spk_1\n\nYeah, so all right, so.Uh, shout out to Jay Long. We started attachment 201. Vets in Tech.

These are two of the largest, most closely watched names in the market, and right now they both appear to be on the verge of significant technical breakouts.\n\nOver the past few months, their paths have diverged. Tesla has been grinding through a year marked by choppy, and volatile price action, while Meta has marched steadily higher, leading the broad market. Despite these differences, both are now aligned in that they both have strong bullish catalysts, and their charts are flashing high-probability breakout signals.\n\nBelow, I’ll break down what’s driving each stock, highlight the most relevant quantitative metrics, and walk you through the technical setups that could set the stage for the next big move.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla Stock on the Verge of a Comeback\n\nTesla has spent much of the past year navigating a storm of mixed investor sentiment, partly tied to shifting perceptions of its core EV business, partly to Elon Musk’s sometimes polarizing public presence, and partly to uncertainty over whether the company’s future lies more in cars or in ambitious side bets like humanoid robots. The result has been choppy, often volatile price action, with the stock barely gaining over the past twelve months even as the broader market has marched higher.\n\nThat said, Tesla is no stranger to long consolidation phases followed by explosive bull runs. Historically, the stock’s biggest rallies have come after extended periods of sideways action, and the current setup is starting to look like one of those moments. On Monday morning, shares broke decisively above a three-month consolidation range, a move that, if sustained, could mark the start of a significant bull run.\n\nFundamentally, two potential game-changers are on the horizon: the rollout of Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot and the much-anticipated self-driving taxi business. Either could open entirely new revenue streams and spark renewed enthusiasm from investors, especially if early deployments impress.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Tesla still carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating, reflecting near-term earnings estimate trends. However, technical action suggests the market’s tone toward the stock may be shifting. As long as shares hold above the breakout level around $338, the path of least resistance appears higher, with momentum traders likely to pile in.\n\nTradingView\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nShares of Meta Approach Another Record High\n\nMeta Platforms has enjoyed a remarkably smooth ride over the past year, steadily attracting buyers as both sales and profits continue to grow at an impressive pace. The company’s aggressive push into artificial intelligence, integrating AI across its ad platform and more recently ramping up hiring for its in-house AI lab, has reinforced investor confidence in its ability to stay ahead of the curve in digital advertising and beyond.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:39.184422+00:00"}

(NASDAQ:META) just handed them one. This week, Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. secured a $29 billion financing package for Meta's new AI-focused data center in Louisiana, a rare move into the investment-grade debt arena typically owned by Wall Street banks. Pimco is arranging $26 billion in debt, Blue Owl is committing $3 billion in equity, and Morgan Stanley is advising on the structure, which is expected to be backed by the data center's assets. It's the largest single-project AI data center financing to date, potentially setting a new precedent for private credit's role in big-ticket infrastructure.\n\nThe timing reflects an accelerating AI build-out across the U.S. Elon Musk's xAI Corp. has told investors it aims to spend $18 billion on data centers, while Amazon.com Inc. and OpenAI Inc. are pursuing their own large-scale sites. Morgan Stanley estimates capital expenditures tied to AI could surpass $3 trillion in the next three years. Securing Meta's deal was highly competitive Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co. reached the final round, with Brookfield Asset Management Ltd., Blackstone Inc., and Ares Management Corp. also vying for the mandate. By scale, Meta's project stands well above other recent AI infrastructure financings, most of which have been under $10 billion.\n\nFor private credit, this could be the start of a deeper move into investment-grade opportunities, a market Apollo sees as potentially reaching $40 trillion. With corporate M&A slowing, the sector is looking to deploy an estimated $450 billion in available capital into new asset classes. Blue Owl CEO Marc Lipschultz has compared the AI push to a modern Gold Rush only here, the picks and shovels are the funding structures behind the data centers.

This is a 12% drop compared with the $25.05bn reported a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.40 compared with expectations of $0.42, while operating income of $923m was also lower than the expected $1.23bn.\n\nShares in Tesla ( TSLA ) fell in after hours trading following the release of its second-quarter earnings , as electric vehicle (EV) company slightly missed Wall Street estimates.\n\nWith that in mind, here's more detail on how the Mag 7 companies are performing so far.\n\nHowever, the latest deadline expired on 7 August , after which Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs came into effect. Further announcements around duties since then and continued uncertainty over Trump's future tariff plans loom over markets, as the second half of the year gets underway.\n\nThis was followed by pauses on the US implementing higher tariffs on certain trading partners, extending the deadline by which they had to negotiate trade deals, which offered some relief to investors.\n\nUS president Donald Trump's unveiling of sweeping tariffs on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\" on 2 April also rocked the Mag 7, as well as markets more broadly.\n\nThese questions were front of mind when going into the first earnings season of the year, in addition to increasingly high expectations from investors as to what to expect from the performance of these companies.\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cheaper AI model in January raised questions over the level of spending on the technology by the major US companies and rattled investors.\n\nThe latest earnings season has been another test for the group, some of which had recovered more recently following a turbulent start to 2025.\n\nMany of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants have now reported their latest quarterly earnings, with the results receiving a mixed response from investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Tesla’s headwinds are getting worse and investors are becoming less enamoured with the business.\n\n“Competition is fierce, tariffs are biting, the end of tax credits for electric vehicle buyers in the US could hurt, Elon Musk’s political escapades have been a turn-off for many people, and product innovation has failed to make waves.\"\n\nCEO Elon Musk's public feud with US president Donald Trump, following his departure from the Department of Government Efficiency, has weighed on Tesla shares. · Chesnot via Getty Images\n\n\"A push into more affordable vehicles implies a drop in profit margins, while the hope of being big in self-driving cars remains a fantasy rather than reality,\" said Mould. \"The Cybertruck product line hasn’t filled the treasure chest for the company, and for many the Tesla brand has become toxic because of Musk’s outspoken views.\"\n\nTesla shares are already down nearly 18% year-to-date despite rising as CEO Elon Musk stepped back from Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and said he planned to put more time back into the EV company.\n\nMusk's public feud with Trump, following his departure from Washington, has weighed on the stock.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of Tesla vehicles have continued to fall, amid backlash against Musk's political activities, with the company also facing increasing competition from rival EV makers.\n\nIn figures released early in July, Tesla delivered 384,122 vehicles globally in the second quarter, a drop of 13.5% for the same period last year.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) – Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 23 July\n\nSecond-quarter results from Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) topped Wall Street estimates, with revenue of $96.43bn versus expectations of $93.97bn. Earnings were $2.31 per share compared with a Bloomberg consensus estimate of $2.18.\n\nOn a business segment level, advertising revenue came in at $71.3bn versus expectations of $69.6bn. Search revenue topped out at $54.1bn versus an anticipated $52.7bn. YouTube ad revenue was $9.8bn versus expectations of $9.5bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud Platform revenue hit $13.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $13.1bn.\n\nThe company's outlook for capital expenditures (capex), however, was higher than expected. The tech giant expects to spend $85bn in the year, $10bn more than had been previously expected.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nBen Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the concerns around disruption from artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, Alphabet produced a really good set of numbers in its latest results. Revenues were up 15%, three percentage points better than expected and the search business delivered at the top of its range. The cloud business, meanwhile, was also a strong performer with revenues up 32% so it is encouraging to see the business growing strongly in the face of pressures.\"\n\nHe said that the increase in its capex guidance \"is a very solid raise and should be viewed as a positive, with investment looking to drive away the threat of Chat GPT\".\n\n\"Alphabet has been playing catch up somewhat in the AI arms race, but it is doing well to fend off the likes of Chat GPT,\" said Barringer. \"The big question will be whether it can keep innovating at a pace that allows it to maintain its search monopoly. This boost in investment suggests the fight will continue.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the next big event on the horizon for Alphabet's Google is a judge's ruling in an search antitrust case. Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to issue a ruling on \"remedies\" that follows the Justice Department's victory against the company sometime next month.\n\n\"While it is unlikely to be the end of the saga regardless of the result, any indication that its search monopoly will weaken will not be taken well by the market, especially given the AI threat currently,\" said Barringer. \"This ruling has the potential to either be a clearing event or add to Alphabet’s uncertainties. Investors remain very much in wait and see mode as a result and will remain cool on the stock until that ruling makes it clear what the next steps are.\"\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) – Released fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday 30 July\n\nShares in Microsoft (MSFT) popped nearly 5% on Thursday, following the release of its results, seeing it become the second publicly-traded company ever to cross the $4tn market capitalisation mark.\n\nMicrosoft reported revenue of $76.4bn in the fourth quarter compared to expectations of $73.89bn, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $3.65 compared to expectations of $3.37.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes the Azure cloud, produced $29.88bn in revenue in the final quarter. For the entire fiscal year, this AI division saw revenue surge 34% to a record $75bn.\n\nThe company predicted its capital expenditure for the next fiscal year would top $100bn, a 14% increase from the year prior.\n\nRead more: Shell announces further $3.5bn in share buybacks as profits beat estimates\n\nIt’s the fifth quarter in a row that Microsoft has beaten Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nBarringer said that \"while AI demand is clearly helping Microsoft, it isn’t the only game in town for the tech giant. Its cloud business, Azure, saw revenues grow 39%, well ahead of expectations, highlighting that demand for more traditional cloud based services remains strong. Microsoft has a good backlog in this business area too so we should see strong results continue to flow there.\n\n“The company did announce it was slowing the growth of its capex and changing the mix slightly, but as demand remains strong for AI we will likely see the likes of data centres take priority for a number of years yet.\n\nMeta (META) – Released second quarter results on Wednesday 30 July\n\nFacebook-parent Meta (META) surged 12% on Thursday after posting a bumper set of results after the market close on 30 July.\n\nMeta said revenue for the three months to the end of June rose 22% from the same period last year to $47.5bn. Meanwhile, profits jumped by 36% to $18.3bn. Profit per share came in at $7.14, above analysts' estimates.\n\nThe company said it expected its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114bn and $118bn. The company added its AI initiatives will “result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.”\n\n\"I think there are all these questions that people have about what are going to be the timelines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence ... we've observed the more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen. I think that that just continued to happen over the course of this year too,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nReality Labs logged an operating loss of $4.53bn while recording $370m in sales during the same period. This division oversees the Quest line of virtual reality headsets in addition to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company plans to build several massive data centres across the US. · Reuters / Reuters\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Meta has knocked it out of the park. Pick your metric and Meta crushed it, from ad revenue growth to daily users, all the way down to the profit lines.\n\n\"AI is clearly delivering real-world benefits for advertisers, and they're willing to pay more as a result. Average price per ad was up 9% over the quarter, a clear indication that Meta is delivering an improved product for both users and advertisers.\n\n\"The broader focus now turns to Meta's mammoth AI investment plans and whether it can continue to manage those costs without hurting earnings or free cash flow.\n\n\"CFO commentary called out higher costs next year, and another year of similar capex growth, which many analysts did not have on their bingo cards. Clearly, all this spending adds some near-term risks to the bottom line, but Meta looks set to be a clear winner in the AI space over the longer term.\"\n\nApple (AAPL) – Released third-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nInvestors in Apple (AAPL) had a muted response to its latest earnings in after-hours trading following their release, despite a surge in iPhone sales driving record revenue at the Cupertino-based company.\n\nThe company posted better-than-expected 10% growth in revenue year-on-year for the quarter to the end of June and an upbeat forecast.\n\nEarnings of $1.57 per share topped the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $1.43. Revenue of $94.04bn was better than the expected $89.30bn. Mac and iPhone revenue were both better than analysts had anticipated, while wearables and iPad numbers fell short. Greater China revenue was $15.37bn compared to an estimate of $15.19bn.\n\nApple expects tariffs to cost the company $1.1bn this quarter, CEO Tim Cook told investors on the earnings call. That's after the iPhone maker took a tariff-related hit to the tune of $800m during the fiscal third quarter which ran through June.\n\nServices revenue, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Pay, came in at $27.4bn, up about 13% year-on-year, continuing its double-digit growth.\n\nCook said Apple (AAPL) was increasing its AI investments. “We did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter,” he told analysts, without giving specific numbers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook warned in a second quarter earnings call at the beginning of May that tariffs were expected to add $900m to costs in the third quarter. · REUTERS / Reuters\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Britzman said: \"Apple is caught in a sentiment trap. On paper, the company delivered one of its strongest sets of results in recent years – robust iPhone sales, a return to growth in China, and encouraging guidance. Ordinarily, that would send shares meaningfully higher. There’s a sense of unease hanging over Apple, something we haven’t seen in a long time. Scepticism around its AI positioning, combined with lingering tariff uncertainty, continues to weigh on investor confidence.\"\n\n\"Apple should be a leading name in AI hardware, but that’s simply not the case,\" he added. \"Apple Intelligence was a flop, so a lot of hope now lies in an AI-powered Siri – but that might not come until next year. Brand loyalty gives Apple time to get the AI transition right, but it needs to start delivering.\"\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – Released second-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nShares in Amazon (AMZN) fell on the back of its second quarter results, as its outlook for operating income fell short of investor expectations.\n\nThe tech company beat estimates with its revenue up 13.3% year over year to $167.7bn. Market experts had estimated the company would report around $162bn in revenue and 9% growth. The company’s Amazon Web Services cloud computing division reported its sales reached $30.9bn in an increase of 17.5% year over year.\n\nHowever, Amazon projected that operating income in the third quarter would be $15.5bn-$20.5bn, which fell short of analyst expectations of $19.4bn.\n\nChief executive Andy Jassy warned of further uncertainty around Trump’s tariff policies and said he remained “unsure” who would absorb potentially higher costs over time.\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nHe also gave a clear indication that the e-commerce giant will continue its AI push. \"AI is going to be the biggest transformation of our lifetime,” he said during a call with analysts on Thursday. “Every single area of the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by AI.\"\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Just as it looked as if investors were ready to go all-in to big tech again, Amazon has come along and spoiled the party. A negative reaction to its results and a lacklustre response to Apple’s numbers would suggest the market has become more discerning.\"\n\n\"It is spending big on AI infrastructure, leading to more subdued profit guidance than expected,\" he said. \"The retail side of its business is caught up in Trump’s spiderweb of tariffs, which creates ongoing uncertainty.\"\n\n“Competition remains fierce for cloud computing services and Amazon’s sales growth rate is struggling to match rivals Microsoft and Alphabet,\" Coatsworth added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 27 August\n\nAs an enabler of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings have become a major event in the earnings calendar, with some build up to the release of its results as it tends to report later in the season.\n\nInvestor expectations have become increasingly high around Nvidia's earnings, with markets sensitive to any signs of slowdown for the chip giant.\n\nThe stock has seen a marked rebound following turbulence in the first few months of the year amid the DeepSeek AI market shock and Trump's tariff agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed curbs on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China in April. Shares popped last week after the company said that it would resume sales of its H20 chips in China. Nvidia said that the US government had assured the company that licences will be granted, with the chipmaker adding that it hoped to start deliveries soon.\n\nThe recovery in Nvidia shares since mid-April lows has meant the stock is now up 25% year-to-date and recently saw the company become the first publicly traded company to pass the $4tn market capitalisation milestone.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia beat expectations, posting revenue of $44.1bn compared with an expected $43.29bn. The chipmaker guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2% for the second quarter.\n\nGoing into the second-quarter earnings, Britzman warned that investors shouldn't expect \"any meaningful impact\" from the recent turnaround on H20 chip curbs, given the timeframe.\n\n\"However, taking a conservative view, new Chinese sales could drive a $10bn uplift in revenue by year-end, potentially more if things move fast,\" he said. \"NVIDIA may also be able to reverse some of the $4.5bn inventory write-down from the first quarter, providing a direct boost to earnings.\"\n\nHe added: \"Outside of China, overall demand remains critical. Markets have already heard from major customers that data centre expansion is a priority, which should benefit Nvidia.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:43.895680+00:00"}

Over 81% of S&P 500 companies have beaten estimates, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, the highest in seven quarters.\n\nCompanies have produced “an impressive beat,” while also mostly sticking with their projections for the second-half of the year, the Citi team said.

Because a large chunk of its sales comes from data center expenditures, Nvidia investors can look at what some of its largest clients are saying about their capital expenditure plans to determine if Nvidia has a bullish or bearish outlook.\n\nAfter some of the information investors received during the Q2 earnings announcement, it's pretty clear that Nvidia's stock will have another fantastic year. This makes Nvidia a potential buy before Aug. 27, when Nvidia reports its Q2 results.\n\nThe AI hyperscalers are still rapidly building data centers\n\nNvidia's business revolves around selling its graphics processing units (GPUs) and other supporting hardware and software. While GPUs are used in multiple applications, the largest demand by far comes from data centers being built to handle the demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Companies competing in the AI arms race are scrambling to ensure they have enough computing power to handle the workloads and are rapidly building data centers to meet it.\n\nSome of the biggest spenders in this area are Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. All three of these companies have already reported Q2 results and given bullish commentary regarding data center capital expenditures.\n\nStarting with Microsoft, they stated that capital expenditure growth won't be as rapid as it was in fiscal year 2025 (ending June 30), but will still increase for fiscal year 2026.\n\nAlphabet is probably displaying the most aggressive spending behavior of the three, raising its 2025 capital expenditure guidance from $75 billion to $85 billion. While they didn't give details on 2026's capex plans, they mentioned they will further increase this figure to meet customer demand.\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms' capital expenditures are expected to rise $30 billion year over year, with 2025's total expected to be between $66 billion and $72 billion, indicating that its capital expenditures have nearly doubled year over year. For 2026, Meta's management stated, \"We currently expect another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.\"\n\nWith strong guidance appearing for 2026, Nvidia will likely experience an additional year of strong growth as it receives a large chunk of that spend.\n\nHowever, Nvidia also has a growth lever up its sleeve.\n\nNvidia expects China sales to bolster its revenue growth rate moving forward\n\nIn April, Nvidia's China export license was revoked. This crippled sales of its H20 chip, which was specifically designed to meet export regulations. However, Nvidia has reapplied for an export license with assurances from the U.S. government that it will be approved. This is huge news and opens another growth avenue for Nvidia.\n\nFor Q2 of fiscal year 2025 (ended July 27), Nvidia expects 50% revenue growth. However, management estimated that H20 chips would have added around $8 billion in sales during Q2 if their export license hadn't been revoked. If nothing had happened, Nvidia's sales would have been estimated to rise 77% year over year.\n\nWith H20 chip sales likely returning in Q3, this will also bolster Nvidia's growth rate for the next year.\n\nNvidia has several strong tailwinds blowing in its favor that will push its revenue higher. So, if you're worried about Nvidia's growth slowing, I wouldn't be, as all signs point toward Nvidia's growth remaining strong for at least another couple of years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:49.797194+00:00"}

The cohort consists of:\n\nNvidia NVDA 0.58% ) Microsoft MSFT 1.44% ) Apple AAPL 1.13% ) Amazon AMZN 0.08% ) Alphabet GOOG 1.25% ) GOOGL 1.14% ) Meta Platforms META 3.16% ) Tesla TSLA 0.54% )\n\nAll of these companies (except for Nvidia) have reported results, and investors may be curious as to which ones look like solid buys. I think all of these stocks are growing more interesting each day, but of the seven, I think five are a buy and two are to be watched.\n\nI'm keeping an eye on Apple and Tesla\n\nOver the past few years, many of these companies have delivered explosive revenue growth, except for Apple. Apple's growth finally returned in Q3 FY 2025, delivering double-digit growth (if you round up) for the first time since early 2022.\n\nStill, there are some questions about being behind in the AI arms race and what Apple's next big product is. I'm not ready to declare Apple a buy yet, but it's growing more intriguing with each quarter.\n\nTesla is in the worst shape of any Magnificent Seven company, with revenue falling 16% year over year in Q2. Additionally, with EV and regulatory credits getting eliminated, significant headwinds are popping up. However, Tesla's business has never been solely about EVs; otherwise, its valuation wouldn't make sense. An investment in Tesla is a bet that its humanoid robots, AI, self-driving, and rob-taxis will all be successes eventually. But for right now, I'm comfortable waiting on Tesla's situation to improve.\n\nI'm a buyer of the remaining five\n\nThe other five members of the Magnificent Seven all look promising to me, as they're all experiencing strong growth.\n\nMeta Platforms delivered a shocking Q2 report that delivered 22% revenue growth despite only guiding for 13% growth. That strength is expected to continue through Q3, with 20% revenue growth expected.\n\nMeta's advertising business is second to none, and the improvements it's making with AI to aid in ad creation and engagement are starting to pay off.\n\nAlphabet similarly had a strong advertising quarter, despite many investors being worried about Google Search potentially being left behind by generative AI. Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year, showcasing its strength and silencing doubters about its longevity.\n\nCompanywide, Alphabet's revenue rose 14% year over year, with diluted earnings per share rising 22%. That's an impressive result from a company that is supposed to be struggling. Additionally, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading for 20 times forward earnings.\n\nAll of this combines to make Alphabet one of the best stocks to buy right now.\n\nDespite Microsoft being the second-largest company in the world, it delivered monster growth in Q4 FY 2025 (ended June 30). Revenue was up 18% year over year, but the biggest shock in its report was Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing product and is a leading platform for building AI models. Azure's revenue was up a jaw-dropping 39% this quarter, showcasing strong demand for computing power.\n\nThis tailwind will persist for some time, making Microsoft an excellent stock to scoop up now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) investors had a negative reaction to its report, which caused shares to sink following earnings. However, I don't think they were as bad as the market thought, and the long-term outlook is still positive for the company.\n\nAmazon's profit growth continues to outpace revenue growth thanks to the strength of high-margin businesses like advertising and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAs long as this trend continues, Amazon will be a strong long-term pick. With both advertising and AWS being Amazon's fastest-growing segments by far, this trend looks primed to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nLast is Nvidia, which hasn't reported earnings yet. However, all of the companies involved in building out AI infrastructure on this list stated that their capital expenditures will be rising next year due to increased data center spend. This bodes well for Nvidia, as it receives a huge chunk of this spend. Additionally, Nvidia has reapplied for its export license to begin shipping H20 chips to China again, which will provide another growth tailwind for its business.\n\nI expect Nvidia to report blowout earnings on Aug. 27, making the stock a smart stock to scoop up before then. Nvidia may be the world's largest company, but I expect it to get even bigger with increased AI buildout.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:52.996038+00:00"}

U.S. customers like Nvidia, Apple, Google, etc needs and should understand they NEED a second source for their lead product manufacturing due to pricing, geographic stability and supply line security reasons.\n\n4. Intel is cash poor and can’t afford to invest in the capacity needed in the future to replace TSMC or even a reasonable fraction of TSMC capacity.

The current Intel CEO’s comments about not investing in new technology (14A) until customers sign up is a joke. To win in this space you need to be the leader in technology not the follower. It takes multiple years to create one of these technologies and no customer wants to sign up for something that is second best.\n\n7.

Domestic supply, second source, national security, leverage in negotiating with TSMC, etc. AND IF THE USG GETS ITS ACT TOGETHER, they catalyze the action with a 50% (or whatever number Trump picks) tariff on state of the art semi imports.

There are many company interactions that involve both supply and competition. It is also extremely hard to imagine Intel really competing with the likes of Nvidia, Apple, Meta, Google, Dell, etc in their well established product lines. By all means, if you want to complicate the problem, then take the time to split up Intel and make the FFWBMs happy but if you’re in the business of saving Intel and its core manufacturing strength for the USA then solve the real problem – immediate investment in Intel, committed customers, national security, etc.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:54.872259+00:00"}

I mean, they’re not secrets or hacks that are going to triple your post reach overnight, but they might help some within your process.\n\nFirst off, Mosseri recently noted that videos created in Meta’s new “Edits” app do get a little bit of a reach boost when shared to IG.\n\nAs explained by Mosseri:\n\n“For now, Edits does help a little bit with reach. It’s not going to be something that’s going to be around forever. Do not just use Edits to try to pass through content [because] we can check for that. But we are trying to bootstrap the app, and we’ve also found that predicting whether or not you’re going to tap on the ‘Edits’ button is something that we can add to ranking, and therefore hopefully show more of this kind of content to people who are interested in it, and who are going to be interested in the app itself.”\n\nSo Instagram’s trying to get more people aware of the Edits app, and promoting videos created with Edits helps with this. So, right now at least, you will get some form of reach boost when you post videos created in Edits.\n\nAnd with more and more functions coming to the app every week, it’s worth checking out either way.\n\nOn another front, Mosseri has also sought to dispel the myth that you need to engage with content relevant to your own niche/passion/business in order to maximize relevant reach.\n\n“One myth I learned recently about Instagram is that you have to interact with similar content to the content that you create to maximize your reach. That is definitely not the case. It’s great to interact with people in your comments, and with your followers in general, but what you decide to consume is not going to affect who you reach with your content.”\n\nSo the two are not necessarily linked. Sure, engaging with people and profiles that share similar interests is going to make them aware of your profile, and that could help your reach if they then interact with your posts. But from an algorithmic standpoint, Instagram itself is not using what you watch, like, etc. as an indicator of audience relevance.\n\n“Feel free to engage with the content that you love, then try to create content that your followers love.”\n\nI mean, again, there is clearly some benefit to this, in that engaging with people in your niche is going to make them aware of your presence, and that could then lead to more engagement. But it’s not a direct correlation. Instagram isn’t clustering topic-based engagement into certain groups, so whatever you choose to engage with in the app won’t directly impact performance.\n\nSome handy notes, which could help you get your IG process on track.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:56.034450+00:00"}

This quarter, we expanded our new AI-powered recommendation model for ads to new surfaces and improved its performance by using more signals and a longer context. It's driven roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook.”\n\nWorth taking note, then, of Meta’s latest placement tips:\n\n1. Use all placements\n\nMeta says that advertisers should remain opted into all placements across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads and Audience Network using Advantage+ placements.\n\n“This will allow the Meta delivery system to allocate your budget across multiple placements based on where they're likely to perform best.”\n\nSo rather than restricting your campaigns to where you think your audience is active, Meta suggests letting its ad system find the most relevant people across its apps.\n\n2. Use diverse assets\n\nWith Meta’s AI creative elements also evolving, it’s now easier than ever to create multiple creatives for each campaign, which Meta also recommends.\n\n“Use Advantage+ creative in combination with Advantage+ placements to help ensure the right creative is in the right placement to increase the likelihood your ad will resonate with your audience. Consider using placement asset customization to tailor your creative for different placements.”\n\nMeta’s various generative AI tools now enable you to tap into a broad range of ad customization and creation options, and like platform placements, having more creative options to display to different users will help to broaden your opportunities.\n\n3. Use placement controls where needed\n\nFinally, Meta advises that if you have a hard constraint and need more control over where your ads appear, you should use account-level placement controls to exclude specific placements or platforms.\n\n“However, be aware that this may limit the effectiveness of Advantage+ placements.”\n\nSo, really, Meta’s main advice is that you should look to utilize its various AI tools to maximize your opportunities, and only restrict them if you really have to. Because if you let its AI targeting tools do their thing, that should drive better performance.\n\nAnd eventually, Meta’s view is that its AI systems will be able to take care of your entire ad process, from creation to targeting to bidding, with you only needing to upload your URL for context.\n\nWe’re not there yet, but Meta is confident that its AI-powered ad systems will get you better results.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:04:57.195171+00:00"}

We hear about these storylines every single day in finance media.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRenaissance Macro’s Neil Dutta caught this incredible development in the most recent GDP report.\n\n\"So far this year, AI capex, which we define as information processing equipment plus software, has added more to GDP growth than consumers' spending,\" Dutta said.\n\nAI capex is contributing more to GDP growth than personal consumption. (Source: Sherwood, Renaissance Macro)\n\nWhat’s so impressive about this is how small AI capex is in the context of the economy.\n\n\"The U.S. consumer makes up about 70% of the economy,\" Sherwood’s Kawa noted about the stats. \"Over the long term, that’s been the undisputed engine of growth. But these two segments that make up 6% of GDP have been playing a bigger role in fueling the expansion so far this year, on average.\"\n\nIn other words, a relatively small slice of the economy is growing so fast that it’s become the dominant growth story for the whole economy.\n\nReview of the macro crosscurrents 🔀\n\nThere were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our last review:\n\n👎 Inflation expectations heat up.

According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.63% from 6.72% last week. From Freddie Mac: \"The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to its lowest level since April. The decline in rates increases prospective homebuyers’ purchasing power, and Freddie Mac research shows that buyers can save thousands by getting quotes from a few different lenders.\"\n\n(Source: Freddie Mac)\n\nThere are 147.9 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.1 million are owner-occupied and about 39% are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows.

Until we get more clarity, here’s where things stand:\n\nEarnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nBut growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.\n\nActions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nStocks are not the economy: There’s a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nMind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nInvesting is never a smooth ride: There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nThink long-term: For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:05:07.151130+00:00"}

But this one just might become the biggest AI winner in the group.\n\nHave you ever heard of the \"Mgnfcent Seven\" stocks? Of course not. There's no such thing. But you might have picked up on where I'm going. You can't spell \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks without AI (artificial intelligence).\n\nMore importantly, none of the members of this elite group of stocks would be nearly as attractive to investors without their AI-related growth prospects. Which is the best AI pick among the so-called Magnificent Seven right now? Here are three arguments in support of Meta Platforms (META 3.16%).\n\n1. Already seeing solid ROI on its AI initiatives\n\nImportantly, Meta is already seeing a solid return on investment (ROI) on its AI initiatives. For example, in the company's second-quarter update, CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned some recent improvements to Meta's AI-powered recommendation model to show people content they like. He said the changes \"have improved quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram just this quarter.\"\n\nMore users spending more time on Meta's top social media apps is likely to attract more advertisers. But Zuckerberg highlighted an even more tangible way that AI is delivering ROI for the company. Changes to Meta's recommendation model boosted ad conversions in Q2 by roughly 5% on Instagram and by 3% on Facebook.\n\nZuckerberg also revealed that \"a meaningful percent\" of Meta's ad revenue is now coming from advertisers using the company's generative AI capabilities. These genAI features should especially appeal to smaller advertisers who can't afford to spend as much on their marketing campaigns.\n\nPerhaps the clearest sign of the positive ROI Meta is enjoying from its AI initiatives is the company's plan to invest even more. CFO Susan Li said in the Q2 call, \"We continue to see very compelling returns from our AI capacity investments in our core ads and organic engagement initiatives, and expect to continue investing significantly there in 2026.\"\n\n2. The leader in AI glasses\n\nWhat's the next big thing in AI? It just might be AI glasses. These devices can see everything a person wearing them sees. They can hear everything the person hears. There's arguably no better way to integrate AI into every aspect of daily life. And Meta has already established itself as the market leader in AI glasses.\n\nSales of the company's Ray-Ban Meta glasses continue to soar and accelerated in Q2. Even with Meta ramping up production earlier this year, it still can't make enough of the AI glasses to meet customer demand. The new Oakley Meta HSTN performance AI glasses have the makings of another huge commercial success.\n\nMeta's Orion prototype showed the potential for true augmented reality embedded into glasses. The company will probably incorporate similar technology into its AI glasses products in the not-too-distant future. Zuckerberg hinted in the Q2 call, though, that a smaller display that shows limited information without the full augmented reality (AR) capabilities might come first.\n\n3. A superintelligence lottery ticket\n\nLast, but not least, Meta offers investors something like an AI lottery ticket with its investment in superintelligence. While several companies are scrambling to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) technology that can match humans, Zuckerberg wants Meta to lead the way in making superintelligence that's smarter than humans a reality.\n\nThe company is taking its superintelligence efforts quite seriously. It's investing heavily in bringing the most accomplished AI experts into the fold. Zuckerberg said in the Q2 earnings call that he views \"small talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research.\"\n\nWhat are the odds that this lottery ticket pays off? It's hard to say. However, Zuckerberg recently shared a letter outlining his vision for these efforts that said, \"[D]eveloping superintelligence is now in sight.\" He told analysts in the Q2 call, \"[W]e think that this [superintelligence] is going to really shape all of our systems sooner rather than later, not necessarily on the trajectory of a quarter or two, but on the trajectory of a few years.\"\n\nIf Meta achieves Zuckerberg's goal and is the first to market with superintelligence technology, the company will almost certainly grow much larger than its current market cap of a little under $2 trillion. And if that happens, Meta will probably be the biggest AI winner in the Magnificent Seven.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:05:10.407110+00:00"}

The difference between spreads on individual bonds and the average of the index is the lowest on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2009.\n\nRisk premiums are low for top-notch and weaker companies alike. In junk bonds the spread variability, or dispersion, is at its lowest since right before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nInvestors looking to juice their returns now typically have to take on a lot more risk for not much extra yield. When a client asked Insight Investment’s April LaRusse for ways to boost spreads without materially amplifying potential losses in recent weeks, she didn’t have an immediate answer.\n\n“It’s certainly not easy to find ways to get more yield without introducing different risk,” said the head of investment specialists in an interview. “It’s pretty tricky. When you get tight spreads, you get a lot less dispersion.”\n\nThe growth of both credit index and fixed-maturity funds probably plays a role here: investors are increasingly just buying most of the market, flattening out the differences in bonds’ yields. The lack of variability makes it difficult to find bargains.\n\nMassive inflows have swamped corporate bond funds recently as investors chase securities offering higher yields than Treasuries, even if spreads are relatively tight. Insurance companies have also been packaging company debt into annuities to sell to the growing number of US retirees.\n\nMeanwhile, the average risk premium for global high-grade bonds stood at 82 basis points on Thursday, close to its tightest level since before the global financial crisis, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It’s not much different in the junk-rated market, where spreads are roughly a quarter of a percentage point away from the post-crisis lows set in February.\n\nThere are reasons for investors to be cautious about amping up risk to boost returns.

You’ll no longer be able to use GPT-4o or any other GPT version. But OpenAI says you shouldn’t be too concerned about that.\n\nThat’s because GPT-5 can automatically switch between providing quick, efficient answers to queries and taking time to reason longer over more complex questions, depending on how you ask them. It’s a helpful feature, to be sure, since you don’t have to take the time to decide whether you’re using the right model for your particular ask.\n\nIf you’re a Plus or Team user, you also have the option of selecting GPT-5 Thinking as your base model. But free users are out of luck. When you run through your usage limit, ChatGPT will automatically switch to smaller, less resource-intensive GPT-5 models.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, GPT-5 offers enhanced writing skills that include more literary depth and rhythm. It can also help you translate information from things like complex medical reports into plain English, making them far easier to understand. Of course, the model isn’t bulletproof, so you’ll want to double-check any medical information and run it by your doctor before making any decisions.\n\nThe ChatGPT 5 logo is displayed on a mobile phone.

And unlike previous versions of GPT, GPT-5 gives your apps a bit of stylistic flair, rather than making them feel dull and flat.\n\nThat should prove helpful for the types of folks who are interested in “vibe coding,” or writing software using natural language prompts rather than actual code.\n\nGPT-5 is also more personal thanks to its ability to connect to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Calendar, Gmail, and Contacts. In one demo, OpenAI showed how GPT-5 can help pull together a schedule based on your calendar and travel information from your email. It’s the kind of helpfulness that is certain to attract some users, while turning off others who prefer to keep their more sensitive data private and away from third-party apps.\n\nImportantly, OpenAI says GPT-5 is less sycophantic than its predecessors. The company originally released an update to GPT-4o in April but quickly pulled it back after the chatbot began being overly flattering to users. It also, the company said, was validating users’ doubts, fueling anger, and urging impulsive actions.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:05:16.031653+00:00"}

Meta Platforms (META 3.16%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%), Amazon (AMZN 0.08%), and Apple (AAPL 1.13%) all reported second-quarter earnings, and while they were mostly positive in different ways, artificial intelligence (AI) continued to be a strong trend. That's great news for Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) investors. Let's see what's happening and why investors should get excited about what Nvidia will have to say when it reports quarterly earnings later this month.\n\nWinning with AI\n\nAI has become an enormous growth driver for tech companies, and really all kinds of companies. It unlocks productivity and aids in creativity in ways that make it essential if a company doesn't want to be left behind.\n\nAmazon said that its AI business through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division continues to grow at triple digits year over year, \"with more demand than we have supplied for at the moment.\" It's launching all sorts of new features as demand grows and changes, and releasing powerful new tools aimed at developers creating large language models and in need of the highest-power AI chips. It also boasted that it rolled out new EC2 instances, a type of virtual server on the AWS cloud supported by new Nvidia Blackwell \"super chips,\" the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) on AWS.\n\nAmazon spent $31.4 billion on capital expenditures, which it says is a reasonable estimate for the back half of the year. Although that could be in many parts of the business, it said the AI business is where most of it is going. That means it could be spending even more than the original $100 billion it said it would spend in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft boasted that its Azure cloud business is grabbing market share, up 34% year over year in the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter (ended June 30), and that it now has 400 data centers, the most of any other cloud business. Management highlighted that while there's industry talk about the first gigawatt or multi-gigawatt data centers, it launched two gigawatts of power in its data centers over the past 12 months, and it's scaling faster than the competition.\n\nAt Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed many exciting developments in AI, including the launch of Meta Superintelligence Labs, which combines all of the company's AI efforts, and progress on upgrades to its Llama LLMs. In April, Nvidia announced its own involvement in the new Llama developments. Zuckerberg said Meta is working on the next generation of products \"that will push the frontier in the next\n\nyear or so.\" Meta has made headlines over the last few weeks as it crafts a team of AI specialists it's been pulling from rival companies.\n\nApple continues to disappoint, or at least confuse, investors with its AI developments. It's taking its time to develop an AI infrastructure that rivals the competition, and it's questionable whether or not it's losing ground or if it's going to eventually release something different and special, which is its signature. Management said it's making substantial investments in AI and that its capital expenditures are going to increase.\n\nAlthough investors seemed disappointed in Apple's AI updates, there's no question that it provided an excellent report, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines, and it's likely to report progress in Apple Intelligence over the coming quarters.\n\nDriving AI\n\nThe common denominator here is Nvidia, which partners with all of these companies. It provides the power for Amazon's and Microsoft's clientele to develop potent LLMs and AI agents, and they also use Nvidia GPUs for the data centers that drive their own LLMs. Meta uses Nvidia's GPUs for its own LLMs and AI agents, and Apple partners with Nvidia for its AI business as well.\n\nNvidia is guiding for sales to increase about 50% over last year in the fiscal second quarter, which it will report on Aug. 27. Its quarterly results usually beat guidance, but with the success and continued capital investments of its top-tier clients, it's very likely that it will beat sales guidance and give shareholders a strong outlook.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:05:17.553561+00:00"}

And investors have started placing bets on just where that disruption will occur next, ditching shares in companies some strategists expect will see falloffs in demand as AI applications become more widely adopted.\n\nAmong them are web-development firms like Wix.com Ltd., digital-image company Shutterstock Inc. and software maker Adobe Inc. The trio are part of a basket of 26 companies Bank of America strategists identified as most at risk from AI. The group has underperformed the S&P 500 Index by about 22 percentage points since mid-May after more or less keeping pace with the market since ChatGPT’s debut in late 2022.\n\n“The disruption is real,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the Futurum Group. “We thought it would happen over five years. It seems like it is going to happen over two. Service-based businesses with a high headcount, those are going to be really vulnerable, even if they have robust businesses from the last era of tech.”\n\nSo far, few companies have failed as a result of the proliferation of chatbots and so-called agents that can write software code, answer complex questions and produce photos and videos. But with tech giants like Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. pouring hundreds of billions into AI, investors have started to get more defensive.\n\nWix.com and Shutterstock are down at least 33% in 2025, compared with a 8.6% advance for the broad benchmark. Adobe has fallen 23% amid concerns clients will look to AI platforms that can generate images and videos, as Coca-Cola has already done with an AI-generated ad. ManpowerGroup Inc., whose staffing services could be hurt by rising automation, is down 30% this year, while peer Robert Half Inc. has shed more than half its value, dropping to its lowest in more than five years.\n\nThe souring sentiment among investors comes as AI is changing everything from the way people get information from the internet to how colleges function. Even companies at the vanguard of the technology’s development like Microsoft have been slashing jobs as productivity improves and to make way for more AI investments. To many tech-industry watchers, the time is nearing when AI becomes so pervasive that companies start going out of business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:05:19.390200+00:00"}

Reddit's (RDDT 1.40%) website doesn't feature flashy graphics or funky designs; rather, it's a set of online discussions about almost any topic imaginable.\n\nThis outwardly mundane presentation hides a high-potential operation that has more than proved it can deliver the goods for investors. Given that, I think the stock price growth of the dowdy-looking Reddit can trounce that of social media peers Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Snap (NYSE: SNAP) over the coming year.\n\nThe social media rock star of the moment\n\nThe excitement over Reddit across the past few days stems from its second-quarter earnings report, published Friday morning to a thunderously positive reception by the market (which sent the share price more than 21% skyward in morning trading alone).\n\nRevenue surged 78% higher on a year-over-year basis to $500 million, powered by all-important ad sales that rose 84% to $465 million. The bottom line according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) flipped to a well-in-the-black profit of $89 million, against a $10 million deficit in the same quarter of 2024. Free cash flow (FCF) ballooned by $84 million across that stretch to $111 million. Both headline figures blew past analyst estimates.\n\nAs for operational metrics, the company's count for daily active uniques (DAUq) -- users that it defines as those \"whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on the Reddit website ... or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period\" -- leaped by 21% year over year to over 21 million souls. How's that for engagement?\n\nReddit's guidance for its current (third) quarter was similarly impressive. It's projecting $535 million to $545 million for revenue, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $185 million to $195 million. Analysts were anticipating a top line of barely over $473 million.\n\nThe right site at the right time\n\nSo, what's the secret sauce for Reddit?\n\nSure, management has launched several clever, growth-fueling initiatives, including dynamic product ads (DPA), rolled out in May. These spots match topics of the site's \"subreddits,\" and embed within them to serve users who are obviously or apparently looking to buy such products/services. In the ideal case, the ads are doubly beneficial, as a shopper in need of guidance gets a tailored recommendation, and a theoretically ideal consumer is targeted by an advertiser.\n\nAlso in the realm of ads, Reddit is future-forward with its embrace of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for ad creation. With these, an advertiser can garner real-time information on trends in the discussion threads, plus integrate positive user comments into the ads themselves.\n\nBut I don't believe Reddit's big leaps are mostly due to these (admittedly impressive) technologies. Rather, I think it's more a function of what the company offers as a service. With the ability to generate meaningful discussion about almost anything and provide answers for a near-limitless variety of questions or concerns, Reddit is growing in both authority and utility.\n\nAs successful as Meta's Facebook and Instagram and Snap's offerings have been, they're not really venues for information swapping or edification. They're fun places to share things with friends and acquaintances. However, you would be hard-pressed to quickly access an effective informational discussion on the history of the Habsburg Empire.\n\nI think analysts tracking social media and big-tech stocks have cottoned on to this. They're modeling nearly 60% (!) annual growth for Reddit on the top line for full-year 2025, with a 31% boost in 2026. The collective estimate for per-share profitability is $1.86, a night-and-day improvement over a $3.33 loss in 2024. That should balloon by 61% (!!) in 2026.\n\nNeither revenue nor profitability are expected to surge anywhere near that high for Meta from 2025 to 2026. Analysts forecast Snap will improve its bottom line by 42% across that stretch, but with revenue growth of 11%.\n\nHigh performance attracts investors, of course, so Reddit's valuations are comparatively much higher than its social media cousins (a dizzying 121 forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, against Snap's under 37, and Meta's sub-29). Yet this company has clearly captured the zeitgeist and possesses the user stickiness, the resources, and the managerial acumen to keep up those massive growth rates.\n\nOf that trio, then, I would unhesitatingly buy Reddit stock.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:05:23.036802+00:00"}

There are official distinctions, like S&P 500 components versus those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but there are also more nuanced groupings, like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, etc.\n\nSometimes, investors will get a little whimsical and come up with catchy names to describe red-hot, winning stocks. The \"Nifty Fifty\" was a popular term for large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nJim Cramer used \"FANG\" to describe Facebook (now Meta Platforms (META 3.16%)), Amazon (AMZN 0.08%), Netflix (NFLX 0.55%), and Google (now Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%)). It eventually expanded to \"FAANG\" to include Apple (AAPL 1.13%).\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the largest seven technology-focused companies: Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (TSLA 0.54%).\n\nBut the Magnificent Seven has its problems, which is why I'm introducing the \"Ten Titans\" -- the Magnificent Seven plus Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), Oracle (ORCL 0.27%), and Netflix.\n\nHere's why the Ten Titans is a better representation of top growth stocks than the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe Broadcom blunder\n\nThe biggest flaw of the Magnificent Seven is that it doesn't include Broadcom. It's up about 450% in the last three years, which has pole-vaulted its market cap well over $1 trillion.\n\nBased on market cap, it deserves to be included in the Magnificent Seven over Tesla. However, some folks may prefer the diversification that Tesla brings to the table with electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). And some may argue that it's redundant to include both Nvidia and Broadcom since they're both chip giants, but Broadcom has a much different business than Nvidia.\n\nNvidia generates the vast majority of its profits by selling graphics processing units and associated hardware and software to data centers. Like Nvidia, Broadcom makes AI chips, and AI is its fastest-growing segment, making up around 30% of total revenue in its latest quarter. But the bulk of Broadcom's business is not directly tied to AI.\n\nEnd markets include networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, infrastructure software, and more. In fact, Broadcom was considered a dividend-paying value stock before its recent boom -- similar to another high-yield semiconductor stalwart, Texas Instruments.\n\nAnother \"value\" stock turned growth stock\n\nNot long ago, Oracle was seen more as a mature tech stock with an entrenched legacy business and limited upside potential. Investors were more excited about hotter software stocks like Salesforce, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Palo Alto Networks. However, Oracle has completely transformed its business, integrating cloud infrastructure as a complement to its foothold in database software and enterprise applications.\n\nOracle has carved out a growing role in the cloud that is uniquely different from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle's hybrid and multicloud strategy integrates with the major cloud players, which allows customers to use Oracle's database advantages even if they're with another cloud provider.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers some advantages over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, including lower prices in some cases, more AI tools, and vertical integration with the company's other database services.\n\nSome drawbacks of OCI are that it has a smaller ecosystem with fewer preset tools for developers. However, Oracle is growing faster than the major players with a 27% year-over-year cloud revenue increase in its most recent quarter, including a 52% rise in cloud infrastructure revenue.\n\nLike Broadcom, Oracle is a great addition to the Ten Titans because it's a highly diversified company that's playing a growing role in AI.\n\nFAANG's anchor is a worthy addition to the Ten Titans\n\nNetflix was an integral part of FANG and FAANG, but it fell out of favor for a while as it underperformed the broad market. The streaming company is now worth around half a trillion dollars, which has catapulted it to the top 20 S&P 500 companies by market cap.\n\nNetflix has pulled back from its recent highs, but the stock has still crushed the S&P 500 year to date. A big reason for its rebound in recent years is its improved cost management and more purposeful spending.\n\nA major problem with the business in the past was the boom-and-bust nature of its earnings. The company would steadily grow subscribers, but it would overspend on content and have dry spells without major success.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix spent most of the 2010s being inconsistently profitable. But over the last five years, profits have skyrocketed and its operating margin continues to climb in lockstep with revenue.\n\nThe company has revolutionized entertainment and remains the gold standard in streaming, despite tons of new competition. A lot of that success comes down to its ability to balance the quantity and quality of content it produces.\n\nIt's time to add some all-stars to the team\n\nExpanding the Magnificent Seven to the Ten Titans corrects for the blatant error of Broadcom's omission and includes massively important growth stocks in Oracle and Netflix. Over the next three to five years, it wouldn't be surprising if all of the Titans were worth over $1 trillion due to their industry leadership and runways for growth.\n\nWith a combined weighting of 37.7% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans offer investors a useful way to track the top growth stocks that can really move the major indexes and keep tabs on prevailing themes that are driving the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:05:24.367437+00:00"}

They’ve done smaller deals, but this week they caught the biggest fish yet: a $29 billion financing package for Meta Platforms Inc.’s massive data center in Louisiana.\n\nThat transaction, led by Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc., hits all the high notes: It’s a top-notch business in a hot sector. It disrupts the usual route that companies like Meta travel to get money from investors through banks. And, it’s huge.\n\n“Private credit has been itching to get into this space,” said John Medina, senior vice president on the global project and infrastructure finance team at Moody’s Ratings. “This deal is one of the first of its kind for private credit and if it is successful, we would expect to see more.”\n\nThe biggest technology companies are in an AI arms race now, and they need cash to win. Elon Musk’s xAI Corp. recently told investors it plans to spend $18 billion on data centers, and is looking at raising debt backed by projects rather than at the corporate level. Others including Amazon.com Inc. and OpenAI Inc. are pursuing their own sites across the US. Morgan Stanley estimates that capital expenditures on AI could exceed $3 trillion in the next three years.\n\nFor Meta, Pimco is leading $26 billion in debt and Blue Owl is providing $3 billion in equity. The debt portion is likely to be issued in the form of investment-grade bonds backed by the data center’s assets, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the final structure is still in flux. Morgan Stanley is advising Meta on the deal and arranging the financing.\n\nThe bidding war for the financing lasted months. It was competitive because private credit firms have been all-but-begging for access to the investment-grade debt world that banks dominate. Other private credit firms that grappled for the top spot include Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co., which made it to the final round, as well as Brookfield Asset Management Ltd., Blackstone Inc. and Ares Management Corp., said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:05:26.271403+00:00"}

Earnings slightly missed estimates while a recent rally for Pinterest stock and strong Q2 results from social media rivals Meta Platforms (META) and Reddit (RDDT) raised expectations.\n\n\"Following a 59% rebound in stock price after the selloff following Liberation Day, Pinterest is giving back roughly 10% after-hours tonight, largely because digital ad expectations have been building through earnings season,\" New Street Research analyst Dan Salmon wrote to clients following Pinterest's Thursday report.\n\nSan Francisco-based Pinterest earned an adjusted 33 cents per share for the June-ended quarter, up 37.5% compared to the same period a year earlier. That was short of the 35 cents per share that analysts polled by FactSet forecast. Sales increased 17% to $998 million, beating analyst estimates of $975 million.\n\nFor the current quarter, Pinterest guided for sales of $1.04 billion at the midpoint of its range, coming in just ahead of previous analyst forecasts. Total monthly active users for Pinterest grew 11% to 578 million. That beat estimates of 574.5 million.\n\n\"I've never been more confident in Pinterest's ability to deliver for our users and advertisers,\" Pinterest Chief Executive Bill Ready said in a news release. \"We've found our best product market fit ever by becoming a personalized shopping destination for users and an AI-powered performance platform for advertisers.\"\n\nOn the stock market today, Pinterest stock is down more than 8% at 35.85 in recent trading.\n\nPinterest's Growth Strategy\n\nOn a call with analysts Thursday, Ready touted that AI tools from Pinterest are improving the \"actionability\" of its advertising. Ready took over Pinterest's top job in June 2022 and has focused on helping drive more shopping directly from the platform, which often has users sharing fashion and home-design images.\n\nOffering stronger advertising based on those interests could help Pinterest compete against Facebook and Instagram for performance-based advertising, where advertisers pay based on outcomes such as clicking though to a product page. A big part of that strategy is a partnership struck in 2023 with Amazon.com (AMZN) to display Amazon product ads on Pinterest feeds.\n\nPinterest last year struck a similar deal with Alphabet (GOOGL) to display ads purchased through Google in international markets. Pinterest's user base is growing fastest outside the U.S. and Canada but it has struggled to monetize its international presence. The average Pinterest user in the U.S. and Canada brought $7.29 in revenue, compared to an average of $1.74 in revenue per users in the rest of the world. The Google deal is part of an effort to boost its international monetization.\n\nThat combination of strategies has helped Pinterest win support among Wall Street analysts.\n\n\"We think shares are attractive owing to a clear strategy and consistent execution on multiple growth levers, combined with a reasonable valuation and lower risk profile than other mid-size social media platforms,\" New Street Research's Salmon wrote to clients Thursday. He rates the stock a buy.\n\nPinterest Stock: Tariffs Hit E-Commerce Advertising\n\nEarlier this week, shares of Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) took a big hit after its revenue growth came up short. Analysts compared Snap's growth to the strong performances from the much-larger Meta Platforms, as well as the rapid growth of Reddit's relatively new digital ad business. Each of the companies is competing for digital advertising spending.\n\nPinterest is up against the same comparisons. It is \"hard to keep up with ad Joneses\" as Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a client note Thursday.\n\nHe rates Pinterest as outperform, or buy. But the Bernstein analyst noted that Pinterest's 11% U.S. advertising growth was a slowdown from the 12% in Q1.\n\n\"The 3Q revenue guide of 15%-17% growth was fine in isolation, though lagged more optimistic peer guidance,\" Shmulik added. \"Investors dreaming of a hockey-stick like inflection may want to look elsewhere.\"\n\nWhile tariffs haven't hit the digital advertising market as badly as investors once feared, Pinterest acknowledged they are feeling some effects.\n\n\"Asia-based e-commerce retailers pulled back spend in the U.S. tied to the change in the de minimis exemption,\" Pinterest Chief Financial Officer Julia Donnelly told analysts Thursday.\n\nPinterest Stock Jumps 35%\n\nComing into trading Friday, Pinterest shares had gained 35% year to date.\n\nOverall, Pinterest's share performance has been uneven though this year. The stock jumped out to a big gain after Pinterest's fourth quarter results impressed investors in February. But shares then slumped in the spring, as investors debated the impact of tariffs on the digital advertising market.\n\nPinterest stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating.

The funding package comes as Meta aggressively scales its infrastructure to support AI services, including generative AI and superintelligence projects.\n\nThis deal builds on Meta's previously reported discussions with private credit powerhouses like Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR), Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM), and Carlyle Group (NASDAQ:CG). These firms remain bullish on private, asset-backed investments, especially in the growing data center space.\n\nIn July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized Meta's intent to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure over the next few years.

During the press conference Wednesday, Trump largely brushed aside a reporter’s question about whether iPhones will be made in the US, saying that Apple isn’t making the investments that it’s making in the US anywhere else. He later added that the administration may eventually incentivize the company to build in America.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook during a press event in the Oval Office.

Cook met with Trump a number of times throughout his first term in office and made investment commitments in the US that helped spare Apple from the worst of Trump’s levies.\n\nIn 2017, Apple announced its Advanced Manufacturing Fund aimed at investing $1 billion in US companies, including $200 million for Corning’s Harrodsburg, Ky., plant. That’s the same facility Apple committed $2.5 billion to during its press event Wednesday.\n\nIn January 2018, as Trump threatened a trade war, Apple again came forward with a plan to invest in the US. This time, the company said it would contribute $350 billion to the economy via new investments and spending at domestic suppliers and manufacturers.

But the market is now counting on the AI boom continuing.\n\nFund investors enjoyed gains. Still, the average U.S. diversified equity fund's 1.5% July advance and 4.7% year-to-date gain trails the S&P 500's 2.24% return in July and 2025 gain of 8.59%, according to Lipper Refinitiv data.\n\nStock Market Tests Highs\n\nThe S&P 500 finished with 10 new highs in July, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The rally took flight with President Donald Trump inking trade deals with Vietnam, the European Union and Japan. Better-than-expected profit reports from AI leaders Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) near month-end also breathed life into the bullish AI investment trend.\n\n\"There was a lot of big expectations going into earnings season,\" said Doug Rogers, manager of Eaton Vance Focused Growth Opportunities Fund (EIFGX). \"I think those expectations were largely met, especially on the AI side.\"\n\nBut storm clouds appeared at the end of July and early August when Trump followed through with higher tariffs on other trading partners. A weak July jobs report also gave investors pause, raising concerns about the health of the economy and reigniting a debate about Federal Reserve interest rate policy.\n\nLooking At Sector Winners\n\nFrom a sector standpoint, utility funds won big in July. They surged 4.36%. Rising demand for energy to power data centers and the AI buildout has driven utility funds to a 12.9% year-to-date gain. The other big sector winner are industrials funds. They gained 2.96% to extend their 2025 gain to 15.68%, the best year-to-date gain of all sectors. Industrials got a lift from Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" The bill included an array of tax incentives to spur U.S. manufacturing growth, as well as more expected infrastructure business related to AI.\n\n\"It's a little bit of the picks and shovels sort of argument,\" said Rogers. \"You've had HVAC companies doing very well just building out the cooling for the data centers. And you have to supply power to the data centers. So, utilities have been working well, too.\"\n\nScience and technology funds were up 2.62% in July, stretching their 2025 gain to 11.84%.\n\nAI Is A Big Stock Market Force\n\nThe AI boom continues to be a tailwind for the U.S. stock market. The large hyperscalers and megacap techs — Microsoft, Meta, Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Broadcom (AVGO) — continue to spend heavily on AI chips, AI-focused software, and other related technologies to bolster the next wave of growth, says Rogers.\n\nRogers notes that capital expenditures by the five top hyperscalers were less than $200 billion at the beginning of 2024 and estimates are for $422 billion by the end of this year. \"Those are big, big numbers,\" said Rogers.\n\nThat spending, Rogers says, feeds into the tech ecosphere and other sectors of the economy, fueling growth. \"That's a lot of revenue to be spread around a lot of different sectors,\" said Rogers. \"It's a little bit of a rising tide lifts all boats story.\"\n\nFor the market to continue to trade upward, AI must continue to be a tailwind, says Rogers.\n\n\"It's hard to see a market that works well, that doesn't include continued growth in the AI space,\" said Rogers. A big reason is the Magnificent Seven stocks now account for a huge weighting in key market benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000 Growth index, where the seven megatechs make up more than 50% of the index.\n\nWhat's Next For AI?\n\nRogers says there is a big catalyst coming for AI in August, most notably the Aug. 27 quarterly earnings report from AI chipmaker and $4 trillion market-cap company Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAs has been the case for some time now, big companies and growth stocks outpaced smaller stocks and value names.\n\nLarge-cap growth funds gained 2.94% in July, pushing their 2025 gain to 10.02%. In contrast, large-cap value funds rose just 0.74% last month and are up just 7.56% for the year. Small-cap growth funds rose 1.38% in July to put them up 0.2% for the year.\n\nVanguard Growth Index ETF (VUG) rallied 3.75% in July and is now up 11.06% in 2025. In contrast, Vanguard Value Index ETF (VTV), eked out a 0.16% gain last month and is up only 5.7% this year.\n\nDiversification In Stock Market\n\nDiversifying abroad was more of a mixed bag in July, although the average world equity fund's 15.03% year-to-date gain through July tops the S&P 500's 8.59% rise and the average U.S. diversified fund's 4.7% advance.\n\nLast month's foreign stock winners included China region funds. They gained 3.94% to extend their 2025 gain to 17.48%. Despite a 2.44% drop last month, European region funds still sport solid gains of 22.02% for the year. European equities have come back into favor as Germany and other European allies boost their defense spending.\n\nBond fund investors eked out gains or suffered minor losses. General domestic taxable bond funds inched 0.2% higher in July and are now up 3.91% on the year. High yield bond funds, which invest in companies with lower credit ratings and therefore typically have higher yields than investment grade bonds, rose 0.47% last month. High-yield funds are up 4.59% on the year. So-called core bond funds, which invest in a diversified basket of investment-grade bonds, dipped 0.22% in July, trimming their year-to-date gain to 3.8%.\n\nVanguard Total Bond ETF (BND) fell 0.3% in July but is still up a solid 3.73% on the year. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate (AGG) dipped 0.25% in July but is 3.75% higher on the year.\n\nBonds Regain Footing\n\nThe big news for bond investors, however, came on Aug. 1 in the form of a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, according to Thomas Urano, co-chief investment officer, managing partner at Sage Advisory.\n\n\"This jobs number and restatement kind of reset the way the market is thinking about the labor market,\" said Urano. It calls into question the strength of the economy and job market. And that could pave the way for Federal Reserve rate cuts. \"The rate cuts are coming,\" said Urano.\n\nA big catalyst for markets in the months ahead could be more certainty on the policy front, Rogers says. \"If there's any resolution to all the uncertainty, I think that helps drive markets higher,\" said Rogers.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nThis Popular Investment Is Doomed To 'Lost Decade,' Research Says\n\nMissed The AI Bonanza? 12 Stocks Drive The Coming Quantum Boom", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:04.498504+00:00"}

OpenAI’s GPT-5 is live and free! You can read all about Sam Altman’s latest LLM model and what this does to its competition with Google and Meta here. How will it impact all the entrepreneurs and business leaders who are building business models around these ever-changing technologies? The answer may be, “not much.”\n\nI spoke with serial entrepreneur Geoff Nudd yesterday, whose startup Anonymous Health deploys AI to help people overcome addiction and unwanted habits. Launched in June, it now serves more than 10,000 users. While Nudd is pleased to have access to more intelligence, he likens the update to the “heyday of semiconductors, where you always want to be planning for what’s going to be out there in 18 months.”\n\nNudd argues there are five main components to delivering value: the LLM, the context, the prompt, the workflow and the evaluation. “It’s those five things working together in concert that really create magic,” he says. “The frontier models are effectively commoditized. How you create value goes back to those other four components.”\n\n“Folks like us will go to whatever is cheapest at some point, because they’re all basically the same,” he added. “If I have the system of record for the industry, plus touch points into other systems, then I have the broadest possible context.”\n\nHis advice: Seek breadth in your systems, go deep in understanding your customer and deploy new capabilities with purpose. Nudd’s model, for example, uses AI to engage users at times of high risk for addictive behavior. It’s a tool to help humans live better lives in an age of AI.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:06.397205+00:00"}

In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), META is trading at 9.23X, a premium compared with the broader sector’s 6.62X.\n\nShares of Alphabet and Amazon have increased 3.6% and 1.3%, respectively, on a YTD basis. However, Snap shares dropped 27.8%. The broader sector appreciated 10.9% over the same timeframe.\n\nMETA’s shares have appreciated 31.8% year to date (YTD), outperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector, as well as its advertising peers, including Alphabet , Amazon and Snap .

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Snap SNAP.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMETA’s new AI-powered recommendation model for ads drove roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. A meaningful percentage of ad revenues came from campaigns that used one of its Generative AI (Gen AI) features. Smaller advertisers with limited budgets are expected to benefit from these Gen AI features. Enhanced capabilities of Andromeda that powers the ads retrieval stage of META’s ads system have driven nearly 4% higher conversions on Facebook mobile Feed and Reels.\n\nAI push is helping Meta Platforms’ offer content that is interesting and useful, eventually driving engagement. Improvement in content quality driven by META’s recommendation system has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram in the recently concluded second-quarter 2025. The launch of AI video editing tools across Meta AI and the new Edits app are noteworthy developments.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, video engagement improved with Instagram video time jumping more than 20% year-over-year globally. Video time spent on Facebook surged more than 20% year over year. Meta Platforms’ focus on further increasing the freshness of original posts is expected to drive user engagement.\n\nHere’s Why You Should Hold META Stock Right Now\n\nMeta Platforms is spending heavily on expanding AI infrastructure. For 2025, capital expenditure is expected to be between $66 billion and $72 billion (up from $64-$72 billion), driven by META’s Gen AI initiatives and core business.\n\nOperating expenses are expected in the $114-$118 billion range, with headcount expected to increase within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, Gen AI, regulations and compliance. Regulatory concerns in the United States and Europe, along with tariffs and premium valuation, make the stock a risky bet.\n\nAlthough these investments bode well for the company’s longer-term prospects, we believe sluggish monetization of platforms, such as Threads and Meta AI, is a concern. WhatsApp ads in Status are likely to earn a lower average price than Facebook or Instagram ads for the foreseeable future. Meta Platforms does not expect ads in Status to be a meaningful contributor to total impressions or revenue growth for the next few years. Ad revenues are expected to suffer from uncertainty related to higher tariffs and challenging macroeconomic conditions.\n\nMETA currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies that investors should wait for a more favorable point to accumulate the stock.

CEG, Vistra VST and Meta Platforms META.\n\nNuclear Stocks CEG and VST Power the AI Race\n\nConstellation Energy Corp. and Vistra, two of the most exciting names in the utilities sector, reported solid second-quarter earnings this morning. Both companies are emerging as key beneficiaries of the AI-driven surge in electricity demand, thanks in large part to their leadership in nuclear power. Constellation operates the largest nuclear fleet in the US with 21 reactors producing 19,400 MW, while Vistra ranks second with six reactors generating 6,400 MW.\n\nEach stock has demonstrated strong price momentum and sits just below all-time highs, reflecting investor conviction in the long-term AI power theme.\n\nConstellation Energy: Shares Consolidate After Earnings Beat\n\nConstellation reported adjusted EPS of $1.91, beating the $1.84 consensus estimate, while GAAP EPS came in at $2.67. Revenue hit $6.10 billion, surpassing expectations, and the company reaffirmed full-year guidance of $8.90 to $9.60 per share.\n\nThe quarter was boosted by strong performance in its zero-carbon nuclear fleet, favorable clean energy credits, and rising demand from corporate buyers. Notably, Constellation secured a 20-year power agreement with Meta Platforms, reinforcing its status as a top utility provider to large tech companies and AI-intensive infrastructure.\n\nWith the acquisition of Calpine on track and clean energy policy trends supportive, Constellation continues to deliver on both growth and earnings visibility.\n\nVistra: Profit Dips, But Stock Price Momentum Picks Up\n\nVistra’s adjusted EBITDA came in at $1.35 billion, slightly below last year’s $1.41 billion, while revenue rose about 10% year-over-year to $4.25 billion, though it came in light versus consensus. GAAP net income declined due to higher interest and operating costs, but the company reaffirmed full-year guidance and raised its 2026 EBITDA outlook above $6.8 billion.\n\nA notable development this quarter was Vistra’s announcement that it executed a definitive agreement to acquire seven natural gas facilities totaling ~2,600 MW of capacity from Lotus Infrastructure Partners. This acquisition will further diversify Vistra’s natural gas fleet geographically and play a critical role in meeting the rising electricity demand from AI data centers and hyperscale infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to its nuclear footprint, Vistra’s growing natural gas portfolio positions it as a reliable, dispatchable power provider in a market that increasingly needs stability to support 24/7 AI workloads.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:10.466280+00:00"}
{"id": "6fc37992-adc3-35bb-a4ae-180763f0a482", "ticker": "META", "title": "Battle of Dividend Stocks: Microsoft vs. Meta Platforms", "summary": "Microsoft continues to lead big tech in dividend payouts, but Meta Platforms has quietly launched a promising dividend with significant room to grow.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/08/battle-of-dividend-stocks-microsoft-vs-meta-platfo/", "published_at": "2025-08-08T07:30:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Microsoft continues to lead big tech in dividend payouts, but Meta Platforms has quietly launched a promising dividend with significant room to grow.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT 1.44%) has long been a go‑to for income among tech stocks, while Meta Platforms (META 3.16%) only began paying dividends last year. But Microsoft's long and impressive dividend track record doesn't automatically make it the better dividend stock when comparing the two.\n\nOn the surface, software giant Microsoft's dividend yield of about 0.6% comfortably exceeds social media specialist Meta's yield of roughly 0.3%. But beneath this headline dividend metric, the comparison isn't so straightforward. Ultimately, though, one of the two stocks does come out ahead when comparing them as dividend stocks. So, which is it?\n\nMicrosoft: a reliable dividend growth stock\n\nHighlighting Microsoft's track record of dividend growth, its quarterly payout of $0.83 per share, or $3.32 annually, represents a 10% boost over its dividend last year. Furthermore, the dividend marks the company's 20th consecutive year of increases.\n\nDespite Microsoft's modest dividend yield of just 0.6%, the company's payout is backed by one of the most durable business models in tech. In addition, the dividend is easy for the company to pay out. It taps into only 24% of the company's annual earnings and a third of its annual free cash flow.\n\nLooking ahead, Microsoft should be able to not only sustain but also grow this payout. Recent business performance shows a healthy, fast-growing company. In fiscal 2025, which ended June 30, Microsoft generated $281.7 billion in revenue, up 15% year over year. Operating income rose 17% to $128.5 billion. On the heels of such strong performance, the software company returned over $37 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.\n\nMeta: early days with upside potential\n\nMeta Platforms' dividend is still new to Wall Street. Introduced last year, the company, which is the parent of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, has already increased the payout once. In February, the company said it would boost its dividend by 5% to 52 and a half cents per share, translating to $2.10 annually.\n\nAlthough the company's dividend yield of 0.3% and recent dividend increase are small, investors shouldn't count Meta out as a dividend stock. After all, its dividend consumes only about 7% of earnings and roughly 10% of free cash flow -- extremely conservative metrics. Further, the company's recent business momentum is extraordinary. Meta's second-quarter revenue soared 22% year over year, and its earnings per share jumped 38%. This business strength was helped by 6% year-over-year growth in daily active users across its family of social media apps, an 11% year-over-year increase in ad impressions, and a 9% jump in price per ad.\n\nAs with Microsoft, Meta is returning cash in more ways than one. Indeed, this explains why it has been so modest with its dividend; management favors share repurchases by a wide margin. In its most recent quarter, management repurchased nearly $10 billion worth of its stock while paying out just $1.33 billion in dividends.\n\nAll that said, Meta's entire business model is comparatively new and potentially riskier. The company's reality labs segment continues to burn cash as Meta invests heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). Highlighting how Meta's business is showing signs of potentially becoming more capital-intensive over time, the company's capital expenditures this year are expected to be between $66 and $72 billion. This means capital expenditures will rise about 77% year over year.\n\nOf course, there's massive upside potential to the dividend, and the company's share repurchase program, if Meta's aggressive investments today help the company keep growing rapidly for years to come.\n\nThere's a clear winner\n\nSo, which tech giant is the better dividend stock? Microsoft is arguably the clear winner today. But that could change in the future.\n\n\n\nMaking the case for Microsoft, its yield is higher, its dividend is more established, and a long track record of consistent growth and strong free cash flow generation supports the payout. Investors can count on Microsoft to keep raising its dividend year after year, even as it continues to invest heavily in AI and cloud computing.\n\nMeta, on the other hand, is still a newcomer. Its dividend may grow substantially over time, but there's no proven history yet. And while management's capital allocation has been increasingly shareholder-friendly, the company's rapidly rising capital expenditures and still-nascent dividend policy make it a riskier choice for income-focused investors. Sure, the stock trades at a more conservative valuation of 28 times earnings, compared with Microsoft at about 39 times earnings. But this lower valuation makes sense given Meta's dependence on advertising, a much more volatile and unpredictable source of revenue than Microsoft's diversified business.\n\nLong term, Meta could very well become the better dividend stock of the two. But the safer bet today is Microsoft. For investors seeking dividend dependability with upside, the software giant is the more compelling choice.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:11.817492+00:00"}

Discover SCENE\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, OpenAI unveiled the next generation of its flagship AI model, GPT‑5. The new model, which creates a simpler interface to the world’s most popular AI platform, arrives amid mounting pressure from rivals like Meta, Anthropic, and Google.\n\n\"GPT is a significant upgrade over GPT-4 and a significant step along the path to AGI,\" CEO Sam Altman said, noting that among other things, GPT-5 can \"write a software program from scratch. We think this idea of software on demand will be a defining characteristic of the GPT-5 era.\" The new model wrote over 400 lines of code in two minutes, in a \"zero shot\" example from a prompt asking it to do a simulation of the Bernoulli effect.\n\nOne unexpected disappointment: though the new model has a 400K token context window, which is about four times more than GPT-4, it still pales in comparison against Claude or Gemini, which can handle over 1 million tokens of context. This is significant because token-context-window size determines how much information a language model can “remember” and work with in a single interaction—things like documents, codebases, long conversations, or research papers.\n\nClaude 3 and Gemini 1.5 already support over 1 million tokens, making OpenAI’s new model feel like it’s catching up, not leapfrogging. Claude can take in an entire book series, dense research archives, or huge code repositories and still give coherent, context-aware responses.\n\nGPT-5 did offer a raft of new features, including a video option in which it can watch you while you chat (or anything else via your camera). Likewise, next week, the company will begin allowing users to integrate their Gmail and Google Calendars.\n\nThe new model will be available to all GPT users, including the free tier, starting today. Free users will be usage capped; after hitting a limit, they will be automatically rolled over to a \"mini\" model, the company said.\n\nAltman positioned GPT-5 as a qualitative leap in AI capability during Thursday's livestream. \"GPT-4 is like talking to a college student. Now, GPT-5 is like talking to an expert,\" he said, while talking about the company's ambition to move beyond incremental improvements toward fundamentally different AI interactions. Here are some of its new features announced today.\n\nBusiness Integration Focus\n\nThe company emphasized enterprise applications throughout the presentation. \"It will be an especially important moment for businesses,\" Altman noted, highlighting GPT-5's enhanced reasoning capabilities as a potential transformer for corporate workflows and decision-making processes.Unified Reasoning Architecture.\n\nOpenAI described reasoning as central to its artificial general intelligence strategy. \"Reasoning is at the heart of our AGI program,\" the team explained. The breakthrough eliminates previous trade-offs between speed and analytical depth: \"Until now users had to pick between slow answers using reasoning and fast answers with normal token prediction. This model eliminates that barrier.\"\n\nEnhanced Performance Metrics\n\nThe company touted comprehensive improvements across key metrics. \"GPT-5 is faster, more reliable and more accurate\" than its predecessor, according to internal testing. OpenAI also positioned the model as \"the best coding model to date,\" with demonstrated software development capabilities that surpass previous iterations.The model also beats all the scores in different benchmarks shared by the company, especially in math and coding.\n\nEnhanced Safety and Reliability\n\nGPT-5 demonstrates significant improvements in truthfulness and accuracy compared to previous models. \"We found GPT-5 is significantly less deceptive than o3,\" OpenAI reported during the presentation. The reduced hallucination rate addresses one of the most persistent challenges in large language model deployment, particularly for enterprise applications requiring factual precision.\n\nSynthetic Data Breakthrough\n\nOpenAI revealed a new training approach centered on synthetic data generation. \"We are experimenting with a new set of techniques,\" the team explained, describing their methodology shift. \"Our breakthrough was not to create more data but to create the right set of data,\" the company noted, indicating that the synthetic data used for pretraining delivers substantially better results than traditional data collection methods.\n\nPersonalized Memory System\n\nThis is more a ChatGPT feature than a model improvement, but it could heavily impact the way people use ChatGPT. The new model features enhanced memory capabilities that allow users to customize their chatbot's behavior patterns. ChatGPT can now be tailored to specific goals or objectives, making interactions more helpful and aligned with individual user needs. This personalization extends beyond simple preference settings to include behavioral modifications that persist across conversations.\n\nAgentic Coding Excellence\n\nGPT-5 delivers exceptional performance in autonomous coding tasks, handling live implementation and iterative development with natural ease. \"GPT-5 sets a whole new standard. It's the best model at agentic coding tasks,\" the team announced, with co-founder Greg Brockman emphasizing \"It's incredible at front end... It's extremely good at instruction following.\"\n\nThe model eliminates the need to switch between specialized coding assistants, allowing users to rely on GPT-5 for all development phases from planning through debugging. OpenAI presented three variants—GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, and GPT-5 nano—all capable of handling tools, functions, and different programming formats seamlessly. It has also been trained to build apps that are more visually appealing and hhave better frontend understanding\n\nGPT-5 introduces tool call explanations, allowing the model to describe its intended actions before executing them, making task execution more efficient and transparent for developers. Users can adjust verbosity settings to control output length and manage token costs while maintaining functionality. The model achieved top performance on SWE-bench, establishing GPT-5 as the most powerful model for software engineering tasks currently available.\n\nAccess Structure\n\nOpenAI announced a tiered rollout strategy for the new model. Free tier users will start with GPT-5 before transitioning to a lighter \"GPT-5 mini\" version when they deplete their usage quota, while Pro subscribers receive unlimited access to the full model. The company confirmed that all existing ChatGPT features will remain compatible with the new system.\n\nThe company is deprecating its older models, and asked GPT-5 to write an obituary for them, which one of the presenters pointed out was more natural in its reponse, like talking to someone with a higher IQ and higher EQ she said: “It has more rhythm … It’s actually quite personal—and that’s the kind of thing GPT-5 does better... the responses feel less like AI.\" The model also has native multilingual capabilities, making it more capable than other models in multilingual tasks\n\nAn 800-Pound Gorilla in the AI Space\n\nChatGPT currently boasts 700 million weekly active users, compared to Google Gemini’s 47 million weekly users. Despite its large user base, GPT-5 will be competing with Meta AI, whose own weekly user base stands at 700 million, thanks to its integration with Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nTo date, OpenAI has raised $57 billion across 11 funding rounds, according to data from Tracxn, and is valued at $300 billion. According to a Reuters report, that valuation number is expected to rise to $500 billion if a proposed stock sale option goes through. The company doubled its revenue in the first seven months of the year and is expected to reach $20 billion by December 31, Reuters reported.\n\nAltman first publicly confirmed that OpenAI started working on GPT‑5 in 2023, with the actual training phase beginning one year later. On February 13, 2025, Altman outlined the company’s roadmap and said GPT‑5 was expected to launch “within months,” with the aim of unifying OpenAI’s O‑Series and GPT models.\n\nour livestream tomorrow at 10 am PDT will be longer than usual, around an hour. we have a lot to show and hope you can find the the time to watch! — Sam Altman (@sama) August 7, 2025\n\nAltman has recently spent a great deal of time opining about artificial general intelligence, fueling speculation that OpenAI could use today’s event to announce a breakthrough. Earlier this month, however, he cautioned that there could be additional delays in the rollout of GPT, asking users to \"please bear with us.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the launch earlier this week, OpenAI released two open-weight models on Tuesday—gpt‑oss‑120b and gpt‑oss‑20b—under an open license, aimed at developers seeking to run models locally.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:23.409886+00:00"}

The world's biggest AI developers - Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft, which backs OpenAI - have dramatically increased capital expenditures to pay for AI data centers, nourishing investor hopes for great returns. These four companies expect to spend nearly $400 billion this fiscal year in total.\n\nOpenAI is now in early discussions to allow employees to cash out at a $500 billion valuation, a huge step-up from its current $300 billion valuation.

On Thursday, OpenAI took a major step in its effort to reassert its leadership with the launch of GPT-5, the long-awaited update to its flagship AI product and its most powerful and fastest model yet.\n\nThe company said the model delivers “more accurate answers than any previous reasoning model,” and is “much smarter across the board,” reflected by strong performance on academic and human-evaluated benchmarks. Its research blog noted new state-of-the-art performance across math, coding, and health questions, and found that GPT-5 outperformed other OpenAI models across tasks spanning over 40 occupations including law, logistics, sales, and engineering. In addition, it is being billed as “one unified system” that provides “the best answer, every time,” with no need to choose from what was becoming a laundry list of different OpenAI models.\n\n“GPT-5 really feels like talking to a PhD-level expert in any topic,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told journalists in a pre-briefing on Wednesday. “Something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable in any other time in history.”\n\nAltman described GPT-5 as a “significant step” along the path to artificial general intelligence (AGI), which according to OpenAI’s mission statement is defined as “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.”\n\nOpenAI is making its latest AI model free to all ChatGPT users—the first time free users will have access to one of its reasoning models—as well as through an API that lets developers and businesses build on top of it. OpenAI is also rolling out some new ChatGPT features: Users can choose from four preset personalities—Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd—to customize how the AI responds, while Pro users will soon be able to connect Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts, allowing ChatGPT to reference that information automatically during chats. Voice mode is also getting an upgrade, with more adaptive and expressive responses.\n\nIt’s unclear whether this combination of speed, power, and features will be enough, however. Some two years in the making (GPT-4 was launched in March 2023), GPT-5’s launch has taken longer than many industry insiders expected, as OpenAI has adjusted its approach in response to industry changes. And while ChatGPT now boasts an impressive 700 million weekly users, OpenAI has faced growing pressure over the past year as rivals poach its talent and race ahead on emerging AI techniques like long-context reasoning and autonomous tool use. In addition to Big Tech competitors like Meta and Google, OpenAI must contend with a wave of startups founded by its own former researchers, including Anthropic, Thinking Machines, and Safe Superintelligence. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has emerged as a particularly aggressive rival, forming a new superintelligence team that has lured away several top OpenAI scientists. And in January, Chinese upstart DeepSeek briefly knocked OpenAI back on its heels—part of a growing flood of powerful Chinese models now vying for global influence.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:29.321258+00:00"}

And that looks set to continue, with the company facing more fines in Italy, among various other pending investigations.\n\nWhich is a big reason why Meta has chosen to align with Trump, and implement measures like Community Notes, while scrapping third-party fact-checking, in line with Trump Administration requests.\n\nMeta also appointed Republican Joel Kaplan as its head of global affairs back in January, another move designed to better ingratiate the company with the Trump team, in the hopes that the Trump White House will help it clear more regulatory hurdles, and maximize progress, on various fronts.\n\nWhich also means maximizing revenue, and with EU penalties taking away such a big chunk of cash, Meta’s big hope is that Trump himself will step in at some stage and take a stronger stand against increased regulation.\n\nAnd there have already been indications that Trump may do just that.\n\nTrump recently threatened to halt all trade discussions with Canadian officials over the implementation of Canada’s “Digital Services Tax,” which also takes aim at Meta. That forced Canada to shelve the plan, while government officials have also publicly criticized the DSA, as well as EU regulations relating to AI innovation. Earlier in the year, Trump also threatened European imports with tariffs, in penalty for tech regulations that harm U.S. companies.\n\nIt seems that now, the U.S. government is moving to take a stronger stance on this front. And while the main impetus of the communication is the protection of free speech, it does seem like it could become a bigger battle, which could force EU regulators back down on at least some of their provisions.\n\nWould that lead to a better outcome for users?\n\nI mean, it’s hard to say. Some of the EU regulations seem to have only penalized the platforms themselves, with limited harm to users, while other protections ensure greater control, which could have a broader impact.\n\nBut overall, the concern is that regulatory groups are using more and more measures to penalize Meta for its success, and feed some of the money that it takes in via its dominant ads business back into local markets.\n\nArguments can be made for both sides, but either way, it does seem like the stage is being set for a larger political showdown over EU rules.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:32.433070+00:00"}

AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.48 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, which is now available in more than 200 countries and territories. The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement.\n\n\n\nMETA’s new AI-powered recommendation model for ads drove roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. A meaningful percentage of ad revenues came from campaigns that used one of its Generative AI (Gen AI) features. Smaller advertisers with limited budgets are expected to benefit from these Gen AI features. Enhanced capabilities of Andromeda that powers the ads retrieval stage of META’s ads system have driven nearly 4% higher conversions on Facebook mobile Feed and Reels.\n\n\n\nAI push is helping Meta Platforms’ offer content that is interesting and useful, eventually driving engagement. Improvement in content quality driven by META’s recommendation system has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram in the recently concluded second-quarter 2025. The launch of AI video editing tools across Meta AI and the new Edits app are noteworthy developments.\n\n\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, video engagement improved with Instagram video time jumping more than 20% year-over-year globally. Video time spent on Facebook surged more than 20% year over year. Meta Platforms’ focus on further increasing the freshness of original posts is expected to drive user engagement.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:36.026148+00:00"}

That will help them avoid heavy losses in a game in which the winners take all and the playing field is tilted heavily toward those with the biggest budgets.\n\nAccording to data from Bloomberg, four of the world’s largest tech firms – Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta – are expected to funnel more than $344 billion into capital expenditures this year, much of which will go toward data centers that feed their lofty AI ambitions.\n\nThey aren’t alone:\n\nAccording to data from Pitchbook, reported by CNBC in late July, AI startups raised more than $104 billion in the first half of 2025, nearly matching the total amount invested in AI startups in 2024. Around two-thirds of all venture funding during that period went to AI.\n\nAnd investors are devising their own AI infrastructure strategies, too. On Wednesday, Apollo Global Management agreed to acquire a majority stake in Stream Data Centers, and Brookfield Asset Management announced a strategy dedicated to developing AI infrastructure, aiming to capitalize on a “significant pipeline of opportunities.”\n\nThe firms are all vying for a piece of a market that’s estimated to be worth multiple trillions, said Brian Sathianathan, CTO and co-founder of Iterate.ai. Some are already starting to see the payoff. Industry darling Nvidia has been able to “sell and move servers with all the data center buildouts,” he said, and the three biggest cloud providers – Google, Amazon and Microsoft – are seeing significant growth. “It’s already working,” he said.\n\nThose that manage to win have a shot at massive returns. “This market’s got the potential to do that,” Sathianathan said. But with all the cash flowing into developments, some companies may be digging themselves into a hole that they’re not able to get out of, he said.\n\n“This is a winner takes all,” said Sathianathan. “If 20 players are vying for a spot that five can fill, then 15 are going to fail. That’s just the nature of free markets.”\n\nSo where does this leave the average enterprise? The best place to start is determining what “core competencies” your business has and how AI fits into them, Sathianathan said.\n\nWhen choosing an AI vendor, he added, it’s best not to put all your eggs in one basket. “I would warn enterprises from fully betting on one Big Tech firm,” he said. Doing so could create a “lock-in” that ends up making it more difficult to switch if better options present themselves. “Bet on a few, and also bet on startups,” he recommended.\n\n“Big companies have invested so much in this,” Sathianathan said. “They’re going to try and put you into a place where you are stuck with their software or their infrastructure.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:38.448430+00:00"}

As a tech company, Tesla is heavily invested in artificial intelligence and robotics, but Ritchie has a warning for investors. “It is still too soon to bet on it at this valuation,” he said, “especially since most of Tesla’s developments are focused on autonomous driving, which still faces a lot of challenges including regulatory ones that could delay it for at least a couple of years.”\n\nCompared to other tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon, Tesla still has a higher P/E ratio, but this may be more due to its leadership as a car company.\n\nAs a car manufacturer, Tesla’s market cap of nearly $1 trillion dwarfs that of legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors. However, recent performance has raised concerns. In Q2 2025, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries dropped 13.5%, falling to 384,122 units compared to 443,956 in the same period last year. This decline has impacted earnings and shaken investor confidence in some markets.\n\nAdditionally, according to David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX, an automated trading platform, “[Tesla hasn’t] yet proved that they can dominate the EV market.

Um, although private markets are, uh, just as unsustainable as, um, uh, public markets are for a while, just, you know, the crazy ideas, they they get bought. My cautionary moment here for AI, and let me tell you, I am a huge believer in AI. I was a software engineer in the 90s. I worked at AI companies including, you know, neural networking, tool development, the whole thing. I believe in it's ability to add productivity, but currently the companies like OpenAI that say, hey, we're smart, just trust us and we're going to do this, um, AGI thing. You know, we we don't know what it is, but here, give us money. I think that's all well and good, but the thing that I learned from my days in tech is identify the problem that a technology solves, what the cost of that is to deliver and versus the problem that it's solving, the cost of the problem. And the the delivery, you know, the cost of the solution has to be less than the cost of the problem. And that $500 billion dollars to me just smacks of, you know, trust us. We're going to build it and the problem will come, and I don't believe it. I would not it's hard to say, but you know, this could be a moment where we're just throwing money and hoping for the best, and that's not a great strategy for investing.\n\n05:30 Speaker A\n\nSo Kim, just quickly then, what does the sort of worst-case scenario look like? Or even not worst-case, what does the sort of meh scenario look like?\n\n05:44 Kim Forrest\n\nWell, the meh scenario has played out over and over again with 3D printing with the latest has been autonomous driving. What investors biggest issue is with investing in a new technology is not giving it enough time to be developed and mature for the real world. Like in 2015, 2016, everybody was saying driving cars are around the, you know, just around the corner. Well, 10 years later, we're finally getting to it, and it's not a pervasive rollout. It's a good rollout, right? And there's some other areas that not just robo taxis, but I think long haul trucking is going to be a thing, but again, this has taken 10 years to be right around the corner. And I think that is what could happen. Investors could weary of all this money being spent and returns not being seen. And that could then make all of this kind of the valuations crash, not necessarily the companies or the idea. It could slow the build out for sure if investors won't, you know, throw more money at it. But new technology, look backwards and see what happens, and it often happens this way where there's a flush at the beginning, a rush to get out, and ultimately, you know, it does deliver, but in different ways than we had anticipated originally.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:52.948581+00:00"}

Meta also delivered some shocking news that helped propel the stock higher, as its expected growth is far greater than anyone predicted.\n\nBut after a large jump in a short time frame, is the stock still worth buying?\n\nQ2's growth far exceeded management's expectations\n\nMeta Platforms is better known for the social media platforms that it owns: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The key part of these apps is the advertising revenue that they generate. In Q2, advertising generated $46.6 billion in revenue for Meta. Companywide, Meta generated $47.5 billion.\n\nThat's nearly all of Meta's revenue, so it's clear that as long as advertising remains strong, Meta will remain strong. In Q2, ad revenue rose 22% year over year. Because the revenue makes up a large chunk of Meta's total, this 22% growth rate is equal to its overall growth rate. The big kicker here is that Meta was only expecting 13% revenue growth at the midpoint for Q2.\n\nQ2 clearly exceeded all expectations for growth, which is one of the reasons why the stock responded so positively; the other reason was the outlook.\n\nMeta expects to sustain this growth through at least the next quarter\n\nLooking ahead to Q3, Wall Street analysts expected Meta to forecast $46.2 billion in revenue. However, management completely blew that expectation away, guiding for revenue between $47.5 billion and $50 billion. That indicates 20% growth at the midpoint, which shows that this rapid growth is expected to persist.\n\nThat's an incredible outlook for Meta and shows that the company isn't just succeeding, it's knocking it out of the park. However, the 11% jump following Q2 earnings may concern investors that all of this success has been pulled forward. So, is Meta a solid buy now?\n\nMeta's stock isn't the cheapest around\n\nAfter the one-day jump, Meta trades at 28 times earnings.\n\nBesides the decline Meta experienced alongside the broader market in April, this is pretty much in line with where the stock has traded at since 2024. As a result, investors shouldn't be overly concerned with the price that they're paying. Furthermore, the S&P 500 index (^GSPC 1.13%) trades at 24.9 times trailing earnings, which isn't that much cheaper than Meta (although still historically expensive).\n\nWith Meta's impressive growth rate and dominant business model, I'm confident that Meta can still deliver market-beating growth moving forward. The Wall Street analyst community was bearish on Meta's stock heading into earnings, as its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was identical to its trailing P/E ratio, indicating no earnings growth over the next year.\n\nHowever, Meta delivered 38% diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth in Q2, so this argument has been completely upended. This could cause a wave of analyst upgrades coming in the next few weeks, which could drive Meta's stock even higher.\n\nThe price for Meta's stock is fair, and with excellent growth ahead of it, I still think it's a top stock to buy in the market today.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:54.780815+00:00"}

It's now the largest company in the entire world thanks to its market capitalization of $4.3 trillion, but I think its stock still has room for upside.\n\nNvidia supplies the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which have become the gold standard for AI development. Tech giants like Alphabet and Meta Platforms recently told shareholders they plan to spend more on AI data center infrastructure this year than originally anticipated, and they are among the chipmaker's largest customers.\n\nNvidia is scheduled to release its financial results for its fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended July 30) on Aug. 27. Here's why I think the report could be a catalyst for more upside in its stock.\n\nAI infrastructure spending continues to climb\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU was the hottest data center chip for AI training and AI inference workloads in 2023, when large language models (LLMs) started going mainstream. Those LLMs were great at delivering one-shot responses, which created a fast and convenient way for users to find information, but they were sometimes inaccurate.\n\nThe latest generation of AI models focuses on \"reasoning,\" which means they spend more time operating in the background to weed out errors before rendering responses. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, these models consume up to 1,000 times more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) than the old one-shot LLMs, so they require substantially more computing capacity.\n\nNvidia developed the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPU architectures to deliver that capacity. Blackwell Ultra GPUs like the GB300 offer up to 50 times more performance than the H100 in certain configurations, and these chips were forecast to start shipping in the second half of calendar year 2025. Since Nvidia's fiscal Q2 2026 included July, investors should expect a sales update in the company's upcoming earnings report on Aug. 27.\n\nAll signs point to astronomical demand, because many of Nvidia's largest customers continue to ramp up their data center infrastructure spending. Alphabet, for instance, just raised its 2025 capital expenditures (capex) forecast from $75 billion to $85 billion. Meta Platforms also increased the low end of its capex guidance from $64 billion to $66 billion, but the company says it could spend up to $72 billion.\n\nAmazon, on the other hand, allocated $55.7 billion to capex during the first two quarters of 2025, and its guidance suggests that its full-year spending could top a whopping $118 billion. Most of that will go toward AI data center infrastructure and chips.\n\nNvidia's upcoming report could be another blockbuster\n\nNvidia's guidance suggests that its total revenue came in at around $45 billion in Q2 of fiscal 2026, which would be a 50% increase from the year-ago period. If previous quarters are any indication, the data center segment likely represented around 90% of total revenue, led by GPU sales.\n\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests that the company also delivered earnings of around $1 per share during the quarter, which would be a 47% jump year over year. This number can influence Nvidia's valuation, and hence the direction of its stock, so it's an important one for investors to watch.\n\nWall Street will also focus on management's forecast for the upcoming fiscal 2026 third quarter, because it's likely to reflect demand for the new Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Analysts will be looking for revenue guidance of around $52 billion, so any number above that could be very bullish for Nvidia stock.\n\nNvidia stock could soar after Aug. 27\n\nNvidia reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 on May 28, and its stock is up 33% since then. I think the Q2 report on Aug. 27 will be another upside catalyst, as long as the company's results don't fall short of expectations.\n\nNvidia stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 60.1 as of this writing. That's right in line with its 10-year average, suggesting it's at fair value. However, the picture looks very different if we value the stock based on the company's future potential earnings.\n\nWall Street predicts that Nvidia will deliver earnings of $4.30 per share during fiscal 2026 overall, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 43. In other words, the stock would have to climb by 40% over the next six months just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 60.1.\n\nSince so many of Nvidia's top customers have increased their capex forecasts for this year, I think the company will easily meet expectations on Aug. 27, and potentially even exceed them. Either of those scenarios will lay the groundwork for more upside in its stock from here.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:06:56.155454+00:00"}

Wednesday’s announcement will bring Apple’s cumulative commitment to $600 billion.\n\n“President Trump’s America First economic agenda has secured trillions of dollars in investments that support American jobs and bolster American businesses,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement. “Today’s announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America’s economic and national security.”\n\nThe move is part of a push toward assembling additional critical components domestically, according to a White House official who detailed the announcement on the condition of anonymity. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is expected to attend the White House event.\n\nCorning will dedicate an entire factory in Kentucky to Apple glass production, increasing that company’s workforce in the state by 50%, the iPhone maker said. Corning was already a supplier to Apple, making glass for the very first iPhone at the same factory.\n\nAs part of what it calls the American Manufacturing Program, or AMP, Apple promised to bring more of its supply chain and advanced production to the US. The company’s AMP partners include glassmaker Corning Inc., Applied Materials Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and others, the company said.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. committed to spending another $100 billion on domestic manufacturing ahead of an event with President Donald Trump, marking the latest pledge by the tech giant to increase US production as it seeks to avoid punishing tariffs on its flagship iPhones.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump signed an order Wednesday hiking tariffs on goods from India by an additional 25% over its purchases of Russian oil, on top of a 25% country-specific duty set to take effect Thursday.\n\nWhile Apple’s promised investment is substantial, it stops short of the full shift to US-based production that Trump and top White House officials have envisioned.\n\nEarlier this year, the president threatened to hit Apple with a tariff of at least 25% if it didn’t move manufacturing of the iPhone to the US, a day after meeting with Cook at the White House. Trump administration officials have suggested that Apple could assemble its phones and other electronics domestically using robotics.\n\nApple said last week that it took an $800 million hit from tariffs in the June quarter — slightly less than previously projected — and expected them to add $1.1 billion its costs in the September quarter, assuming no policy changes or new duties.\n\nDuring a call last week with analysts, Cook said “the vast majority” of iPhones sold in the US come from India, while the bulk of other products, such as MacBooks, iPads and Apple Watches, sold in the US are manufactured in Vietnam.\n\n“We obviously try to optimize our supply chain,” Cook said at the time. “And ultimately, we will do more in the United States.”\n\nBut onshoring manufacturing, particularly for the iPhone product line, would amount to a massive undertaking for Apple, whose facilities in China and India employ several hundred thousand people and involve heavily customized processes.\n\nInstead, Cook has led a push to win a tariff carve-out for the company’s most important products. Trump is readying plans to unveil levies on all products containing semiconductor chips as soon as next week. Separately, the president’s country-specific tariffs on dozens of trading partners are set to take effect on Thursday.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Apple was able to convince Trump to exempt its products from import taxes. If Cook is able to do so again, it could help the company avoid costs that analysts expected to erode profit margins and increase consumer prices — or even offer a competitive advantage over foreign rivals including Samsung Electronics Co.\n\nCook has sought to curry favor with Trump over a series of private meetings and dinners, and was among a small group of tech leaders — including Elon Musk, Alphabet Inc.’s Sundar Pichai, Meta Platforms Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos — who attended the president’s second inauguration at the US Capitol.\n\nStill, Apple’s initial $500 billion, 20,000-job pledge, first announced in February, represented just a slight acceleration over its prior investments and previously announced plans, adding $39 billion in spending and an additional 1,000 jobs annually.\n\nThe Apple event is the latest in a flurry of announcements Trump has made alongside corporate leaders who have said they plan to increase their US presence.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump announced a $100 billion investment in artificial intelligence data centers from Oracle Corp., SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI Inc. — with a goal of increasing the total to at least $500 billion — a bid to boost American innovation in technology and artificial technology. OpenAI and Oracle later announced they will develop 4.5 gigawatts of additional US data-center capacity in an expanded partnership.\n\nThe president has also ramped up partnerships with key players in the chip industry, announcing that Nvidia Corp., the dominant player in chips for AI models, plans to produce as much as half a trillion dollars’ worth of AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years through manufacturing partnerships.\n\nTrump has also made securing investments a key part of negotiating with other countries on geopolitical issues, such as trade.\n\nPart of the US’ deal with the European Union included an agreement from the EU to purchase $750 billion in American energy products and invest $600 billion in the US, while the president’s deal with Japan includes the creation of a $550 billion fund to make investments in the US.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:07:10.299008+00:00"}

Tea is advertised as a women’s safety app with more than 6 million users that is similar to “Are we dating the same guy?” Facebook networks. However, the app is controversial, since many of the claims that women post cannot be verified.\n\nThe backlash surrounding Tea escalated last week, after 404 Media reported 4chan users retaliated by discovering a publicly exposed database belonging to the app, which revealed over 72,000 images, including thousands of selfies and photo IDs submitted for account verification.

The report raises concern that the White House would use the division as a political tool.\n\nThe fired officials, Roger Alford and William Rinner, who served in Trump's first administration, had been working on the department's challenge to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) acquisition of rival Juniper Networks (JNP.SG), the report said — before a settlement was reached with HPE's politically connected lawyers, who lacked antitrust expertise.\n\nAlford was the principal deputy to President Trump's hand-picked antitrust chief, Gail Slater.

When consumers encounter marketing efforts that feel familiar and relevant, they’re more likely to take notice, driving not only feelings of value, recognition and exclusivity that foster loyalty but also boosting conversion rates and overall customer satisfaction.”\n\nIndeed, according to a 2024 study by Deloitte, 80% of U.S. consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences.\n\nIn addition to this, 78% of consumers want personalization that saves them money, while 73% of EU consumers responded positively to seeing an ad with useful information for a product/service they intended on buying.\n\nSo there are clear benefits, and the report highlights the how and why of establishing personalization within your marketing process, and how you can build trust with your audience through such measures.\n\nThe report also looks at the fundamentals of using personalization in a considered manner, which imbues trust with your customers.\n\nWhile there are also notes on how brands can enact a responsible, and responsive, personalization plan, which aligns with both concerns about data collection, and the capacity to intake user info.\n\nThe report essentially provides a framework for an effective personalization strategy, while also arguing the benefits of such, and why regulators should allow responsible brands to utilize this info.\n\nWhich, again, likely relates to Meta’s ongoing argument with EU authorities over their increasingly stringent data protection rules, and restrictions on Meta’s ad models around such.\n\nAnd the case is compelling, while there are also some valuable considerations for brands looking to ensure that they use customer data in a responsible way.\n\nYou can download the full “Path to Personalization” report here.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:07:19.515613+00:00"}

Discover SCENE\n\nMeta has removed more than 6.8 million WhatsApp accounts linked to “pig butchering” scam operations run by organized crime syndicates in Southeast Asia this year, part of a broader effort to clamp down on criminals trying to steal crypto from victims.\n\nTypically, pig butchering scams begin with an unsolicited message and escalate into conversations that shift onto encrypted messaging apps or private chats. The end goal is to convince victims to transfer money—often crypto—to fake businesses or \"investment\" platforms.\n\nVictims usually realize too late that their deposits can't be withdrawn.\n\n\"We proactively detected and took down accounts before scam centers were able to operationalize them,\" the company said in a press release.\n\n﻿\n\nMeta linked the account to scam networks operating out of countries like Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand, where law enforcement has reported that criminal groups carry out mass fraud campaigns targeting global victims.\n\nThe recent enforcement push is designed to disrupt these groups before they can begin victimizing users.\n\nWhatsApp is also rolling out new tools to help users spot and report suspicious activity. One such feature will alert users when they are added to a group by someone not in their contact list, a common tactic used by fraudsters promoting fake investment schemes.\n\nThe announcement comes amid growing calls for social media and messaging apps to take a more proactive approach to stopping scammers using these platforms to reach and exploit victims, often at scale.\n\nAccording to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), $9.3 billion was lost to online scams in 2024—marking a record high.\n\nCryptocurrency scams alone accounted for more than $3.9 billion of that total, with elderly users particularly hard hit. With that number only based on reports made to the FBI, the real total is likely significantly higher.\n\nGrowing Crypto Scam Problem\n\nMany of these scams began on messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or Telegram.\n\nMeta cited one recent case in which it collaborated with OpenAI to disrupt a Cambodian group running a rent-a-scooter pyramid scheme. The scammers reportedly used ChatGPT to craft instructions for victims and recruited people with fake offers of money in exchange for social media engagement.\n\nAuthorities globally have ramped up warnings in recent months, urging users to enable two-step verification on WhatsApp and to be suspicious of any odd messages or unexpected group invites.\n\nStill, critics argue that platforms like Meta need to take stronger, more systemic action.\n\nIn a blog last month, senior vice president fraud reduction at the Banking Policy Institute, Greg Williamson said that the incentives for social media giants to crack down on scammers are misaligned.\n\n\"To effectively combat scams, tech platforms must prioritize customer protection.

Under CEO Evan Spiegel, Snap has been fighting to regain traction in its ad business.\n\n“SNAP had a tough Q2,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson in a note to clients early Wednesday. “Most importantly, Q2's execution on ad platform development & surface expansion efforts did not go according to plan, which will continue to reinforce the bear case that SNAP cannot break out of being a smaller ad platform lacking the ability to durably grow its direct response business in-line with the market.”\n\nSnap stock is down nearly 29% in 2025, underperforming its peers. Meta and Reddit, for example, are up 31% and 26% for the year, respectively.\n\nStill, Snap’s outlook for the current quarter topped analysts’ expectations. The company expects third quarter revenue to fall between $1.48 billion and $1.51 billion, while analysts had estimated a midpoint of $1.48 billion. Snap projects third quarter adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of $117.5 million at the midpoint, more than the $116.1 million expected.\n\nSnap Inc. logo.

Motley Money starts now. I'm Rachel Warren, joined today by Motley Fool analysts Lou Whiteman and Jon Quast. Today, we're talking Mag 7 spending plans and tariff turmoil, but we have to start with the big macro picture first. We learned Wednesday that the US economy returned to growth in Q2. US gross domestic product, which is a measure of the value of goods and services produced across the economy, rose by 3% in the second quarter. That's up from a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter of the year, and it's actually ahead of the consensus estimate. We also saw that consumer spending rose by more than 1% in Q2. Now, this was as exports declined single digits, and imports fell by more than 30%, reversing a major surge that we saw in Q1 of 2025. Jon, the big takeaway for me is consumer spending seems to be holding up well even as businesses have turned cautious. But the question is, with all the headwinds the economy is facing, do you think that this can continue?\n\nJon Quast: Yes, this can absolutely continue. Rachel, consumer spending can hold up. Now, listen, I could give you so many reasons on why to be skeptical on why the opposite is true. First and foremost, there's 1.2 trillion in credit card debt out there right now. That's up 30% in just the last three years. It would seem that consumers are spending, yes, but it also seems like they're spending on credit. So that's a party that the music is going to end, eventually, it would seem, and when that music ends, there could be a contraction to consumer spending. That said, I do say it can hold up because there's almost always a reason to be skeptical, and yet consumer spending almost always holds up. We will probably see shifts in consumer spending, and I think that is playing out. You take, for example, a company such as Kellanova. This is the company that was spun out from Kellogg's. It makes Pringles, Pop-Tarts. It reported financial results this morning on July 31, and it saw a softening of demand, and that is playing out for a variety of snacking companies right now. That's kind of a pervasive trend. People trending away from snacks. That's interesting. On the other hand, you have a company such as Carvana. They're selling 41% more cars in the most recent quarter compared to a year ago. There is this incredible shift of consumer spending, and it doesn't always make sense, from snacks to cars. But yeah, overall, I think that consumer spending can hold up.\n\nLou Whiteman: Jon's right. You have to be crazy to bet against the American consumer. But you know what? I'm feeling a little crazy right now, Rachel. I'm more worried about the consumer right here than I'm business. I think businesses can snap back as the companies adjust to whatever the new normal is with tariffs. But heading into back-to-school and then the holiday season, I do think Main Street is going to feel the pushback of higher prices, maybe more so than tariffs have just been creeping in. My guess is, if GDP does continue to push higher in the second half, and I do think it'll push higher in the second half, I think it'll be a reverse at the second quarter with business, not the consumer doing the heavy lift.\n\nRachel Warren: A healthy job market with low unemployment rates and rising wages. That's a primary driver of sustained consumer spending, and wage gains have been outpacing inflation. Consumers, in some cases have more disposable income to spend. Rising asset values can contribute to that wealth effect. and that can also make consumers feel more confident to spend. We've seen this dynamic where lower and middle-income consumers might be more vulnerable to economic shifts, but those in the top third of the income distribution area are thriving and account for a significant portion of spending. Now, it's worth noting the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged at its meeting on Wednesday. Now we know the Federal Reserve is likely to lower interest rates in September. You've got some economists predicting a further cut in December, according to recent reports. While the Fed held rates steady at their July meeting, the decision was not unanimous. There were two dissenting votes advocating for a rate cut. With tariff policy seemingly changing by the minute, it's hard to know what to expect. More on tariffs and big tech in a minute. You are listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nWelcome back. We might not yet know the final tariff rates for various US trade partners, but we are beginning to see an impact from the aggressive moves. India has reportedly overtaken China to become the top source of smartphones sold in the US, and that's fueled by Apple's shift to assemble more phones in the country. Vietnam now ranks second, and China has fallen from first to year ago to third. Now, Lou, the White House wanted to move smartphone assembly out of China, but I don't think India was the destination it had in mind. Does Tim Cook have to worry about backlash from Washington, and what are your thoughts on the tariff Mayhem?\n\nLou Whiteman: I think Tim Cook probably believes he can outlast the tariff push, and I think he's probably right. Look, this was the inevitable outcome of raising tariffs on China. There was never much of a chance that large corporations were just going to overnight shift manufacturing to the US. They'd have to build an entire supply chain, manufacturing footprint. There's just so much complexity, and they'd have to do it largely from scratch. It's just not going to happen. It didn't make sense for companies like Apple to do that. It made sense for them to lean into other markets where they are established. If tariffs do shift manufacturing back to the US, it'll take time. For now, the message from Washington, with all of this chaos has been things shift so fast, there's no reason for corporations to make any real massive CapEx moves. The chaos this week that just reinforces it, I think. The best move if you're a CEO is to roll with it and not make too many big company-altering decisions. That's what Apple's doing in India, and I think that makes sense. It's what honestly, they should be doing.\n\nRachel Warren: We are now just hours away from the White House's August 1 deadline for countries to strike trade deals or face higher tariffs, and we've seen a flurry of activity, we appear to be in deals with Taiwan, Thailand, and Cambodia. The UK led the charge on trade agreements with the US. They struck one as early as May. Vietnam was the second to ink a deal with the Trump administration. President Trump announced a trade agreement on July 2nd that saw the tariff imposed on Vietnam slash from 46% to 20%. Japan was the second major Asian economy to come to an agreement with the US after China. They saw their tariff rate cut to 15%. They were also the first to see a lower preferential tariff rate for their key automobile sector. Now, the EU's agreement with the US was struck just days ago, and that was after lengthy negotiations. EU goods are now facing a 15% baseline tariff rate. South Korea is the latest country to reach an agreement as well on Thursday, with the terms being somewhat similar to the one Japan received. It's worth noting, though, the US has managed to make only about eight deals in 120 days. Some of our key trading partners remain without a deal so far. That includes Canada, Australia, and India. Jon, the situation is and will remain fluid. But as an investor, how closely are you watching all of this wheeling and dealing?\n\nJon Quast: I'm not watching it closely at all, and I'll give you two reasons why. First of all, when I buy a stock, I have an investment thesis, and so this thesis is basically my reasoning for why the stock I bought is going to outperform the market average, and in my thesis, I try to conservatively account for risk, such as geopolitical risk. Like what we're talking about right here. If something can be broken, if my thesis can be broken based on changes in economic policy, I'm generally not that interested. I'm looking for something that doesn't really matter what these big changes in economic policy will be. The underlying trends for my thesis are still intact. I'll give you an example. Mercado Libre in South America. I've lived in South America. I can attest to how much paper money is still used in those economies, but that is changing so fast. Those economies are digitizing extremely fast, and Mercado Libre is a financial technology company. It's also an e-commerce company. You start looking at the pervasive trend that the economy is going digital, that's not going to change, and so I really see Mercado Libre being a long-term winner, regardless of what changes happen in the economic policy. Another reason I'm not really watching this closely is because even if there is a trade deal in place, even when something comes down, it seems like, and I believe this is fair to say, things in Washington these days are far from settled, and so if we get news today, that might change tomorrow. I really don't see a ton of value of following it too closely. I really think about Investing Great Charlie Munger. He said, \"I figure that I want to swim as well as I can against the tides. I'm not trying to predict the tides\". And I think it's a good rule to live by.\n\nLou Whiteman: I think that's spot on. One of the advantages of being a long-term investor is, everything near-term is noise. I'm looking for companies that, whatever may come, can survive and thrive over the long term. I don't necessarily want to predict the weather. I just want to know that sometimes it's sunny, sometimes it rains, and I want companies that can do OK with both. I think that's exactly right, Jon.\n\nRachel Warren: I think that's right, guys. Up next, we have Microsoft and Meta Earnings and their aggressive AI spending plans. We'll be back with you in a minute. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nMicrosoft and Meta platforms were both out with earnings last night. Now, both companies posted double-digit growth that easily topped expectations, but the focus was on spending plans. Meta Platforms ' CFO, Susan Lee, said,\" We really believe that this is the time for us to make investments in AI,\" and that's really backing up the company's planned $85 billion in CapEx this year. Microsoft, for its part, said that they expect to spend 30 billion in the current quarter alone, which at an annualized rate would be even more than Meta or Alphabet is spending. Jon, the numbers here are almost mind-numbingly large. But the core businesses of these companies they are generating billions in cash, so they can afford the investment. Should investors be worried or excited about these spending plans?\n\nJon Quast: I believe that investors should be absolutely thrilled, ecstatic with these plans. You're right. These numbers are mind-numbing. In fact, they're so big, we really can't even wrap our heads around them, 85 billion. Look, there are 500 companies in the S&P 500. With 85 billion, Meta could purchase any one of about 75% of these companies. These are the biggest, most profitable companies in the US, and they can buy most of them with 85 billion. That's a lot of money, and we're just talking about Meta with that. You start adding in Microsoft, Alphabet, all the mega caps, they're going to collectively spend about 320 billion this year in CapEx compared to 230 billion last year. That's nearly a 40% jump from last year. I think if you're a shareholder of any of these companies, it's basically good news because they need to invest in their futures at scale, and so it's going to cost a lot of money. But these companies have also made many shareholder-friendly moves in recent years, such as share buybacks and dividends, and so I feel like there's a good balance here. I think beyond that, though, investors need to think, Where is that 320 billion going to go? That's a lot of cash. I think companies such as NVIDIA and AMD are going to see ongoing, strong demand for their chips. I think even industrial players, such as HVAC and Electrical company Comfort System USA, they've got a rising backlog right now as they're trying to meet all this demand for the facilities being built to support AI. I think there's a lot to be excited about when you see how much money is getting thrown around.\n\nRachel Warren: It's clear that Meta and Microsoft are increasing their investments in AI because they see it as a crucial driver for future growth and also to maintain their competitive advantage in various sectors. It's interesting because, of course, Meta's fallen a bit behind the competition here the last few years. But then you have its recent launch if it's Meta super-intelligence labs, their hiring spree that they've been on in a bid to catch up in the AI race. It's getting a lot of attention from investors. Lou, what are your thoughts on what we're seeing?\n\nLou Whiteman: To me, Microsoft has the most clear use case for AI outside of just refining its own business or internal work. Alphabet and Meta are mostly deploying AI for internal uses. Alphabet is hoping to use AI to reinvent search, but it's early days there. But Microsoft, thanks to 365, thanks to Office, all these massive businesses they have a clear lane to the corporate user to deploy AI. It may not be a sustainable advantage. There could be a way to catch up, but I think it's a real advantage right now over these just cloud players. I think we're going to see companies with those strong B2B connections, like Microsoft, like Salesforce, even Oracle. I think they're going to lead the way on deploying AI to the workforce, this next step that is really showing the payoff and all this investment.\n\nRachel Warren: Investors pushed Microsoft higher following earnings. The company joined in NVIDIA as the second member of the $4 trillion market cap club. Time for a bold prediction, guys. What will be the next company to break the $4 trillion market cap threshold, Jon? Tell us.\n\nJon Quast: Rachel, this might be a little bit of a surprise, but I think that Alphabet is the best position to make a run at a $4 trillion market cap. When you look at the valuations of the mega cap companies, for me, Alphabet is the one that makes the most sense. It does seem like it has a fair valuation right now. But when it comes to its financial position, competitive strengths, opportunities, it's as good as any of them, if not better than others. I think the only risk here is that it gets broken up. But honestly, any company making a run at four trillion has to be worried about being broken up at some point.\n\nLou Whiteman: I hate to go into Alphabet here because I think you're probably right, but I'll take the Dark Horse. Meta is currently sixth on the list. It isn't even quite two trillion yet, but look, that advertising business is a powerhouse, and I don't see another business like it elsewhere with less headwinds up ahead than I think Alphabet and some of the others. I'll take Meta, though I'll be honest, I don't think any of these guys get there in the near term, so it could be a long race.\n\nRachel Warren: It is certainly an exciting time to be a tech investor and to be investing in the world of AI.

Existing investors including Thrive Capital have approached OpenAI about buying some of the employee shares, the people said.\n\nIf the deal goes ahead, it would elevate OpenAI’s on-paper price tag by roughly two-thirds. Its previous valuation stood at $300 billion in a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank Group Corp. — making it one of the largest privately held companies in the world. Representatives for OpenAI and Thrive declined to comment.\n\nThe latest move follows news last week the startup had secured $8.3 billion from a syndicate of investors for a second tranche of that $40 billion financing, which was oversubscribed by about five times, according to one of the people briefed on the discussions. OpenAI managed to snag that funding ahead of schedule, the person said.\n\nMajor US startups often negotiate share sales for their employees as a way to reward and retain staff, and also attract external investors. The company run by Sam Altman is looking to leverage investor demand to provide employees with liquidity that reflects the company’s growth, according to one of the people familiar with the investment negotiations.\n\nIn recent months, OpenAI lost several members of its research staff to Meta Platforms Inc. as the latter firm aggressively recruited top talent from Apple Inc. and other competitors for its “superintelligence” AI team, offering pay packages in the nine-figure range. A secondary sale for OpenAI could serve as a way to incentivize staff to remain at the company who are being offered lavish compensation.\n\nOpenAI also faces mounting competitive pressure from rival AI startups. Anthropic, founded by former employees of OpenAI, is nearing a deal to raise as much as $5 billion in a new round of funding that would value it at $170 billion, Bloomberg News has reported. Elon Musk is also said to be seeking a valuation of as much as $200 billion for his startup, xAI.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:07:36.834348+00:00"}

GameStop announced its first bitcoin purchase in late May, securing 4,710 tokens worth around $537 million at current prices.\n\nAdjusted for a stock split in 2022, GameStop soared from around $1 in the summer of 2020 to a peak intraday price of $121 on January 28, 2021. It has traded within a much tighter range of around $20 to $35 over the past 12 months.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nIt followed a similar trajectory to bitcoin by rising sharply in the fourth quarter of 2024, slumping this spring, and rebounding through early June.\n\nHowever, GameStop then fell after disappointing first-quarter earnings and dilutive share sales, whereas bitcoin kept climbing to fresh highs in July.\n\nGross bet against GameStop by selling call options at the height of its meme-stock surge in January 2021. An options contract gives the buyer the right to purchase or sell a stock at an agreed price within a set period. Sellers wager these contracts will expire worthless, and they can simply keep the premium paid by the buyer.\n\nGross was $15 million in the red, losing sleep at one point as GameStop kept climbing, but he doubled down.

He reiterated a neutral sector perform call.\n\nSnap's second quarter revenue increased 9% year over year to $1.345 billion, below estimates of $1.35 billion. The company lost 16 cents per share, slightly more than the 15 cents per share loss forecast by Wall Street analysts, according to FactSet.\n\nSnap said in a letter to investors that an \"issue with its ad platform\" caused some advertisers to win campaign auctions at \"substantially reduced prices.\" The issue has been fixed but acted as a headwind for Q2 revenue, the company said.\n\nOn the stock market today, Snap stock is down 17% at 7.77 in premarket action. Shares are set to tumble even further below Snap's 200-day moving average.\n\nSnap Lagging Meta, Reddit\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney also stuck to a neutral in-line rating for Snap. He wrote that it is \"hard not to come out more cautious\" on Snap stock following the results.\n\n\"Against a backdrop of very resilient internet sector ad revenue results and what were thought to be de-risked estimates, this was a surprisingly soft print,\" Mahaney wrote to clients Tuesday.\n\nMahaney noted that Snap blamed its revenue miss on \"an execution issue with Snap's ad platform, the timing of Ramadan, and the effects of the de minimis changes.\"\n\nSnap's much-larger rival Meta Platforms posted 22% sales growth for the same period. Meta's Facebook and Instagram dominate the digital ad market within social media. But the much-smaller Reddit managed to post 78% sales growth for its digital advertising business.\n\nSnap, meanwhile, guided for sales growth of between 8% and 10% for the current quarter.\n\n\"While the midpoint of the guide beat a stale consensus by 1%, Snapchat appears to be lagging peers significantly given guidance shared recently last week,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote to clients Tuesday.\n\nReddit guided for roughly 55% growth last week and Meta said it is expecting more than 20% revenue growth for Q3.\n\nOne positive from the report was Snap's growing Snapchat+ subscription revenue, Shmulik noted. The $3.99-per-month premium service reached 16 million users.\n\nSnap Stock Down 13% This Year\n\nSnap shares were down 13% year-to-date as of Tuesday's close and appear set to tumble further. The stock is more than 80% below record highs reached late in 2021.\n\nComing into the report, Snap stock had an IBD Composite Rating of 52 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

Since then, its shares have surged as investors became more aware of how the company differentiates itself from other social media stocks, particularly industry giant Meta Platforms.\n\nWhen searching for stocks that can help them become millionaires, many investors look at recent IPO stocks, ideally ones whose growth story has just begun. Given its successes and its recent move to go public, let's examine whether Reddit holds enough growth potential to mint millionaires.\n\nUnderstanding Reddit\n\nReddit differentiates itself from other social media sites by acting as a \"community of communities.\" Its site now hosts over 100,000 communities. Those have made it a go-to destination for information -- so much so that 110 million daily active users visit its forums, a number that has risen by 21% over the last year.\n\nNot surprisingly, Reddit follows the lead of its social media counterparts by earning most of its revenue from digital advertising. Additional revenue comes from data licensing and premium subscriptions.\n\nThat model has helped the company grow to an enormous size. Thanks to the 540% gain over the stock's history, its market cap now stands at just over $39 billion.This could present challenges if you're an individual investor hoping to become a millionaire from this stock. If you bought $10,000 worth of shares at this level, the 100-fold gain needed to multiply your position to $1 million would take the market cap to $3.9 trillion.\n\nThat's more than double Meta's current market cap of $1.9 trillion. It's also worth noting that only two companies, Nvidia and Microsoft, now have market caps above $3.9 trillion. So you'd face a considerable challenge in meeting that $1 million goal.\n\nReddit's second-quarter results\n\nHowever, the company's financial results for the second quarter of 2025 show the potential for massive stock gains. In Q2, Reddit brought in $500 million in revenue, a 78% increase from year-ago levels. Advertising revenue growth of 84% during that period drove most of those gains, demonstrating its success as a social media stock. Also, gross margin improved 130 basis points to 90.8%, pointing to an improving financial condition.\n\nMoreover, costs and expenses grew by a comparatively modest 38%, allowing Reddit to turn profitable. In Q2, it reported a net income of $89 million, a vast improvement over the $10 million loss in the second quarter of 2024. Not surprisingly, shareholders can also expect growth to continue into Q3. Reddit forecasts Q3 revenue of between $535 million and $545 million. That would translate to a yearly increase of 55% at the midpoint.\n\nHowever, that guidance would also amount to a sequential slowdown, and it's unclear how investors will react given the stock's valuation. Reddit's recent profitability leaves it with a P/E ratio of 329 -- likely not applicable as a valuation measurement -- though the forward P/E ratio of 59 could attract new investors.\n\nStill, you might also consider the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25, now close to record highs for the stock. It's reasonable to expect this metric to exceed the S&P 500's average P/S of 3.2, but you may be less tolerant of the current multiple when earnings growth is slowing down. While that's unlikely to change Reddit's long-term growth prospects, it makes the stock's near-term trajectory less certain.\n\nWill Reddit stock help you become a millionaire?\n\nIn its current state, Reddit may help you become a millionaire, but it is unlikely to take you there without a sizable investment. Reddit leads the industry in terms of online forums, and its vast user base and rapid revenue growth should bode well for shareholders.\n\nNonetheless, its $39 billion market capitalization puts it deep into large-cap territory. Considering that 100-fold growth would take it to a size more than double that of the dominant social media stock, it's unlikely that an investment of $10,000 or less can grow to $1 million.\n\nUltimately, Reddit shows considerable potential to deliver market-beating returns over time. Still, you should be willing to make a substantial investment if you want to grow a Reddit stock position to $1 million and beyond.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:07:51.771402+00:00"}

Among those establishing themselves are Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) and Meta Platforms (META 3.16%).\n\nBut here's the great thing about these companies: They aren't just AI plays. Both tech giants have excellent underlying operations, strong long-term prospects, and solid moats that should allow them to perform well over the long run.\n\nHere's why Amazon and Meta Platforms are strong forever picks.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy is incredibly bullish on AI. He believes that generative AI may be the most significant technological revolution since the internet, and that this is the early stages of its adoption.\n\nAmazon is going all in. The company offers a suite of AI-related services through its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which remains one of its fastest-growing segments. In the second quarter, Amazon's net sales increased by 13% year over year to $167.7 billion. Sales from AWS totaled $30.9 billion, representing a 17.5% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nIt's having an even bigger impact on the bottom line. AWS accounted for more than half of Amazon's $19.2 billion in operating income. AWS' growth, driven partly by AI, will lead to much stronger profits thanks to the segment's higher margins.\n\nTrue, Amazon faces intense competition in cloud, but it has remained successful and benefits from switching costs within this business. Meanwhile, Amazon is also implementing AI throughout its business.\n\nThe company's fleet of more than 1 million industrial robots in its warehouses is utilizing AI to move about more efficiently. These initiatives will continue to pay off for Amazon. But there is more to the business.\n\nOne of Amazon's greatest strengths is the moat created by its brand name and the network effect of its e-commerce platform. Though e-commerce is not a particularly profitable business for the company, it has allowed it to establish its advertising business, which has been growing rapidly in recent years. E-commerce has also helped the company attract more than 200 million Amazon Prime subscribers, a large ecosystem of loyal customers that it can monetize in many different ways.\n\nSome of Amazon's newer initiatives include Amazon One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy, the latter of which has disrupted even well-established, legacy pharmacy chains. Amazon has long been looking to make waves in the healthcare field. Its current efforts look like winners and grant it yet another massive long-term growth avenue.\n\nSo, between AI, e-commerce, advertising, healthcare, Amazon's competitive edge, and an innovative culture focused on customer service, the company looks likely to perform well over the long run and deliver market-beating returns. Investors can hold this stock in their portfolios for the long term.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms makes most of its revenue from advertising, but the company has significantly improved that business thanks to AI.\n\nOn the one hand, it has used AI-powered algorithms to increase engagement on Facebook and Instagram. That automatically makes the company's ecosystem more attractive to advertisers. On the other hand, Meta Platforms introduced AI-powered tools to optimize the ad launch process, making it more productive for businesses. These initiatives are helping drive stronger results for the company.\n\nIn the second quarter, Meta Platforms' revenue increased by 22% year over year to $47.5 billion. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out that during the second quarter alone, AI-powered tools increased time spent on Facebook and Instagram by 5% and 6%, respectively. Also, thanks to AI, ad conversion grew by 3% and 5% on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMeta Platforms' other AI initiatives include its large language model, Llama, and its AI glasses developed through a partnership with Ray-Ban.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's ecosystem continues expanding. It ended the second quarter with 3.48 billion daily active users, representing a 6% increase compared to the year-ago period. Meta Platforms also benefits from a strong network effect. The company does have other long-term growth opportunities, including business messaging and its metaverse ambitions.\n\nMeta Platforms' advertising business should remain its most important for the foreseeable future, and thanks to AI, it is improving. Further, the company's extensive ecosystem of more than 3 billion daily users should enable it to identify additional growth opportunities.\n\nAll this means Meta Platforms looks like an excellent buy-and-forget stock.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:07:53.330111+00:00"}

But while the tech trade is proving resilient, even unstoppable, the firms that gained by helping people lose weight are faltering.\n\nHims & Hers Health (HIMS) fell as much as 5% Tuesday after the company reported revenue that missed expectations. Novo Nordisk (NVO), the drugmaker that ended a short-lived partnership with Hims and is entangled in a corporate quarrel with it, has also suffered, slashing profit forecasts for the weight-loss drug Wegovy and its diabetes treatment Ozempic.

Here we had IRL results, immediate and apparent, a breakthrough medical technology that helped people in ways that were easy to understand. The treatments, in some cases, made it easier for patients to curb destructive appetites. Meanwhile, for tech skeptics, the tens of billions of dollars thrown AI's way were an indulgence of Silicon Valley's worst fantasies. But now the GLP-1 trade is the one that's wavering.\n\nThe AI trade is not only flashing its staying power, as the tech giants post impressive earnings, but is acting like ballast amid trade and economic uncertainty. Tech tickers are the vanguard of the bull market and a calming force in the storm.\n\nTech titans don't claim to have a wonder drug. But that appears to be a strength, not a weak point. As mature, profitable companies, their AI businesses are pitched as extensions of their core operations and ethos. AI tech functions as variations and augmentations of their existing cloud, advertising, and search lines.\n\nIn that light, GLP-1 makers resemble one-hit wonders, where the AI giants are artists with a multitude of records that still hit.\n\nThe market for weight-loss drugs also exhibits signs of a zero-sum frenzy, where one company's success — promising results for a pill-based drug over injectables, or fewer side effects — is another's setback.\n\nTech bulls, in contrast, say that Nvidia and the tech giants create huge downstream value for software companies and others in the AI ecosystem.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:07:55.160189+00:00"}

Instead of finding the right keywords, the tool allows users to use images as their search starting point. Its Visual Language Models and industry-leading multimodal embedding models empower users to find exact content through a combination of text and image. Integration of such leading-edge generative AI tools will likely boost engagement on the platform. Pinterest also formed a collaboration with the championship-winning WNBA team, the New York Liberty. Through this partnership, Pinterest aims to bring exclusive content and in-game experiences to its platform, inspiring fans and expanding community outreach. Interest in women’s basketball is increasing steadily, and this collaboration will allow PINS to tap into the growing audience base in the WNBA. Such initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on the upcoming results.\n\nThe company also bolstered the AI-powered trends tool to better support advertisers in reaching their target market. The Pinterest Trend Tools offer brands insights based on how people search, save and shop on the platform. This is expected to gain solid market traction among retailers and advertisers.\n\nDuring the quarter, Pinterest introduced AI-powered auto collages, a cutting-edge tool that streamlines the creation process of engaging content. It provides stylish outfit ideas, identifies similar products and clusters them together, and creates collages by emulating content with strong user engagement. Collages are one of the most popular content types among Gen Zs. With the launch of this innovative AI-powered tool, the company is expanding its reach among Gen Z users.\n\nQualcomm currently has an ESP of -6.11% with a Zacks Rank #3.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is pegged at $974.61 million and 34 cents per share, respectively. Over the past 60 days, the earnings estimate for PINS for fiscal 2025 has increased 1.67% and for fiscal 2026, it has improved 1.41%.\n\nChicago, IL – August 6, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Pinterest, Inc. PINS, Snap Inc. SNAP and Meta Platforms, Inc. META.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Performance\n\nOver the past year, Pinterest has gained 34.6% compared to the industry’s growth of 58.3%. However, it has outperformed peers like Snap Inc. but lagged Meta Platforms, Inc. over this period. Snap has increased 6.5%, while META has surged 61.7% during this period.\n\nKey Valuation Metric of PINS\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Pinterest is currently trading at a premium compared to the industry and above its mean. Going by the price/sales ratio, the company shares currently trade at 5.86 forward sales, higher than 5.79 for the industry and higher than the stock’s mean of 5.2.\n\nInvestment Considerations\n\nPinterest’s growth strategy is focused on bringing more actionable content on the platform from a wide range of sources such as users, creators, publishers and retailers. Its state-of-the-art AI recommendation model works as a core element of the platform’s backend infrastructure. The company is doubling down on improving relevancy and actionability, leveraging AI, which is likely to drive user growth across all regions. Per our estimate, Pinterest’s global monthly active users are projected to reach 608.6 million in 2025, indicating 10.1% year-over-year growth. In the third quarter, global MAUs are expected to reach 571.8 million, suggesting 9.5% year-over-year growth.\n\nPinterest’s AI-powered trend tools are gaining strong popularity among advertisers. It allows advertisers to create and execute campaigns that target intent-based shoppers with enhanced content personalization. Moreover, enhancements in lower funnel solutions like mobile deep linking, shopping ads and API for conversions are providing a sustained return on investment to advertisers.\n\nHowever, the company is facing intense competition from various media companies such as Meta (including Facebook and Instagram), Google (including YouTube), Snap, and X. META is ramping up investment in an AI-powered recommendation system to increase engagement across its platforms. Snap is also continuously adding interactive features to make the Snapchat platform more attractive to users and advertisers.\n\nThese factors could pose a challenge to Pinterest’s expansion initiatives. Moreover, PINS’ heavy reliance on advertising as its major source of revenue is a concern. Any adverse changes in the advertising industry, shifts in advertiser preferences, or economic downturns can affect financial performance.\n\nEnd Note\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #3, Pinterest appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution. Intensifying competition and growing operating expenses are putting pressure on profitability. Macroeconomic headwinds remain a concern.\n\nHowever, the results of a single quarter are not so vital for long-term stakeholders. Investors who already own the stock may consider holding on to it as Pinterest is set to benefit from healthy traction in multiple verticals such as retail, financial services, auto, health and travel. Rising engagement among Gen Z users is a positive factor.

The company also said it has taken down over 6.8 million WhatsApp accounts linked to criminal scam centers targeting people around the world.\n\nThe new features are designed to help detect scams in both group and individual chats on the Meta-owned platform.\n\nFor group chats, WhatsApp is launching a safety overview feature that will be displayed when someone who isn’t in your contact list adds you to a new group that you may not recognize. The safety overview will include key information about the group, alongside tips to stay safe.\n\nFor example, you will see if the person who added you is one of your contacts, and if any member of the group is a contact of yours.\n\nIf you decide that you might recognize the group, you can choose to see the chat for more context. Either way, notifications from the chat will be muted until you mark that you want to remain in the group.\n\nImage Credits:WhatsApp\n\nAs for individual chats, WhatsApp notes that scammers might try to start conversations with you elsewhere on the internet before asking to message on private messaging services like WhatsApp. To protect against this tactic, the app is testing new ways to alert people before they start talking to someone who could be trying to scam them.\n\nFor example, it’s working to caution users when they start a chat with someone not in their contacts by showing them additional context about who they’re messaging.\n\nWhatsApp also shared information about how it worked alongside OpenAI to disrupt scam efforts that were traced back to a scam center in Cambodia.\n\n“These attempts ranged from offering payments for fake likes to enlisting others into a rent-a-scooter pyramid scheme, or luring people to invest in cryptocurrency,” WhatsApp explained in a blog post.\n\n“As OpenAI reported, the scammers used ChatGPT to generate the initial text message containing a link to a WhatsApp chat, and then quickly directed the target to Telegram, where they were assigned a task of liking videos on TikTok. The scammers attempted to build trust in their scheme by sharing how much the target has already ‘earned’ in theory, before asking them to deposit money into a crypto account as the next task.”\n\nWhatsApp says users can protect themselves from scams by taking time before responding to think about whether the message reads like a legitimate task.

You just tell it what you’re trying to do in the chat box, and the tool will either provide guidance, or take on the task for you, which could be a massive step for VR world creation.\n\nAs explained by Meta:\n\n“The Creator Assistant can be your new partner, working alongside your team, or just with you. This tool can help automate setup tasks, guide you with context-aware documentation and UI tips, support natural language brainstorming to design core loops and generate scripts, all with the aim of accelerating your creation journey and helping you complete your functional prototype.”\n\nAnd depending on how functional it is, it could be a significant step for VR development, and VR engagement more broadly, enabling anyone to build VR games and activities, which will let you experience wholly immersive digital worlds of your own design.\n\nSo if you really want to experience space travel, or parachuting, or deep sea diving. Just put on your headset, and speak it into existence, and eventually, Meta VR will populate that experience for you, in the moment.\n\nIn addition to this, Meta’s also rolling out a new “Style Reference,” which enables VR creation in different art styles.\n\n“Style Reference empowers you to easily generate, save, and reuse specific styles, ensuring consistent results across your creations. Whether you're designing detailed environments, crafting immersive audio, or building cohesive visual assets. Style Reference helps maintain a unified aesthetic and accelerates your workflow.”\n\nThe tools expand on Meta’s “Mesh Generation” and “Texture Generation” elements, which also enable users to generate VR environments via AI prompts.\n\nThrough this, Horizon creators can build entire virtual environments through AI prompts, without the need for in-depth programming or 3D modeling experience.\n\nThe updated chatbot expands this capacity even further, while also giving you more ways to build interactive experiences via AI agents, taking even more of the development workload off the user.\n\nWhich also means less technical knowledge is required, and eventually, we are indeed moving into Star Trek Holodeck-style territory, where you’ll simply be able to put on a VR headset and speak your intended experience into existence.\n\nThat could be a transformative step for VR adoption, enabling many, many more people to create engaging VR experiences. And the more options that are made available, the more likely that Meta will activate viral trends, which will then boost interest in VR overall.\n\nWhich comes back to is metaverse push, and the creation of innovative VR worlds that could eventually become the next plain of digital interaction.\n\nMeta’s not talking about the metaverse so much these days, but it remains a longer-term goal, and its developments like these that point to the potential of the metaverse shift, when it does become a thing.\n\nAnd it will. It seems inevitable that, eventually, VR interaction is going to become more mainstream, and that the platform which provides the best experiences within such stands to win out in a big way. It’s another pathway for Meta’s future success, alongside AI development, which, in combination, could make Meta the key facilitator of online interaction for years to come.\n\nIn addition to these updates, Meta’s also rolling out its latest Horizon Worlds AI creation tools to creators in India, Singapore, Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico. Its GenAI tools in the Worlds desktop editor are also now available to all creators across most of the European Union.\n\nSure, Meta’s cooled on its metaverse hype, as Zuckerberg has been distracted by the allure of AI, and sure, user interest in VR remains fairly muted at present.

WhatsApp’s rolling out a new safety overview that will be displayed when someone who’s not in your contacts adds you to a new WhatsApp group.\n\nAs you can see in this example, you’ll now get an overview of the group’s info before you join, which will also include tips on how to avoid scam activity.\n\nAs per WhatsApp:\n\n“From there, you can exit the group without ever having to look at the chat. And if you think you might recognize the group after seeing the safety overview, you can choose to see the chat for more context. Regardless, notifications from the group will be silenced until you mark that you want to stay.”\n\nThe up-front alerts about potential scams could be a significant deterrent, prompting more people to think twice before joining such.\n\nWhatsApp’s also testing new approaches to alert people when they get requests from people that they don’t know to chat.\n\n“For example, we’re exploring ways to caution you when you start a chat with someone not in your contacts by showing you additional context about who you’re messaging so you can make an informed decision.”\n\nThe added friction could have a significant impact in slowing scam activity, and raising awareness of possible issues within WhatsApp chats.\n\nWhich, as WhatsApp usage continues to grow, is an ongoing concern.\n\nOn that front, Meta’s also provided some insight into its efforts to combat scam center activity in its apps.\n\nMeta says that scam centers are often operated by organized crime gangs, and use forced labor to initiate large-scale scam activity.\n\n“In the first six months of this year, as part of our ongoing proactive work to protect people from scams, WhatsApp detected and banned over 6.8 million accounts linked to scam centers. Based on our investigative insights into the latest enforcement efforts, we proactively detected and took down accounts before scam centers were able to operationalize them.”\n\nThat’s consistent with Meta’s Community Standards Enforcement Reports, which shows that 99% of spam actions were removed from its apps.\n\nMeta’s systems are getting much better at detecting such before it gets through, however this is an ever-evolving problem, with no definitive solution.\n\nAs such, Meta needs to continually update its approaches to maintain detection, and ensure that users are protected from scams, as best they can be.\n\nAnd again, online scams, in general, are growing.\n\nAccording to new data from Pew Research, 73% of U.S. adults have ever experienced credit card fraud, ransomware and/or online shopping scams.\n\nThe FBI’s Internet Crime Report for 2024, meanwhile, indicates that scammers stole a record $16.6 billion from Americans in 2024.\n\nAs more and more of our daily activity shifts online, scammers are going to continue to target this element, and as such, it’s important that all platforms implement protection, however they can, to counter such.\n\nThese new measures from WhatsApp are another step in this direction.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:08:27.194364+00:00"}

The spending cycle is \"likely to benefit Oracle's OCI platform,\" Sills added.\n\nHowever, Sills reiterated a neutral call on the stock, citing a \"lack of clarity on the AI infrastructure debate\" for Oracle.\n\nOracle is battling to establish its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business as a serious competitor to Amazon and Microsoft. OCI is faster-growing but significantly smaller than Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Oracle got a big boost last month when it announced it will develop 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity for ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nStill, questions remain about how much it will cost Oracle to build up capacity to meet that demand, as well as the sustainability of AI-related computing demand.\n\n\"The bull/bear debate on the stock centers on how material the AI infrastructure opportunity is for Oracle and the magnitude of upside to topline growth targets,\" Sills wrote. \"At this point, there is little visibility on these fundamentals given the nascent stage of the AI infrastructure build.\"\n\nOracle Stock: Up 54% This Year\n\nOn the stock market today, Oracle stock is up a fraction at 252.79 in morning trades.\n\nOracle stock has rallied 54% year-to-date, helped by enthusiasm about its potential to be an AI winner. Last year, Oracle surged 60% to post the company's best share price-growth performance since 1999.\n\nAfter a rough start to the year, Oracle stock soared back to record highs with a 17% rally in July and 32% surge in June. A strong fiscal Q4 earnings report posted in early June helped bolster Wall Street's confidence Oracle will benefit from AI cloud demand. Oracle told investors last month that it expects cloud infrastructure revenue to grow 70% during fiscal 2026.

The gap with Nvidia is still massive, of course. But AMD doesn't need to be a clone—it just needs to be the alternative.\n\nAnd with export curbs hitting Nvidia's China business, AMD's more measured exposure could be an accidental advantage.\n\nThe takeaway? AMD might not wear the AI crown—but it's found the secret sauce to get invited to the royal table.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

Year to date, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index is up 13%, beating the S&P 500's return of about 7% at the time of this writing.\n\nInvesting in competitively positioned tech leaders has been a wealth-building strategy for many years, and that opportunity is certainly alive and well as companies adopt new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). Here are two top tech stocks that can outperform the market in 2025 and for years to come.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nShares of Meta Platforms (META 3.16%) are up 32% this year, outpacing the Nasdaq Composite's 9% gain, supported by strong financial results. The company's large user base of 3.4 billion daily active users continues to be a magnet for advertisers. As Meta continues to transform into an AI-driven business, the stock has a lot of room to run over the long term.\n\nMeta's investments in AI, including powerful tools for advertisers, have significantly increased the value of its platforms. Revenue grew 22% year over year in Q2, an acceleration over the 16% increase to start the year. AI is driving more personalization across its family of apps, and this is leading to growth in both ad impressions and the average price per ad.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has the business investing heavily in AI infrastructure to support greater personalization across its platforms. Its recent financial results show why this is crucial to its long-term prospects. The more personalization it can offer users, the stronger its competitive moat becomes, which will lead to more shareholder returns.\n\nMeta has reportedly been offering pay packages with $100 million signing bonuses to poach top engineers from other tech companies. The race to hire top talent is causing accelerating research and development expenses, which includes employee compensation. This is a major trend spreading across the tech sector, but Meta's cost management has been exceptional. Despite R&D expense shooting to the Moon, earnings per share grew 37% year over year in Q2.\n\nMeta Platforms is in a strong financial position. It ended the second quarter with $18 billion of net cash on the balance sheet, and it generated $50 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters. Despite the company's growth, the stock trades at a reasonable forward earnings multiple of 27, which is less than its recent earnings growth rate and should support market-beating returns.\n\n2. Reddit\n\nReddit (RDDT 1.40%) is benefiting from growth in the digital advertising market with its community-driven platform. This gives it a unique advantage against other social media platforms, and it's still growing off a relatively small base of revenue that could drive wealth-building returns for investors.\n\nThe user-created content and high engagement from its growing community of 110 million daily active users is a significant competitive advantage for Reddit. Revenue grew 78% year over year in Q2, which follows a 61% increase in Q1. This is outpacing the growth in its user base, which was up 21% year over year last quarter.\n\nThis signals that the investments which management is making in product improvements and the user experience are leading to growing engagement and higher average revenue per user (ARPU), similar to what Meta Platforms is seeing.\n\nReddit's ARPU growth has accelerated from just a 2% year-over-year increase in Q2 2024 to 47% in Q2 2025. The company is leveraging the valuable data that users create across the platform to help businesses tailor their ad strategies for maximum returns on ad spending. Reddit has an incredibly strong advantage here, since many of the discussion threads are infinitely varied across hobbies, shopping, and learning new things, providing a lot of valuable data on user interests.\n\nThe company's focus on improving the platform with new features, such as the AI-driven search tool Reddit Answers, should continue to drive engagement on the platform. Its improving ARPU growth may have a long way to run, which could benefit the stock.\n\nThe value that users get out of a platform with an infinite number of topics and information sharing can drive significant growth over the long term. Reddit is nowhere close to reaching its potential. It reported $499 million in quarterly revenue, or an annual run rate of about $2 billion, out of $276 billion annually spent on advertising across the social media market, according to Statista.\n\nAll this makes Reddit stock an excellent buy after falling from its previous highs this year.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:08:38.382307+00:00"}

Two, buybacks inflate EPS without necessarily improving true profitability. Three, buybacks may reduce investment in the business, especially if used to help meet executive compensation targets or earnings guidance.\n\n\"I do care about dividends, and I like to see dividends on the stocks in our portfolios,\" Crossmark chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. \"And so I think investors should be paying attention to this.

The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has gained 5.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $6.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +15.4%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.98 points to a change of +17.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +12.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $29.48 indicates a change of +5.3% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Meta Platforms.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:08:44.115703+00:00"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMeta is piloting the use of mass timber — a durable and renewable wood-based industrial substitute for concrete, steel and other building materials — to construct data centers with less embodied carbon emissions, the company announced Thursday.\n\nThe social media and tech conglomerate said it has successfully used mass timber to construct an administrative building at a South Carolina data center campus this year. The pilot will continue with the construction of additional buildings at Wyoming and Alabama, according to a July 31 blog pos t.\n\nMeta is not the only tech giant turning to mass timber — including cross-laminated timber (CLT) — to build more sustainable data centers. Last year, Microsoft announced it would use CLT in a hybrid construction strategy to build a pair of lower emissions data centers, combining the durable wood with steel and concrete.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMeta — the parent company behind Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — is adding mass timber to its lower-emissions construction strategy, part of its broader goal to reach net-zero emissions across its supply chain by 2030. Meta is also a member of the Rocky Mountain Institute’s Sustainable Steel Buyers platform and has previously piloted the use of low-carbon concrete in data centers.\n\nThe social media giant estimated that incorporating mass timber into its administrative buildings will decrease the embodied carbon emissions of those facilities by 41%, per the blog. Embodied emissions represent the greenhouse gas emissions over the lifecycle of building materials, spanning from extraction to construction to disposal, according to RMI. In addition to the wood having less lifecycle emissions than concrete or steel, the lower weight also reduces the amount of concrete necessary for the building’s foundation.\n\n“The carbon emissions associated with sustainably harvesting timber, milling it and manufacturing it to create usable materials for industrial application is typically far less than the emissions associated with manufacturing steel and concrete.” Meta said in the blog. “Low carbon materials like mass timber are necessary as we look for alternatives in construction to reach a net-zero future.”\n\nThe first administrative building Meta completed with mass timber was constructed at the company’s Aiken County, South Carolina campus this year, the company said. Meta received the wood building materials from SmartLam, and DPR led the construction.\n\nMeta will partner with Fortis Construction and Mercer Mass Timber to build additional mass timber buildings at its Cheyenne, Wyoming campus. Meanwhile, construction firm Hensel Phelps and mass timber company Binderholz will handle work at the tech giant’s Montgomery, Alabama site.\n\nMeta said it plans to experiment with using mass timber in more administrative buildings, warehouses and data halls going forward.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:08:46.937404+00:00"}

Well, when you look at tariffs, clearly, with India, with China, with Brazil, he's still pursuing an aggressive policy of high tariffs, but there's also been a lot of great trade deals that have been done where companies have committed to trillions investment in the US and more reciprocity in trade where countries had not had that reciprocity before.

Stress on the grid is sending Americans' electricity bills higher , and the US is losing ground to foreign competitors looking to host the new generation of computing hubs that hold and process data generated by some of the most powerful companies in the world.\n\nClosing that gap, according to eight different analysts, researchers, and energy traders who spoke with Yahoo Finance, will require a long lead time, an intensive amount of new energy infrastructure development, and an enormous amount of capital.\n\nIn some of the country's most important markets, this \"misalignment of expectations\" could equal a lag of at least one to two years, if not longer, before the power that data center developers are seeking is actually available, according to a July report by clean energy fuel cell provider Bloom Energy ( BE ).\n\nBut America's tech industry may be overestimating just how much pressure the power grid can take — and how quickly the nation's utilities will actually be able to meet the rampant demand. Aging infrastructure well beyond its useful life, decades of stagnant industrial investment, and years-long delays in getting new power connected to the grid may put a wrench in Big Tech's plans.\n\n\"The large data center developers and their hyperscaler customers want power right away,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of electricity infrastructure consulting firm Grid Strategies.\n\nIn turn, US electricity demand has exploded and is projected to grow five times faster over the next 10 years than it did in the previous decade, according to research from Bank of America ( BAC ). And these companies are showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe world's largest tech companies are waging a power-driven arms race to be at the forefront of the computing and AI technology wave. These so-called hyperscalers — including tech giants like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOG ), and Oracle ( ORCL ) — have poured money into pushing artificial intelligence development and computing ability ever further.\n\nFor more than a decade, the demand for power across the US has been nearly stagnant, growing by less than 1% per year. Then came the data center revolution.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDunne's company stands to benefit.\n\nPower play\n\nAcross the globe, a web of thousands of data centers is springing up, from “Data Center Alley” in Loudoun County, Va., to Richland Parish in the northeastern corner of rural Louisiana and Kolkata, India, and it forms the backbone of the AI and cloud-computing industries.\n\nGlobal power usage by data centers is expected to grow from a current level of around 55 gigawatts to 84 gigawatts — equivalent to the power usage of roughly 70 million homes — in only the next two years, according to research from Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnd the biggest names in tech are only increasing their plans for more.\n\nIn December, Meta (META) announced plans to spend $10 billion building the largest data center hub in the Western Hemisphere, 250 miles north of New Orleans. The site, which Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg has said will be bigger than the island of Manhattan, is expected to come online in 2030.\n\nThis year, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta alone are expected to spend $364 billion in capital expenditures, much of it going toward AI technology development.\n\nBut the increasing demand from data centers that each require a power draw equivalent to thousands of homes is running up against an aging and largely stagnant North American grid, threatening stability.\n\n\"The size and speed at which large data centers, typically developed to support the computing needs for AI and cryptocurrency mining, are expanding across the country\" represents a \"significant near-term reliability challenge,\" according to research from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a nonprofit deputized by the federal government to regulate the power grid.\n\nTo understand the problem, you have to understand how the grid works. At a basic level, electricity follows a roughly three-step process to reach a home, a data center, or any other endpoint.\n\nA power source, such as the Linden Cogeneration Plant that lights up the night sky outside New York City or the soaring towers of Georgia's nuclear Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, generates energy. That energy is then transmitted across power lines that crisscross the country. Once it reaches its destination, the electricity is distributed to the tangle of smaller lines that many Americans see running through their communities and that carry it to its final destination.\n\nThe generation sources, such as coal plants and solar farms, determine capacity, or how much power is actually available for use. And the market is already capacity-constrained.\n\n\"We've grown accustomed to several decades of pretty slow demand growth in the electric sector, and the last few years have really turned that on its head,\" Brendan Pierpont, the director of electric modeling at the research organization Electric Innovation, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe gap has already begun to push tech developers to look abroad. While the US still claims the dominant share of data center power markets globally, the rest of the world is gaining ground. The Asia Pacific region has seen the lion's share of added power supply over the last decade, according to Goldman Sachs research. Beijing is now the world's second-largest market for hyperscaler power capacity, only behind the US's northern Virginia region, according to reports from Synergy Research Group.\n\nTo be sure, North America is projected to have the largest amount of new power coming online in the next five years out of any global region. But fresh development takes a long time.\n\nOn the shorter end of the spectrum, Goldman Sachs utilities analyst Carly Davenport told Yahoo Finance, a company like NextEra could likely bring a solar or wind facility into service within 18 to 24 months. But if the goal is to bring on serious capacity through a project at the scale of a gas plant, where new builds on average have added four times the capacity of a new solar build, or a much larger capacity nuclear power plant, the timeline is much longer. In the meantime, hyperscalers may have to find other answers.\n\n\"If you are deciding today that you want to build new gas, you likely will not be able to take delivery of a turbine until 2029,\" Davenport said. \"If you're wanting to build new nuclear, that's something that we think is more [of] a mid-2030s type event to actually get that online.\"\n\nAnd once a new generation resource is built, it often has to sit in a years-long queue just to get connected to the grid. At PJM Interconnection, the grid operator of the largest power market in the US, the process to get grid-connected takes five years on average, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nOnly around a fifth of the generation projects that requested grid connection between 2000 and 2018 were in commercial operation by 2023, the Laboratory found.\n\nEnough to keep the hyperscalers happy?

Photo by Kena Betancur/VIEWpress) · VIEW press via Getty Images\n\nThe $800 billion push\n\nWork on the infrastructure that brings power from source to destination — the transformers and power lines running throughout the country — has also remained largely stagnant.\n\nThirty-one percent of transmission equipment and 46% of distribution equipment in the US are within five years of the end of their useful life or have already passed that point, according to research from Bank of America. Across the country's electric utilities, which deliver energy to customers and maintain the infrastructure required to do so, two-thirds of 2024 spending went toward replacing existing infrastructure, the bank found.\n\nAnd the pace of new grid development has been slowing down.\n\nThe US built an average of 1,700 miles of transmission infrastructure per year through the first half of the 2010s, but the back half of the decade saw only 645 miles built on average per year, according to Grid Strategies.\n\nTo be sure, data centers are also not the only things pulling on the grid. Electrification mandates, electric vehicle development, and other power-hungry technologies like cryptocurrency mining all continue to exert pressure on a strained grid.\n\n\"I think what's happening is sort of refocusing to people, 'Hey, we have these assets that are now approaching 30 to 40 years [of operation], and not only do you need to replace them, you need to upgrade them,\" Bank of America industrials analyst Andrew Obin told Yahoo Finance. \"If you run the grid without real money for 20 years, things start to break.\"\n\nIn response, the utilities industry is not sitting still.\n\nGE Vernova (GEV), which supplies equipment to customers including AI and cloud-computing data center developers, utilities companies, and industrial-scale power projects, saw its orders for power-related equipment increase by more than 40% in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024, according to the company's latest earnings report. The company has received $500 million in orders specifically for data center electrification this year, compared to $600 million throughout all of 2024, CEO Scott Strazik said on the earnings call.\n\nBut meeting the growing need will require an immense amount of both capital and labor.\n\nUtilities are now expected to spend $800 billion over the next five years, compared to only $550 billion spent between 2020 and 2024, Goldman Sachs' Davenport told Yahoo Finance, and the US is projected to need to add more than 500,000 jobs by 2030 in the electric sector.\n\nMarket stress\n\nEach year, PJM holds a capacity auction to determine the lowest pay-rate energy producers are willing to accept from the grid operator to guarantee that they will be ready to provide power at any time during the delivery period covered by the auction, usually several years out.\n\nIn this summer's auction, generators offered an additional 2,669 megawatts of power supplies to be added through infrastructure upgrades and new builds.\n\nIt was the first time in the past four auctions that new capacity was added. But the additions only meet around half of the demand PJM is expecting to see over the coming three years. That impact will show up in Americans' electricity bills.\n\nIn PJM's 2024 auction, the utility's clearing price — the end price that determines what it has to pay all participating power generators — was $269.92 per megawatt-day, an 800% increase from the previous year.\n\nThat December, after utilities companies warned customers in PJM-covered Pennsylvania that monthly bill prices could increase by $15, Governor Josh Shapiro filed a lawsuit against PJM, claiming the grid operator's poor processing capabilities had harmed customers and created \"potentially the largest unjust wealth transfer in the history of U.S. energy markets.\"\n\nIn response, PJM filed a proposal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to create a price collar for the coming auctions that was accepted and put into effect.\n\nThis year's auction saw prices clear levels more than 20% higher, at $329.17 per MW-day, which is the price cap established by the PJM proposal. This is expected to raise consumers' electric bills in PJM's coverage area — 13 states across the mideast region of the country plus Washington, D.C. — by 1.5%-5%, on average, according to the operator.\n\nThis effect is not constrained to only the country's biggest or fastest-growing markets.\n\nIf a developer cannot find power in one market or is unwilling to accept proposed timelines, several experts told Yahoo Finance, it will go elsewhere until it finds a market that suits its needs.\n\n\"The stress on every grid from increased electricity demand doled out by data center clusters is noticeable,\" Brad Jones, managing partner of power-trading specialist hedge fund Standard Normal, told Yahoo Finance. \"We are really and truly seeing it everywhere.\"\n\nAaron Tinjum, the vice president of energy at the Data Center Coalition trade association, which counts Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Oracle as members, told Yahoo Finance that while the industry has largely tried to \"right-size infrastructure and minimize any unnecessary costs, the data center industry has also experienced the acute impacts of under-forecasting and insufficient communication\" that have created \"multi-year project delays in key data center markets.\"\n\n\"While we recognize that grid planning and management is ultimately the role of utilities, grid operators, and regulators, the data center industry has been actively leaning in as a committed and engaged partner across the country to help advance and accelerate grid modernization and energy infrastructure to support American economic competitiveness and national security,\" Tinjum said.\n\nOver the long term, US capacity is largely expected to meet demand, Davenport told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe NERC has projected that several hundred gigawatts of capacity from new generation are expected to arrive within the decade.\n\nBut in the meantime, the gap between supply and demand has pushed the biggest tech players to search for other solutions.\n\nIn March 2024, Amazon Web Services announced a deal worth $650 million with power producer and energy infrastructure operator Talen Energy (TLN). In return for that sum, Talen is set to provide Amazon with more than 1.9 gigawatts of energy from its Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, one of the largest nuclear plants in the country, to power a data center site directly adjacent to the plant.\n\nThen in September 2024, Microsoft inked a deal with Constellation Energy (CEG) to purchase power that Constellation plans to generate by bringing one of two reactors at the decommissioned Three Mile Island nuclear plant back online by 2028.\n\nElectricity Innovation's Pierpont told Yahoo Finance that he expects hyperscalers and other large tech players to increasingly pursue deals like Amazon's and Microsoft's as they look at how much power they can generate themselves on-site — especially as data center development shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nAlphabet recently announced on its Q2 earnings call that data centers and networking equipment made up a full third of its $22.4 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, while Microsoft said it will spend $80 billion by the end of the year to \"build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.\"\n\n\"Helping accelerate growth while also making sure we pay our fair share for the electricity to serve our operations is critical for Google,\" Alphabet said in a statement provided to Yahoo Finance. \"Our priority is to help responsibly scale grid systems, making them more reliable, resilient and affordable for everyone.\"\n\nAmazon implied on its Q4 2024 earnings call that it will spend around $63 billion on capex in the second half of 2025, and Oracle predicted in its Q4 earnings call that the \"vast majority\" of its projected $25 billion-plus in capex will be spent on \"equipment that is going into data centers and not for land or buildings.\"\n\n“We work closely with utilities and grid operators to plan for future growth,\" Amazon said in a statement. \"Where we require specific infrastructure to meet our needs (such as new substations), we work to make sure that we’re covering those costs and that they aren’t being passed on to other ratepayers.\"\n\nTech players have begun to announce initiatives to ease some of the burden of their grid draw. Google recently signed agreements with two US utilities to operate a \"demand response\" model for its data centers that can \"shift or reduce\" power during peak demand times, which the company said will help to get new developments grid-connected more quickly, reduce the need for new capacity, and make it easier for operators to better manage power grids.\n\nBut activist groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) say they haven't seen the tech players live up to their claims.\n\n\"As state regulators respond to growing demand, the data center industry has demonstrated a lack of transparency about their energy use and an unwillingness to aggressively push for state and federal policy that would unlock barriers to the clean energy and transmission infrastructure needed to meet their stated goals,\" SELC climate initiative leader Alys Campaigne told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSELC has threatened Elon Musk's xAI with lawsuits over its Colossus data center project in Memphis that activists say involved installing gas turbines without proper permitting. SELC has also worked with other activist groups to block data center developments.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta, and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPower hungry: Construction at an Amazon Web Services data center on Aug. 22, 2024, in Boardman, Ore. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane) · ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFor its part, the energy industry is likely to push back plans to retire existing gas and coal plants that can provide steady capacity, even if they are at or near the point of decommissioning, Goldman Sachs' Davenport and Bank of America's Obin told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"You could push those [retirement timelines] out and to the right to a degree to try to bridge the gap,\" Davenport said. \"They're not getting pushed out to the right by 10 years, but could you see two, three-year push-outs? I think that's absolutely reasonable.\"\n\nThe industrial sector is also likely to push harder on existing infrastructure that might not be operating at its full capacity limit, Obin said.\n\nAnd regulators such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are finding ways to step in, including by forcing PJM to reform its grid connection queue process to make sure new energy resources like the more than 100 GW of solar capacity currently in its pipeline can get plugged in more effectively.\n\nIn the meantime, as the grid works to grow and manage increased loads, the major tech developers will be forced to adapt, the experts who spoke with Yahoo Finance said.\n\nIf renewable energy sources such as new solar and wind developments remain stuck in connection pipelines, some companies may join xAI in looking toward non-renewable solutions like gas turbines that they can quickly bring online.\n\n\"A lack of capital is not the most pressing bottleneck for AI progress,\" Dan Dees, Goldman Sachs' co-head of global banking and markets, said in a report from the bank on AI's energy demand. \"It's the power needed to fuel it.\"\n\nJake Conley is a breaking news reporter covering US equities for Yahoo Finance.

AMZN, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Meta Platforms, Inc. META.\n\nWatch These 3 \"Mag 7\" Stocks Showing Positive Momentum\n\nRichard Driehaus has secured a spot in Barron’s All-Century Team thanks to a strategy based on the \"buy high and sell higher\" theory. This approach is undeniably effective for selecting top momentum stocks.\n\nTo that end, the magnificent seven stocks like Amazon.com, Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms, Inc. have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.\n\nA Detailed Look Into the Driehaus Strategy\n\nRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said, “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) considered the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.\n\nIt is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.\n\nMoreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.\n\nHere are three of the 13 stocks:\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising and subscription services through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Amazon has a Momentum Score of A. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for AMZN is 23%, on average.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet provides a range of products and platforms across multiple regions, including the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America. Alphabet has a Momentum Score of B. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for GOOGL is 16%, on average.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms focuses on creating products that allow individuals to connect and share with friends and family using mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality, mixed reality headsets, augmented reality and wearables globally. Meta Platforms has a Momentum Score of A. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for META is 20.5%, on average.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:09:08.757711+00:00"}

I think Meta Platforms (META 3.16%) could join them.\n\nMeta owns social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, but it has also become a clear leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) race thanks to its Llama family of large language models (LLMs), which are among the most powerful in the industry.\n\nMeta stock soared by 11% on July 31, after the company reported a stellar set of operating results for the second quarter of 2025 (which ended on June 30). The move lifted its market capitalization to almost $2 trillion, meaning investors who buy the stock today could earn a return of 50% if it ascends into the $3 trillion club. Here's why I think it will get there sooner rather than later.\n\nAI is supercharging Meta's business\n\nAlmost 3.5 billion people were using at least one of Meta's social media apps every day during the second quarter of 2025. As that figure approaches half of the global population, it will become harder to attract new users, which will have consequences for the company's advertising revenue in the future. However, Meta can also generate more advertising dollars by increasing the amount of time each user spends on its apps, and AI is central to that strategy.\n\nMeta's recommendation engine uses AI to learn what type of content each user enjoys viewing, and then it feeds them more of it. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said this resulted in a 6% increase in the amount of time users spent on Instagram during the second quarter, and a 5% increase on Facebook. Simply put, the longer each user spends online, the more ads they see, and the more money Meta makes.\n\nAI also boosts the efficiency of Meta's ad-recommendation model by targeting users more accurately, which led to a 5% increase in conversions on Instagram during the second quarter and a 3% increase on Facebook. Businesses will normally pay more money per ad when conversions are increasing, which is another big tailwind for Meta.\n\nHigher engagement and more conversions sent Meta's second-quarter revenue soaring 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, which was comfortably above the company's forecast range of $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion. Management also issued bullish guidance for the third quarter (which ends on Sept. 30), telling investors the company's revenue could top $50 billion for the first time ever.\n\nZuckerberg says AI superintelligence is in sight\n\nMeta launched its Llama family of LLMs in early 2023. They are open source so Meta leans on a community of millions of developers to troubleshoot technical issues, which is why they have caught up to the best closed-source models so quickly. The latest Llama 4 models now rival the most advanced releases from top start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nMeta is using the Llama models to power new features across its social media apps, which is another way it's boosting engagement. The Meta AI chatbot, for instance, already has over 1 billion monthly active users who tap into its capabilities for homework assistance, image generation, and everything in between.\n\nZuckerberg says AI superintelligence -- which is when AI models surpass human intelligence by every metric -- is now in sight. Whoever reaches this milestone first could have a significant advantage over every other AI developer, which is why Zuckerberg recently established a new division called Meta Superintelligence Labs. Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang will lead the team, after selling 49% of his company to Meta in a $14 billion deal in June.\n\nBut achieving superintelligence won't be cheap. Meta allocated $17 billion to capital expenditures (capex) during the second quarter alone, most of which went toward building data center infrastructure and buying chips from suppliers like Nvidia. The company also increased its capex forecast for 2025; it now expects to spend between $66 billion to $72 billion, up from $64 billion to $72 billion previously.\n\nThe gigantic capex spending could dent Meta's profitability in the short term, but the company hopes it will lead to accelerated growth over the long run as AI (and potentially superintelligence) improves user engagement and ad conversions even further.\n\nMeta has a clear path to the $3 trillion club\n\nFortunately, Meta's strong beat at the top line led to a very strong result at the bottom line during the second quarter. Its earnings per share (EPS) soared by 38% year over year to $7.14, crushing Wall Street's estimate of $5.92. It carried the company's trailing-12-month EPS to $27.62, which places its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 28.\n\nThat's a noteworthy discount to the Nasdaq-100 index, which is trading at a P/E ratio of 32.7, and it's an even steeper discount to the median P/E ratio of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, which stands at 38.1. The Magnificent Seven (which includes Meta) is an elite group of technology companies operating on the front lines of the AI industry.\n\nTherefore, despite logging an eye-popping 200% gain over the last five years alone, Meta stock might still be undervalued. It would have to rise by a further 36.1% just to trade in line with the median P/E ratio of the Magnificent Seven, which would catapult its market cap to almost $2.7 trillion. At that point, Meta's annualized EPS would have to grow by just 11% to push its market cap above $3 trillion.\n\nMeta grew its EPS at a compound annual rate of 36% during the recent decade between 2014 and 2024. That growth rate is unsustainable over the long term for any company, but Meta's EPS soared at an above-trend pace of 37% during the first quarter of 2025, and then 38% in the second quarter, so it should have no trouble mustering 11% growth over the next year or two.\n\nEven if Meta's P/E ratio holds steady at 28 -- which I predict is unlikely because it seems so cheap -- it's only a matter of time before the company's rapid earnings growth carries it into the exclusive $3 trillion club.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:09:10.108634+00:00"}

And shares of Palantir Technologies have surged 104% year to date, bringing its market value to $365 billion. That means the companies are collectively worth $4.6 trillion.\n\nI think Meta Platforms (META 3.16%) can surpass that figure in five years. The company is currently worth $1.9 trillion, so its market value needs to increase 150% to $4.7 trillion by 2030 to satisfy my prediction. In that scenario, the stock would return about 20% annually.\n\nMy forecast is aggressive, but investors have good reason to think Meta is equal to the challenge. Here's why.\n\nMeta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to strengthen its ad tech business\n\nMeta Platforms owns three of the four most popular social media platforms in Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp as measured by monthly active users. Those three platforms also ranked among the four most downloaded social applications for mobile devices last year, meaning the company is successfully defending its dominant position in the industry.\n\nMeta currently earns the vast majority of its revenue from advertising. Its ad tech tools help brands reach consumers with relevant ads across its social media platforms, as well as third-party websites and mobile applications. What advertisers are willing to pay depends on user engagement and campaign performance, and the company is leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) to improve both metrics.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg recently told analysts, \"AI is significantly improving our ability to show people content that they're going to find interesting and useful.\" Improved recommendations led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase in time spent on Instagram in the second quarter. Also, more brands used Meta's AI creative tools, leading to 3% more ad conversions on Facebook and 5% more on Instagram.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Meta Platforms is the second largest ad tech company, behind only Alphabet's Google, and it is successfully using AI to strengthen its value proposition for consumers and brands. Ad tech spending is forecast to increase at 14% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. That gives Meta a good shot at similar earnings growth within its advertising segment.\n\nMeta Platforms dominates the burgeoning smart glasses market\n\nMeta Platforms is currently the leading supplier of smart glasses. The company accounted for over 60% of shipments last year as the market tripled in size. And growth is projected to remain robust in the years ahead. Counterpoint Research says smart glasses shipments will grow faster than 60% annually through 2029.\n\nOther analysts are a little less optimistic. Grand View Research estimates smart glasses sales will increase at 27% annually through 2030. Nevertheless, CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks smart glasses could slowly replace smartphones (or at least reduce their importance) in the next 15 years, especially once lenses are embedded with augmented reality displays.\n\nThat could make Meta Platforms the Apple of the 2030s. To elaborate, whereas Apple was a sensational investment over the past two decades in large part because of the success of the iPhone, Meta could see similar success in the next two decades if smart glasses do indeed become the form factor of choice in personal computing and mobile communications.\n\nWhy Meta Platforms could be worth $4.7 trillion by 2030\n\nTo summarize, Meta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to strengthen its advertising business, and the company is also an early leader in the smart glasses market. In turn, Wall Street analysts expect its earnings to grow at 17% annually over the next three to five years. That makes the current valuation of 27 times earnings look reasonable.\n\nHowever, Meta Platforms beat the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 18% in the last four quarters, meaning Wall Street has routinely underestimated the company. If that trend continues, earnings could grow at 21% annually over the next five years, in which case its market value could hit $4.7 trillion (more than Nvidia and Palantir combined today) while its valuation fell to 26 times earnings.\n\nImportantly, while I am moderately confident in the scenario I've outlined, Meta Platforms is still a smart long-term investment even if its market value does not reach $4.7 trillion in five years. Patient investors should consider buying a small position today.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:09:11.694199+00:00"}

While the spending may seem reckless to Wall Street due to the sheer size, META is already enjoying significant returns on its AI investments, unlike most AI companies. In Meta’s recent earnings conference call, visionary CEO Mark Zuckerberg featured five ways AI will drive META, including:\n\n“Improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices.”\n\nAI is driving increased time spent on its core social media offerings. AI optimization has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram – leading to better returns for Meta’s ad business (which makes up ~97% of revenue). Meanwhile, Zuckerberg made a shocking forward-looking statement that suggests that his company’s AI is the best or near the best, saying:\n\n“Developing superintelligence – which we define as AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way – we think is now in sight.”\n\nMETA: Post Earnings Drift Set-up\n\nLast week, META blew away Wall Street EPS expectations, marking the company’s eleventh consecutive earnings beat.\n\nFollowing its earnings beat last week, META shares bolted more than 11% as volume swelled to 220% above the norm.

The stock is up less than 2% through July 31. Contrast this to digital advertising and AI rival Meta Platforms, which saw shares jump over 30% in that time.\n\nHowever, after its second-quarter earnings report beat Wall Street expectations, Alphabet stock began to climb and is hovering not far from the 52-week high of $207.05 set in February. The recent resurgence could signal a turning point.\n\nAs a result, now is a good time to evaluate whether an investment in Alphabet makes sense. Doing so requires digging into where the tech giant stands today.\n\nAlphabet's recent performance\n\nExcellent second-quarter results understandably boosted its stock. Revenue was up a strong 14% year over year to $96.4 billion. Net income rose to $28.2 billion, a 19% increase compared to 2024.\n\nConsequently, diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared 22% year over year to $2.31, exceeding Wall Street's consensus estimate of $2.18. While this growth is impressive, a key reason to consider investing in Alphabet is its success in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to CEO Sundar Pichai, Google's search traffic is growing year over year, \"and our new AI experiences significantly contributed to this increase in usage.\" AI's boost to Google is noteworthy, since the search engine accounted for $54.2 billion of Alphabet's $96.4 billion in second-quarter sales.\n\nAI is also benefiting Alphabet's other businesses, such as Google Cloud. That division saw second-quarter revenue rise an impressive 32% year over year to $13.6 billion as customers were drawn to Google Cloud's AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence also plays a crucial role in (literally) driving Alphabet's autonomous car service, Waymo. With that technology behind the wheel, it delivers over a quarter-million passenger trips every week.\n\nThe company is slowly expanding Waymo to more cities. Atlanta is the latest location, initiated in June, adding to places such as Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.\n\nWaymo also signed a multiyear deal with Avis in July, as the rental car company expands into ride-hailing services, providing Waymo with operational support, including vehicle maintenance.\n\nFactors to consider with an Alphabet investment\n\nThe company is determined to be a leader in AI. That's why it has made prodigious capital expenditures (capex) to boost its AI infrastructure. The second quarter's $22.4 billion in capex represented the highest sum yet in any given quarter over the past four, and far above the $13.2 billion spent in the prior year's second quarter.\n\nIts huge spending left the company with $5.3 billion in second-quarter free cash flow (FCF). While that amount is down from the previous year's $13.2 billion, a single quarter's dip is not a concern. Alphabet has exceptional ability to generate FCF, producing a princely sum of $66.7 billion over the trailing 12 months.\n\nThe larger issue is that Alphabet was found guilty of antitrust violations in its digital advertising and Google Search businesses. This has been a factor in the tepid performance of its stock.\n\nThe courts have yet to announce the company's punishment, but once it's made public, the shares are likely to be affected to some degree, depending on the consequences to its business.\n\nManagement is appealing the rulings, and this could cause the antitrust cases to drag on for years, according to Pichai.\n\nAs a result, the threat to Alphabet's business isn't immediate. And ultimately, the legal challenges could be resolved with minimal impact, as was the result in a similar antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998, which concluded in a settlement.\n\nTo buy or not to buy Alphabet shares\n\nIn weighing whether to invest in Alphabet, one factor to consider is share price valuation. This can be assessed using its stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, especially in comparison to competitors Microsoft and Meta. Both compete with Alphabet in digital advertising, while Microsoft is also a rival in cloud computing.\n\nThe chart above shows that Alphabet's P/E multiple is the lowest compared to Meta and Microsoft, suggesting its stock is the best value versus the competition. This is underscored by the fact the company's earnings multiple is lower than it's been over the past year, up until President Donald Trump's announcement of tariff policy changes in April sank the entire stock market.\n\nAlthough the antitrust cases present short-term uncertainty, the company's deep pockets and commitment to battling the court rulings can help it navigate these challenges. With strong financials, successful AI initiatives, and an attractive valuation, now is a good time to consider buying shares in Alphabet.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:09:21.100244+00:00"}

You may now have a means to do just that.\n\nIn recent weeks, you may have noticed a new “Value Rules” setting in your Meta campaign set-up options, providing another way to target your ads, by increasing your bid limits for certain audience subsets.\n\nMeta’s Value Rules have been available for some advertisers for some time, but they were recently expanded to more accounts. And as the title sounds, Value rules enable you to focus on different users based on specific behaviors, demographics, and more, in order to reach the most valuable potential customers for your products.\n\nBut in basic terms, Value Rules will help you reach people who are more specifically aligned with your goals.\n\nAs explained by Meta ads expert Jon Loomer:\n\n“When running sales campaigns, you can optimize for conversion value rather than volume. Meta will then show your ads to people most likely to make higher value purchases.”\n\nPretty simple. In this application, Meta’s Value Rules would essentially give you a way to target people who are more likely to spend more money on your products, based on their past history of ad interactions, conversions, etc.\n\nBut that’s not the only way to use the option.\n\nValue Rules also enable you to get more specific with your bids, across a range of categories.\n\nAs explained by Meta:\n\n“For example, if you know that men aged 25-44 have an average 60% higher lifetime value and women 25-44 have a 20% lower lifetime value relative to customers outside of these dimensions, you can use value rules to increase your bid by 60% for the male 25-44 age group and decrease your bid by 20% for the female 25-44 age group. People outside of these value rules will receive a non-adjusted bid.”\n\nSo you can also focus on specific audience subsets, based on expanded targeting parameters, in which you set a variable value for your bid/s.\n\nValue Rules can be based on user age, gender, operating system, location and placement (e.g. Instagram feed, Facebook feed, Stories, Reels, and Marketplace), giving you a heap of options for potential optimization in targeting.\n\nSounds interesting?\n\nWell, there are some additional parameters and notes to consider.\n\nFirst off, Meta notes that when you create a value rule set, the order of your rules will dictate which adjustments its system will prioritize.\n\n“If you create rules with audience overlap, we’ll only use the first applicable rule to adjust the bid. For example, rule 1 states you are willing to bid 20% more for women in California and rule 2 states you are willing to bid 50% more for women who use a particular mobile operating system. If a woman in California who uses that operating system is in your audience, then we will only apply Rule 1 to bid 20% more for her because it is the first rule in the order.”\n\nThat could be a consideration, depending on how many rules you set, and how complex you want to get with your various parameters.\n\nMeta also notes that:\n\n“When you use value rules, you may see more conversions from your preferred audiences, but your overall cost per result may increase.”\n\nAnother consideration.\n\nMeta also advises that marketers should rely on their own business order data to dictate their bid rules:\n\n“If you earn $115 in ROAS from women, and $100 from men, women may be worth 15% more to your business. You could set a +15% value rule for women.”\n\nI mean, this one probably goes without saying, you’re going to have to measure the value of your ads, and factor that into what you’re looking to prioritize, which can get complex.\n\nMeta also notes that you can refer to the value rules breakdown in Ads Manager at the ad set level to see breakdowns of results by each rule.\n\nMeta ads expert Jon Loomer also notes that while Value Rules do give advertisers more control, they may not be necessary in many cases, and could actually limit your results.\n\nWhich is the case that Meta’s been pushing with its own Advantage+ AI-based ad targeting, that its systems are now getting much better at identifying your ideal ad audience for you, which often sees it displaying your ads to people that you wouldn’t have targeted through manual options.\n\nSo it may well be worth testing out Value Rules versus Advantage+ targeting, to see which produces better results. In its Q2 performance update last week, Meta noted that its AI-powered recommendation model for ads had driven a 5% improvement in ad conversions on Instagram, and a 3% improvement on Facebook. Those aren’t crazy high increases, but it does show that Meta’s Advantage+ targeting is improving, and could help you reach more people that you may have missed through more specific manual targeting.\n\nEssentially, Value Rules will give you more control, and if you have data which points to specific audiences that you want to exclude, or your order info points to key demographic qualifiers that generate more value for your brand, they may be of value. But the data to support your decisions is important, because gut feel could end up costing you in results.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:09:25.357572+00:00"}
