Investing in these companies is a genius move, as they are vital.\n\nOne of them, in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm, is ASML (ASML 2.81%). ASML makes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines used in the chip manufacturing process. Without ASML, the advanced chip technology used today wouldn't be possible. As a result, it's one of the most important companies in the world.\n\nHowever, ASML's stock is flat year to date and down around 35% from its all-time high. With other tech giants constantly hitting new all-time highs in the current market, is ASML well positioned to do the same?\n\nASML's machines are used by foundries worldwide\n\nASML's technology is vital for cutting-edge chip fabricators. The chip foundry industry has only three major players: Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, and Samsung. Taiwan Semiconductor has been the biggest winner by far and is constructing new fabrication facilities worldwide to meet rising chip demand, driven by AI, including a $165 billion investment in the U.S. alone. Demand for ASML machines is mainly coming from Taiwan Semi, because the other two have been losing business.\n\nIt's no secret that Intel's foundry business has struggled. It's currently losing money, and Intel's CEO has indicated that it isn't willing to invest heavily in the business in an attempt to revitalize it. It will invest in capacity only if it can find a customer first.\n\nConsidering Intel's poor track record in the foundry business recently, this is a terrible idea, as Intel needs to showcase its prowess before it can take such an approach. Intel's business will likely continue to deteriorate, which causes a headwind for ASML amid less demand for its cutting-edge machines.\n\nSamsung isn't seeing as much success as TSMC, but it's also not struggling like Intel. Samsung has invested in new plants and recently partnered with Tesla to produce its AI6 chips. This partnership could cause increased demand, leading to more ASML machines being purchased.\n\nWith some of ASML's major customers not needing the capacity and TSMC, which is known for pushing ASML's machines to their technological limits, sometimes reluctant to upgrade them, the future isn't as bright for ASML as one might expect.\n\nThis pessimism showed up in ASML's financial results. Before Q2 earnings, management was adamant that 2026 would be a growth year, just as it had expected 2025 to be. Now management is taking this stance: \"While we are still preparing for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage.\"\n\nThat's concerning for investors, which is why ASML's stock has done so poorly. However, the outlook beyond 2026 is still bright, and long-term investors (those willing to hold for at least five years) should still be excited about the stock.\n\nASML's long-term outlook is still intact\n\nOne of the reasons ASML gave that 2026 might not be a growth year was uncertainty about tariffs. ASML is based in the Netherlands, so it is a potential target of U.S. tariffs. Management's commentary regarding 2026 was given before the U.S. and European Union reached a trade deal, so this outlook may shift now that a trade deal framework has been reached.\n\nRegardless, management's long-term outlook of revenue between 44 billion euros and 60 billion euros by 2030 hasn't shifted, so whether the growth comes in 2026 or beyond is irrelevant as long as you're patient.\n\nOver the past 12 months, ASML's revenue totaled 32.2 billion euros, so ASML's revenue could come in at the high end of the projection over the next five years. If it does, there's no doubt that ASML will be a market-crushing stock.\n\nIf ASML's revenue comes in on the lower end of that guidance, though, ASML's returns could lag the market's, making it a poor stock pick. Time will tell which of these paths ASML's stock takes, but considering the sheer demand for chips and the stabilization of trade relations, I think it's likely that ASML will come in on the high end of that range, making it an excellent stock to buy today.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:16:29.334932+00:00"}

ASML expects this growth to be driven by both an increase in Low Numerical Aperture (NA) EUV capacity and initial shipments of High NA systems. Moreover, advanced customers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung, and Intel, are expected to add around 30% more EUV capacity compared with 2024, which would further contribute to its revenue growth target.\n\nThe higher productivity NXE:3800E systems, which are now shipping at full specification of 220 wafers per hour configuration, will allow its customers to expand capacity with the same number of systems but at higher average selling prices, resulting in improved margins. In DRAM manufacturing, these systems replace complex multi-patterning deep ultraviolet (DUV) steps with single EUV exposures, reducing cost, shortening cycle times, and improving yields.\n\nAdditionally, demand is being driven by artificial intelligence (AI) applications, which are driving investment in both logic and memory chips. Logic customers are adding leading-edge node capacity, and DRAM customers are adding more EUV layers to their latest and future nodes.\n\nASML has also shipped its first EXE:5200B High NA system, which is designed for high-volume manufacturing and offers about 60% higher productivity than the EXE:5000, and is expected to contribute to the 2025 EUV revenue growth target.\n\nASML faces risks arising from macroeconomic uncertainties, rising geopolitical tensions and tariffs, which could hurt the timing of customer spending. Despite these risks, ASML expects total revenue growth for 2025 to be around 15%, supported by the product mix shift toward advanced logic and DRAM production using advanced EUV lithography systems.

Lam Research is currently the only supplier with atomic layer deposition (ALD) molybdenum tools already in production for foundry, logic and NAND customers.\n\n\n\nMoly is gaining importance as the industry moves below the 2nm node. Below the 2nm nodes, gate-all-around structures face resistance-capacitance (RC) issues with traditional tungsten films. Moly offers lower resistance, and replacing it with tungsten solves this issue. While moly deposition is slower and more complex, it can triple Lam Research’s served available market (SAM) for metal deposition per wafer at these advanced nodes.\n\n\n\nIn NAND, Lam Research’s Halo ALD Moly tools are ramping at multiple NAND customers, with adoption expected to grow as manufacturers move to NAND capacity of more than 200-plus layers. Moreover, in foundry and logic, moly is being used to improve transistor performance for AI-driven designs.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Lam Research secured a key win from another leading foundry for a next-generation application. Lam Research’s multi-station architecture is capable of both plasma and thermal processing in the same chamber, which allows customers to optimize for different applications of future logic devices.\n\n\n\nMoly adoption is one of several drivers, along with advanced packaging, high-bandwidth memory, and NAND layer scaling, that Lam Research expects will expand SAM to the high-30% range of wafer fabrication equipment in the coming years.

Two AI businesses to consider are ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%), since they provide key hardware to the industry.\n\nThe former makes cutting-edge lithography machines, which are necessary for producing the advanced microchips that power AI systems. AMD, one of Nvidia's top competitors, sells AI chips to cloud computing companies such as Microsoft.\n\nASML and AMD are both strong businesses. But determining which is a better AI investment isn't simple. So let's evaluate them in more detail.\n\nA look into ASML\n\nASML's lithography equipment is essential for manufacturing AI microchips because the technology demands immense computing power. This necessitates shrinking chip components to minuscule dimensions. For instance, a microchip the size of your fingernail contains billions of transistors. ASML's machines support this.\n\nAlthough the Dutch company plays an important role in AI, its stock has struggled in 2025, remaining essentially flat through Aug. 6. Part of this is because management anticipates economic uncertainty ahead as a result of factors such as President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nEven so, ASML expects 2025 sales to rise 15% over 2024's 28.3 billion euros ($33 billion). This is significant since 2024's revenue represents only a 2.6% year-over-year increase. And so far this year, the company is doing well.\n\nThrough two quarters, revenue stood at $18 billion, up from the prior year's $13.4 billion. Operating income rose to $5.8 billion from 2024's $3.7 billion. This robust growth resulted in net income of $5.4 billion, a strong increase over the previous year's $3.3 billion.\n\nThe excellent first-half results were tempered by a third-quarter revenue forecast between $8.6 billion and $9.2 billion. This outlook, when compared to the prior year's sales of $8.9 billion, suggests the current trend of strong year-over-year growth may be slowing down, which contributed to ASML's tepid stock performance.\n\nHow AMD is faring\n\nLike rival Nvidia, AMD stock is having a stellar year. Shares are up 35% in 2025 through Aug. 6. This performance is understandable following the company's second-quarter earnings results. The quarter's revenue reached a record $7.7 billion, a 32% year-over-year increase.\n\nCEO Lisa Su said, \"We are seeing robust demand across our computing and AI product portfolio and are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year.\" In that second half, AMD expects revenue of $8.7 billion, a strong increase over the previous year's $6.8 billion.\n\nDespite the sales growth, AMD exited the second quarter with an operating loss of $134 million compared to operating income of $269 million in the previous year. The substantial drop was due to new U.S. government restrictions introduced earlier this year on the sale of AI chips to China. As a result, AMD could not sell chips it had intended for Chinese customers, forcing the company to write off that inventory by $800 million.\n\nYet this makes its second-quarter sales growth all the more impressive. In the quarter, net income was $872 million, up 229% year over year. Consequently, diluted earnings per share soared 238% to $0.54 in a boon to shareholders.\n\nAMD is working to get government approval to sell AI chips to China again. When that OK is obtained, the company is in a position to deliver more outsize sales growth.\n\nDeciding between ASML and AMD\n\nAMD's outstanding performance, its anticipated third-quarter revenue growth, and an eventual return of sales to China point to it being the superior AI stock versus ASML.\n\nHowever, an important consideration is share price valuation. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.\n\nThe top chart shows ASML's P/E ratio has declined over the past year, indicating its stock's valuation has improved. Compared to AMD's recently rising earnings multiple, as seen in the bottom chart, ASML shares look like a bargain.\n\nASML's short-term sales may slow due to the current macroeconomic uncertainty, but over the long run, it's likely to benefit from the rise of AI. The company sees the technology as a significant chance for growth in semiconductors, similar to previous opportunities like PCs, the internet, and smartphones.\n\nIndustry forecasts support ASML's perspective. The AI sector is projected to grow from $244 billion in 2025 to $1 trillion by 2031. While this market growth is a tailwind for both companies, ASML's attractive valuation makes it look like the more compelling AI stock to buy right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:16:39.637421+00:00"}

That raises the possibility of a stock split. While stock splits have become less common in 2025, they can come in bunches. They also stir up interest in a stock, and that could be helpful for the struggling ASML, which is down 18% over the past year.\n\nLet's explore why companies split their stock, review ASML's track record with the practice, and consider whether the stock is worth buying at its current price, with or without a future share split.\n\nWhat's a stock split?\n\nA stock split is a corporate action that increases the number of a company's outstanding shares while reducing the share price proportionally, leaving the overall market capitalization and investor ownership unchanged. For instance, in a 10-for-1 split, one $700 share becomes 10 shares worth $70 each.\n\nAlthough stock splits leave a company's fundamentals untouched, they often improve liquidity and make shares more approachable for retail investors. Despite the growing availability of fractional shares, some brokerages still lack this feature, and steep share prices can remain a psychological barrier for potential buyers. In addition, stock splits offer companies more flexibility when structuring stock-based compensation.\n\nFinally, a high stock price can limit eligibility for price-weighted indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, where share prices directly influence weighting. Companies like ASML, with elevated stock prices, are less likely to be included because they could disproportionately impact the index.\n\nASML has a history of stock splits\n\nASML has executed four stock splits in its history -- three traditional splits and one reverse split. After going public in 1995, ASML carried out 2-for-1 splits in 1997 and 1998, followed by a 3-for-1 split in 2000. In 2007, ASML reversed course with an 8-for-9 reverse split to simplify its capital structure and return cash to shareholders. A similar plan in 2012 resulted in a 77-for-100 reverse split.\n\nFactoring in its past stock splits, an investor who purchased one share of ASML in 1997 would now hold roughly 8.21 shares. However, it's been nearly 20 years since the company last did a traditional stock split, and ASML's share price has climbed significantly. With shares now trading at a high price point, ASML could be a strong candidate for another split, although management hasn't indicated any plans to move in that direction.\n\nDate Event Cumulative Shares March 1995 IPO 1 May 1997 2-for-1 split 2 May 1998 2-for-1 split 4 April 2000 3-for-1 split 12 October 2007 8-for-9 reverse split 10.67 November 2012 77-for-100 reverse split 8.21\n\nData source: Companies Market Cap.\n\nASML's fundamentals are strong\n\nASML sits at the center of one of the world's most critical technology supply chains. It is the only company that produces extreme ultraviolet lithography machines -- tools that enable chipmakers to produce the smallest, most powerful, and most efficient semiconductors available.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, ASML reported 7.7 billion euros ($9 billion) in revenue, a 23% increase compared to the same period last year. Net income rose 45% to 2.3 billion euros ($2.7 billion), highlighting the company's strong profitability despite uncertain trade policies. Perhaps even more impressive is ASML's order backlog, which stood at more than 33 billion euros ($38.5 billion), signaling continued demand from its customers.\n\nManagement reiterated full-year revenue guidance of approximately 32.5 billion euros, or 15% growth compared to 2024. Additionally, it projects gross margin, a key profitability metric, to come in at 52% for 2025, an improvement from 2024's gross margin of 51.4%.\n\nASML prioritizes returning capital to shareholders\n\nBeyond its expanding business, ASML continues to reward shareholders through consistent dividends and stock buybacks. With $4.2 billion in net cash, the company is well positioned to return capital while continuing to invest in future growth.\n\nASML currently pays a quarterly dividend of 1.60 euros, which equates to a 1% annual yield. Since ASML is a Dutch company, U.S. investors hold shares through American depositary receipts, meaning dividend payments fluctuate based on currency exchange rates.\n\nIn addition to the dividend, ASML has steadily reduced its share count, lowering shares outstanding by 6.3% over the past five years. In its most recent quarter, the company spent 1.4 billion euros, or approximately $1.6 billion, on share repurchases, further enhancing long-term shareholder value.\n\nIs ASML a buy, sell, or hold?\n\nStock splits often generate buzz, but they should not be the reason to buy a stock.

It has delivered explosive returns for shareholders this year and is rapidly growing from a business standpoint, too.\n\nThere's nothing to dislike about Palantir's business from an investing standpoint (you may have qualms about what its software is used for in government, but that's beside the point), but there is a lot to dislike about the stock.\n\nAlongside Palantir's rapid rise has been a massive expansion in valuation, and it has become the most expensive stock on the market. I think that this is unsustainable and could lead to some lackluster stock performance over the next few years.\n\nAlthough Palantir has a market cap of over $425 billion, I think ASML (ASML 2.81%) and AMD (AMD 1.52%) could surpass it over the next three years, despite each being worth around $275 billion.\n\nThe case against Palantir\n\nAs mentioned above, Palantir's business is phenomenal. Its software is becoming the building blocks for deploying AI in business and government, and it has the growth to show for it. In the second quarter, Palantir's revenue rose 48% year over year to more than $1 billion. That blew away expectations and showcases the unstoppable demand Palantir is experiencing.\n\nThe problem is that the growth rate is already baked into the stock.\n\nOne of the premier AI stocks over the past few years has been Nvidia. Nvidia posted growth rates of more than 200% during its run, yet never traded for more than 46 times sales or 51 times forward earnings. Palantir has far exceeded those levels despite much slower growth.\n\nLet's break down what growth it would take for Palantir to trade at a reasonable level. If Palantir can sustain a 50% revenue growth rate over the next three years, it would increase its revenue from today's $3.44 billion total to $11.6 billion. If we give Palantir a 30% profit margin (its profit margin was 22% over the past 12 months), that would indicate Palantir would generate $3.5 billion in profits.\n\nAt today's $425 billion market cap, that would still price Palantir's stock at 122 times three-year forward earnings. This showcases how expensive Palantir's stock is, and indicates it could be ripe for a pullback.\n\nAs a result, I think it's possible that ASML and AMD could be larger than Palantir in three years by doing nothing different.\n\nASML and AMD don't have to do anything special to be worth more than Palantir\n\nBoth ASML and AMD are reasonably priced for their current business, and each is expected to put up respectable growth figures over the next few years, although still far slower than Palantir.\n\nUsing Nvidia's max valuation of about 50 times forward earnings as the high point for Palantir's earnings in three years ($3.5 billion), that would indicate the stock should be worth around $175 billion. As mentioned before, Palantir trades at around a $425 billion market cap right now, so this would indicate a substantial drop.\n\nBoth ASML and AMD are valued at around $275 billion, so Palantir's potential drop would cause these two to be worth more.\n\nPalantir is an incredibly overvalued stock, but it has a strong and devoted following, and it may continue to defy traditional valuation metrics, similar to Tesla. Investors are more than capable of holding onto Palantir stock at elevated prices, so the correction to its price may never come, despite all factors indicating that it should.\n\nI still think AMD and ASML will (and should) be valued higher than Palantir's stock, but investors will have to wait and find out if that turns out to be true.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:16:42.679378+00:00"}

One month later, the stock had given back some of those record gains, dropping 13% by the end of July. You can call it profit-taking, or investor nerves, or just a price adjustment. Either way, I think it's high time to buy Netflix stock again.\n\nI'll admit that the stock isn't cheap. Even after July's price correction, Netflix trades at a lofty 49 times earnings. However, the company has earned every penny of that beefy stock price.\n\nRevenue rose 16% year over year in the second quarter. At the same time, the business grew more efficient, and operating margins increased from 27.2% to 24.1%. As a result, bottom-line earnings skyrocketed from $4.88 to $7.19 per diluted share -- a 47% jump. Free cash flow nearly doubled, and the company bought back more shares than it issued.\n\nIt would be one thing if this report were an outlier among several missed swings, but it wasn't. This is how Netflix runs its business nowadays, focusing on profitable growth instead of subscriber additions at any cost.\n\nAnd I don't see any game-changing missteps driving the stock lower in recent weeks. Again, you can call it profit-taking, or you can point to a shaky economy. But the company posted another analyst-stumping earnings report on July 17, and the stock price just kept sliding anyway.\n\nFair enough. Every stock has a fair value, and maybe Netflix investors took this one a little bit too high in the spring. This is a new era for Netflix's business plan that should be good for its investors in the long run. So despite the generous valuation ratios, Netflix stock just might never be this cheap again. It's time to buy Netflix.\n\nTime to bulk up on Costco\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Costco): Investors rarely get the chance to buy Costco stock at a compelling discount, which is why the retailer's July slump is worth a closer look. Shares are roughly flat so far in 2025, trailing the 9% spike in the S&P 500 through late July.\n\nSure, the warehouse giant's growth slowed recently. Comparable-store sales rose 6% in June, down from 8% gains in the past 10 months. But that boost still implies that Costco is seeing strong customer traffic in a competitive industry. Target's comps were negative in the most recent quarter, and Walmart reported a less than 3% uptick back in May.\n\nInvestors will get fresh details on Costco's expansion pace when the company reports July sales trends on Aug. 6. Watch for signs of stabilizing comps in that announcement.\n\nCostco's e-commerce growth has been stellar, too, which should help support higher profits over time. Sales on its website tilt toward expensive consumer discretionary purchases like furniture, jewelry, and electronics, so it's good news for margins when that segment outpaces the wider business. Digital sales are up 16% over the past 10 months, management said in early July. We'll get an update on that figure in early August, too.\n\nIt's true the stock isn't particularly cheap right now. Investors are paying 1.5 times sales for Costco compared to Walmart's valuation of 1.2 times revenue. Yet Costco's premium is down from nearly 2 times sales back in January. That represents a good deal for a company with a long track record of market share growth, stable, subscription-based profits, and excellent cash generation.\n\nIf you've been waiting for a better entry price on this attractive business, this could be the time to push Costco stock up to the top of your watch list.\n\nASML's long-term investment thesis has never been stronger\n\nDaniel Foelber (ASML): There's no sweeter sound to the ears of a long-term investor than when a top stock sells off for near-term factors. That's what's happening to Dutch photolithography semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML. And it's a phenomenal buying opportunity for investors this August.\n\nAt first glance, the semiconductor industry looks like it's on a tear, driven by epic gains in stars like Nvidia and Broadcom. But look closer, and there's a mini sell-off going on in much of the supporting cast.\n\nAnalog and embedded semiconductor supplier Texas Instruments sold off after reporting earnings. So did Arm Holdings, Qualcomm, and ASML. All four companies posted solid earnings, but guidance pointed to a near-term slowdown due to factors such as shifting supply-and-demand dynamics, trade policy, and geopolitical tensions.\n\nIt was a reminder that the semiconductor industry -- although chock-full of multidecade growth prospects -- is highly cyclical and prone to cooling off, even during an evolutionary period in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nASML stands out as my top pick from the sell-off in semiconductor stocks. The company has a virtual monopoly in systems for the printing (or scanning) stage of the semiconductor manufacturing process. This step involves printing circuit designs onto silicon wafers -- creating a highly complex, precise 3D structure. ASML has spent decades developing its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems.\n\nCompared to the older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems, EUV can reduce costs for ASML's customers (chip fabs) and help them fulfill more complex orders faster by using wavelengths that are 14 times shorter than DUV light, reducing the number of process steps. The shorter wavelength allows chipmakers to pack more transistors per chip, which boosts their capabilities.\n\nOn its latest earnings call, ASML said it could not confirm growth for next year due to an uncertain geopolitical climate and macro concerns. The company's supply chain is sensitive to tariffs, and it has major customers in Taiwan, South Korea, and China -- making it vulnerable to trade policy. So I would expect ASML's stock price to react to trade-related news. However, management confirmed the company's 2030 targets due to explosive demand for its higher-margin EUV machines.\n\nAll told, ASML stands out as a compelling investment opportunity for folks with at least a five-year time horizon. The stock price could do just about anything in the near term, but the company is at the top of its game. It's the most exciting time ever to invest in ASML, but the market is too caught up in what could happen next quarter, so it's missing the big picture.\n\nPlay it safe with this monster dividend stock\n\nNeha Chamaria (Enterprise Products Partners): With the S&P 500 trading at historically high valuations, the Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner recommends dividend and value plays for a defensive stance now. I'm all for defensive dividend stocks now, especially companies backing their yields with steadily growing cash flows and payout.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners is one such stock that belongs in your portfolio. Shares of the oil and gas pipeline company yield a hefty 7%, and management has increased the dividend for 27 consecutive years. That's not even the best part.\n\nEnterprise Products' cash flows have comfortably covered dividends over the years. In fiscal 2024, for example, it generated record distributable cash flow (DCF) of $7.8 billion, providing 1.7 times coverage of the dividends declared for the year. That DCF coverage makes Enterprise Products' dividends very safe.\n\nAs it is, Enterprise Products' dividend is highly bankable because of the recession-proof nature of its business. Midstream energy infrastructure companies provide services like storage, processing, and distribution under long-term contracts with little exposure to oil and gas prices. What's more, the bulk of these contracts also have inflation escalation clauses to mitigate the impact of inflation on cash flows.\n\nBut here's the biggest reason why this defensive dividend stock is a solid buy now. Enterprise Products is bringing projects worth nearly $6 billion online this year, so management expects free cash flows to \"take a step up\" in 2026 and 2027. Read that as bigger dividends -- the bigger the company's cash flows, the bigger the dividends it can pay to its shareholders.\n\nA great growth stock for nervous investors\n\nKeith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): I'll readily admit to being something of a \"nervous Nellie\" right now. The stock market is near all-time highs. The Buffett indicator (the ratio of total U.S. stock market capitalization to GDP) is above a level that Warren Buffett has referred to as \"playing with fire.\" I suspect that many are underestimating the negative impact on consumer spending and the U.S. economy that the full brunt of tariffs will have.\n\nBut I think that Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a great growth stock to buy in August for nervous investors like me. This biotech stock is cheap if you factor in its growth prospects. Vertex's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which uses analysts' five-year earnings growth projections, is a super-low 0.58, according to LSEG.\n\nThere are no worries about a consumer spending decline or economic downturn hurting Vertex's business. The company markets the only approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). These CF drugs generate more than 90% of Vertex's revenue.\n\nMy main reason for excitement about Vertex, though, is its new products and promising pipeline candidates. The drugmaker launched Journavx earlier this year. It's the first new class of pain medication in over 20 years. I expect the non-opioid pain drug will be a smashing commercial success.\n\nVertex could have additional winners in the not-too-distant future. The company is evaluating inaxaplin in a late-stage clinical study for treating APOL1-mediated kidney disease. Povetacicept is another late-stage program targeting chronic kidney disease IgA nephropathy. Zimislecel advanced to pivotal testing after encouraging results in earlier clinical trials as a one-time treatment (i.e., cure) for severe type 1 diabetes. All three of these targeting indications have patient populations larger than CF.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:16:46.067785+00:00"}

Many stocks are flat or even down year to date (YTD). Starting to invest while the market is at all-time highs may seem foolish, but if you avoid high-flying stocks with premium valuations, there are plenty of cheap-looking companies you can buy right now.\n\nTwo bargain buys for 2025 and beyond are ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%), two technology stocks with long growth runways that are trading at cheap valuations. With just $1,000, you can invest in these stocks and watch your wealth appreciate over the long haul. Here's why.\n\nASML's industry dominance\n\nEven though artificial intelligence (AI) has propelled some industry stocks to all-time highs this year, semiconductor equipment maker ASML is in the gutter. The stock is flat YTD and off 37% from all-time highs. Why is the stock falling when spending on semiconductors and computer chips is projected to keep growing to keep up with AI demand? Because of uncertainty around 2026 revenue due to tariffs.\n\nASML is based in the Netherlands and assembles vast lithography machines that help print tiny designs onto computer chips. These machines are assembled with parts from around the globe and sold into the United States, Taiwan, China, and more. Increased tariff taxes -- especially on machines sold into the United States -- may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay or halt orders of new lithography machines.\n\nThis could hurt ASML's business in 2026. However, in the long run, the company is positioned to benefit from the growing need for advanced computer chips. No company has been able to replicate ASML's advanced lithography technologies, which are required to build advanced computer chips. This means that manufacturers are forced to go to ASML for these machines, which they will need eventually to build these advanced chips, giving ASML pricing power. A new machine is reportedly going for $400 million when sold to customers.\n\nA strong competitive position gives ASML management confidence in making long-term guidance. By 2030, the company expects to hit between 44 billion and 60 billion euros in revenue, compared to 30 billion euros over the last 12 months. The guidance includes profit margin expansion, which has been a consistent theme for ASML due to its strong pricing power.\n\nToday, ASML stock trades at a below-market earnings multiple, with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 25.4. With strong pricing power and good long-term demand for its end markets, ASML is a bargain stock to buy at a price of $700 if you are patient enough to hold for many years into the future.\n\nAlphabet's impressive growth\n\nAnother stock with a beaten down P/E is Alphabet, which owns Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud. Some are speculating that the company will be a loser in AI, even though it keeps putting up impressive financial growth and is proving to be an AI winner.\n\nOn the consumer and individual front, AI is helping Alphabet expand the moneymaking potential of Google Search. Revenue for the division grew 12% year over year last quarter to $54 billion. On top of this, Alphabet's subscription and devices revenue grew 20% year over year to $11.2 billion. This is the segment that houses the Gemini AI chatbot, the advanced conversational AI tool that Alphabet developed and that now has hundreds of millions of users.\n\nLet's not forget the commercial side of things, which is perhaps the biggest bright spot for Alphabet at the moment. Google Cloud grew revenue 32% to $13.6 billion and is turning into another way for Alphabet to monetize its AI infrastructure. With profit margins expanding to 21%, Google Cloud is turning into a real earnings growth driver for the company. It is one of the top places to host for AI-focused cloud computing. It has a huge market share among AI start-ups, which will help the division grow for many years into the future.\n\nAlphabet's business is booming, but look at the P/E ratio and you'd think it was left for dead. The P/E is now at 21, which is significantly lower than its big technology peers' and most other AI companies'. This makes Alphabet an easy bargain buy for your portfolio at today's stock price of $200.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:16:47.587045+00:00"}

Tech companies have reported earnings recently, and they still remain committed to investing heavily in AI, in an effort to grow their businesses and take advantage of next-gen technologies.\n\nYou might be tempted to invest in leading AI chipmaker Nvidia and other highly valued stocks to capitalize on these growth opportunities, but there may potentially be a better, more underrated option available. One stock that's been sliding over the past year but that is critical in AI chip development is ASML (ASML 2.81%). It may be one of the best buys out there right now.\n\nASML's key role in chipmaking\n\nDutch-based ASML makes photolithography machines. They are integral in chipmaking because they are necessary to etch patterns on silicon wafers. The company doesn't have any direct competition for its extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which are used in creating the most advanced chips. The sophisticated machines give the business a strong competitive moat, which can put ASML in a great position to benefit from strong and continued demand in the AI chip market.\n\nIn the company's most recent quarter, which ended on June 29, ASML reported net sales totaling 7.7 billion euros ($8.9 billion), which rose 23% year over year. Net income totaling 2.3 billion euros ($2.7 billion) increased by more than 45%.\n\nFor the full year, the company is projecting 15% revenue growth and for its gross profit margin to be around 52%. ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet, however, remains cautious about the following year. \"Looking at 2026, we see that our AI customers' fundamentals remain strong. At the same time, we continue to see increasing uncertainty driven by macro-economic and geopolitical developments.\"\n\nThat uncertainty may be a reason why investors haven't been all that eager to buy the AI stock this year.\n\nThe stock is trading well below normal levels\n\nOver the past 12 months, shares of ASML are down 15%. The stock has been underperforming the market this year and it's trading at a modest price-to-earnings multiple of just 25 -- that's right in line with the S&P 500 average. Investors, however, are often paying far higher multiples for big players in AI. Nvidia, for instance, trades at nearly 60 times earnings.\n\nTariffs and global economic uncertainty may be the biggest factors that are weighing down ASML's stock of late. If the company were based in the U.S., I think its valuation would likely be far higher than it is right now. But that certainly isn't a reason to shy away from it.\n\nAccording to the consensus analyst price target of nearly $924, the stock could have near-term upside of more than 33%. In the long run, it may rise even higher given the persistent demand for cutting-edge chips.\n\nIs ASML a no-brainer buy right now?\n\nASML is a stock that looks like a fantastic buy, perhaps even a no-brainer investment at this point.

Furthermore, all the leading DRAM memory producers are just now adopting EUV, and DRAM demand is exploding because of the memory needs of AI systems.\n\nOf course, ASML has been known to have this monopoly for a while and entered the past five years at a higher valuation than peers. Yet the stock's underperformance has changed that, and shares now look like somewhat of a bargain, at least by growth stock standards.\n\nASML is at a decade-long discount\n\nAfter its recent post-earnings selloff, ASML now trades at roughly 25 times earnings. That valuation doesn't scream \"cheap\" on the surface. But again, ASML is an extraordinary company, and that valuation is the cheapest it has been over the past 10 years, with a few exceptions.\n\nMuch of the recent selloff has to do with near-term concerns over the 2026 growth outlook. On ASML's recent earnings release, management said that while the company is still preparing for a growth year next year, it wasn't guaranteeing it. That was a change from last quarter, when ASML said it was expecting a growth year in 2026, after a strong midteens growth expectation this year.\n\nManagement spoke of the overhang of tariffs, which could have both direct and indirect impacts. Tariffs may directly slow the several of ASML's end markets, as those end products are still mostly assembled in East Asia. There is also the question of Section 232 tariffs on semiconductors, which have not yet been announced. Should semiconductors get tariffed specifcally, many important chips could be directly affected, given the importance of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) in the electronics supply chain.\n\nThere are also indirect impacts on the wider economy, which could also depress overall demand. Although chips tend to have la strong long-term growth outlook, it's still a very cyclical business at times. Last Friday, we perhaps saw the first signs of tariffs' impacts on the economy, as job creation for July came in well below target, while the stronger readings from May and June were also revised down.\n\nThe big innovation in chips today doesn't have to do with lithography\n\nAnother part of ASML's valuation compression may have to do with the technology of chipmaking itself.\n\nMajor chipmakers are now switching from finFET transistors, with the gate surrounding three sides of the transistor source, to gate-all-around transistors, in which the gate encircles the source on all four sides. This architecture also allows transistor sources to be stacked on top of each other in vertical fashion.\n\nIn addition, another innovation going on right now is backside power, in which the power controls of the chip are being built on the back side of the silicon and connected through the silicon surface to the front. This frees up more space on the front of the chip, allowing greater transistor counts and performance.\n\nLithography, which is what ASML does, has to do with shrinking transistors down to smaller and smaller sizes so that more can fit on a given piece of silicon. However, the enabling technologies of GAA and backside power have more to do with other areas of manufacturing technology, such as etch and deposition, novel packaging and wafer thinning, and increased metrology.\n\nThis could be why other major semicap equipment stocks in etch, deposition, and metrology have seen their valuations go up, as ASML's valuation has come back down toward them:\n\nBut near-termism has created an opportunity\n\nWhile the picture for 2026 and maybe the next couple of years are a bit murky for ASML, the long-term growth opportunity appears intact, as does ASML's competitive advantage in lithography.\n\nCountering the worries about a near-term slowdown in lithography intensity, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet noted:\n\nSo I think that after the 1.4 nanometer node, we will see again some litho intensity increase some more EUV layers. If you look at the long term also there, the Logic customers are extremely bullish about the need for more EUV layers. So yes, there is one node as it happened before with FinFET, where there's a bit of a pause. But I always explain the only reason for that pause is to enable more shrink moving forward. So for every node where you pause basically to change your transistor architecture, usually, you will see 3, 4, 5 nodes where you continue basically to shrink and there drive more litho intensity.\n\nBasically, the 2nm node may not see an increase in litho intensity as chipmakers focus on getting the new transistor and backside power right, but lithography intensity and shrink should still continue beyond that point into the future. On that note, ASML kept its 2030 revenue range outlook between 44 billion to 60 billion euros intact. That's relative to the 32.2 billion euros ASML has made over the past 12 months.\n\nIn that scenario, ASML should be making between 14 billion and 23 billion euros in net profit by 2030, relative to its 230 billion Euro market cap today.\n\nGiven ASML's technology moat and the strong long-term picture for advanced semiconductors and memory, that a seems like a very solid value for investors looking beyond the next year.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:16:54.673561+00:00"}

This cutting-edge technology is essential for manufacturing the smallest and most advanced chips used in AI accelerators, high-performance computing and smartphones. Demand for EUV systems remains robust, with top customers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung and Intel investing heavily in advanced node development.\n\nFinancially, ASML Holding is performing well. In the second quarter of 2025, it reported revenue growth of 23% and a 47% jump in earnings per share. Despite strong quarterly results, management’s commentary about next year’s forecasts raises concerns about its growth prospects.\n\nOn the second-quarter earnings call, management backed away from earlier confidence about growth in 2026. Previously, ASML Holding had expected demand to keep rising, especially with AI fueling more chip production. However, on the second-quarter call, the company said that it “cannot confirm growth in 2026,” pointing to customer hesitation and ongoing market uncertainty.\n\nDuring the call, ASML Holding acknowledged that ongoing U.S.-China tariff discussions, including the Section 232 tariff review, are negatively impacting customer capital spending timelines. This hesitation may delay orders and revenue recognition in late 2025 and into 2026, casting doubt on near-term growth continuity. Analysts are also pessimistic about the company’s prospects in 2026, as reflected by the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAdditionally, ASML Holding issued disappointing guidance for the third quarter.

It's a crucial time for investors. There have been virtually no signs of artificial intelligence (AI) losing its momentum. While it's still early, some of the leading AI stocks have already reported outstanding results that solidify their prolific roles in AI's coming of age.\n\nThese three AI stocks have delivered impressive earnings results and still trade at compelling valuations, making them no-brainer buys right now.\n\n1. ASML\n\nDutch company ASML Holdling (ASML 2.81%) builds complex equipment systems that are crucial to manufacturing the high-end chips used in AI. As one might guess in this ongoing AI boom, the company reported stellar earnings results for the second quarter of 2025, surpassing Wall Street estimates in both sales and earnings. Yet, the stock has veered lower and now sits nearly 40% below its all-time high. So what's going on?\n\nASML's management issued very cautious guidance for next year, citing uncertainty related to tariffs and geopolitical trade tensions (export controls) that could potentially threaten ASML's ability to grow its business. But here's the thing: ASML is the only company in the world that produces extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which use highly concentrated UV light to etch patterns onto silicon.\n\nIf the world needs more and increasingly complex chips, that demand should trickle to ASML over time. That could be why analysts still anticipate ASML growing earnings by an average of over 17% annually for the next three to five years, even if management is erring to the side of caution for right now.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25 is a five-year low. In other words, ASML, a mission-critical player in AI infrastructure, is the cheapest it's been since the AI boom started.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%), continues to slump on concerns that AI models will continue to grow and eventually pressure Google's search engine advertising profits. While ChatGPT continues to swell in popularity, Google is doing just fine. Alphabet's Google ad revenue grew by an impressive 12% year over year in the second quarter. For now, at least, it appears that ChatGPT and Google can coexist profitably.\n\nThe stock isn't even down much, just 8% below its all-time high. Yet, it feels like Wall Street just isn't respecting the tech giant enough; shares trade at a P/E ratio of only 20, versus an average of nearly 30 over the past decade.\n\nInvestors who buy here have much to be excited about, and it spans well beyond the search engine business. Alphabet's Google Cloud is rapidly growing due to AI tailwinds, and the company's Waymo subsidiary is establishing itself as the leader in the autonomous driving space, as its ride-hailing service continues to expand into new markets.\n\nIn all, analysts have Alphabet slotted for nearly 15% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years, making the stock a bargain at just 20 times earnings today. Alphabet could outperform the market on growth alone moving forward, and could be a genuine game changer for your portfolio if sentiment improves and boosts the stock's valuation closer to its long-term norms.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nGlobal foundry behemoth Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) -- also known as TSMC --is the world's leading producer of semiconductors, and it continues to cement its status as a leading AI company and juggernaut in the broader tech space. Companies like Nvidia turn to TSMC to manufacture their AI chips, which has helped the company expand its market share to an estimated 35.3% in Q1 2025, up from 29.4% just a year ago.\n\nTSMC's AI momentum helped the company turn in a blowout second quarter. Research by McKinsey & Company estimates that companies will continue to invest in data centers over the coming years, with worldwide estimates projected to exceed $7 trillion over the next five years alone. All those data centers will need vast quantities of chips, which should keep TSM busy for the foreseeable future. Analysts estimate TSMC will grow earnings by an average of over 21% annually for the next three to five years.\n\nThe caveat with this stock is the geopolitical risk associated with TSMC's location in Taiwan, which has a long-standing dispute with China over the land's sovereignty. While an escalation of those tensions could impact TSMC's business, it's becoming hard to ignore the value here. The stock's P/E ratio is just 27, a bargain for the growth that investors anticipate from TSM moving forward. This makes Taiwan Semiconductor a strong buy for anyone comfortable with the geopolitical risks.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:16:58.568690+00:00"}

We believe this momentum is grounded in strong fundamentals, and TSM’s long-term outlook justifies a hold position for now.\n\nAI Boom: A Multi-Year Growth Catalyst for TSM\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor continues to dominate the semiconductor foundry space. TSMC is known for its advanced production capabilities and has already moved into 3nm production, with 2nm coming soon. Its large scale allows it to handle rising AI chip demand better than most competitors. The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom has placed TSMC at the center of a multi-year structural growth cycle.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has established itself as the preferred manufacturing partner for AI accelerators, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom silicon developed by major players like NVIDIA, Marvell Technology and Broadcom.\n\nIn 2024, AI-related revenues tripled, making up a mid-teen percentage of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s total revenues, and the momentum is far from over. TSMC expects AI-related sales to double again in 2025, with an impressive 40% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. This positions TSM as the undisputed backbone of AI-driven technological advancements.\n\nTo capitalize on the AI-driven growing demand for advanced chips, Taiwan Semiconductor is investing heavily in expanding production capabilities. The company is set to invest between $38 billion and $42 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, far outpacing its $29.8 billion investment in 2024. The bulk of this spending, around 70%, is focused on advanced manufacturing processes, ensuring TSM stays ahead of other chip manufacturing rivals.\n\nTSMC’s Resilient Financial Performance\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s latest earnings report highlights just how dominant the company remains. In the second quarter of 2025, TSM’s revenues surged 44% year over year to $30.07 billion, while EPS jumped 61% to $2.47. This growth was powered by the booming demand for its advanced 3nm and 5nm nodes, which now account for 58% of total wafer sales.

It's the top producer of lithography systems, which optically etch patterns onto silicon wafers, and it serves all of the largest chip foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung and Intel.\n\nASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems are used to produce older and larger chips. It's also the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are used to produce the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips in the world.\n\nASML's monopolization of that technology makes it a linchpin of the semiconductor market. From 2014 to 2024, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 17%, its gross margin expanded from 44.3% to 51.3%, and its EPS rose at a CAGR of 22%. Over the past 10 years, its stock has rallied 610% and delivered a total return of 684% with its dividends.\n\nASML still seems like a sound long-term investment, but it's pulled back more than 30% from its record closing price of $1,085.93 per share last July. Let's see why its stock cooled off -- and if that pullback represents a compelling buying opportunity for patient investors.\n\nWhat happened to ASML over the past year?\n\nASML's net sales rose 14% in 2022 and 30% in 2023. That acceleration was driven by its rising shipments of DUV and EUV systems, the explosive growth of the AI market, stable service and upgrade revenue, and the gradual rollout of its newest high-NA EUV systems -- which are required to mass produce even smaller and denser chips (below the 2nm node) than its current low-NA EUV systems. ASML is barred from shipping its EUV systems to China, but it's still selling plenty of older DUV systems to Chinese chipmakers.\n\nBut in 2024, ASML's net sales only rose 3%, its gross margin stayed flat, and its EPS dipped 3%. Its growth cooled off as it lapped the AI market's initial growth spurt, its non-AI markets grew at a slower clip, and it was restricted from shipping some of its higher-end DUV systems to China. Its top customers also reined in their system upgrades.\n\nMetric Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Net Sales Growth (YOY) (9.5%) 11.9% 28% 46.4% 23.2% Bookings Growth (YOY) 23.7% 1.2% (22.8%) 9% (0.5%) Gross Margin 51.5% 50.8% 51.7% 54% 53.7% EPS Growth (YOY) (18.7%) 9.8% 31.5% 92.9% 47.1%\n\nBut in the first half of 2025, ASML's net sales rose by the double digits again as its gross margins expanded. That recovery was driven by AI tailwinds for the DRAM memory chip market, which offset a lot of the pressure from the unpredictable tariffs and tighter export curbs against China, and more upgrades to its high-NA EUV systems.\n\nFor the full year, ASML expects its net sales to rise 15% as its gross margin expands by nearly a percentage point to 52%. Analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow 14% and 24%, respectively. From 2024 to 2027, they expect its revenue and EPS to increase at a CAGR of 10% and 17%, respectively.\n\nWe should take those long-term estimates with a grain of salt, but ASML should dominate the crucial EUV market for the foreseeable future. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 25 times next year's earnings, it pays a forward dividend yield of 1%, and it will remain one of the most straightforward ways to invest in the secular expansion of the semiconductor market.\n\nTherefore, I think it's a great idea to accumulate more shares of ASML this year as the bulls look the other way.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:17:08.135547+00:00"}

If you're looking to increase your AI exposure, then taking a look at these four is a great idea.\n\nAt the top of my list for best AI stocks to buy in August are Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%), Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%), and ASML (ASML 2.81%). These four have a great combination of growth and value.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has been the top stock of AI investing for a reason: Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the nearly universal computing equipment for training and running AI workloads. The demand for Nvidia GPUs is still quite strong, and it could get another growth catalyst in the near future.\n\nBack in April, the U.S. government revoked Nvidia's license to export to China the H20 chips that it had specifically designed to meet export restrictions. This was a huge blow to Nvidia's business, with Nvidia losing out on $8 billion in projected revenue from the $45 billion it had expected to generate.\n\nFortunately, Nvidia has reapplied for its export license and says it has assurances from the government that it will be approved. While this won't affect Q2 results (which Nvidia will report in late August), a restart of H20 sales to China should boost growth for the remainder of the year. This will give Nvidia's stock a strong boost, making it a smart stock to buy in August.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest chip foundry, and makes chips for companies like Nvidia that lack the capabilities to do it themselves. TSMC is winning business from other foundries, making it the clear leader in this space.\n\nIt has already reported Q2 results, which delivered impressive 44% year-over-year revenue growth in U.S. dollars. However, that's just the beginning.\n\nManagement expects that for the five-year period starting in 2025, it will deliver nearly a 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for revenue. With TSMC's stock trading at 25 times forward earnings, it's not that expensive right now.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet recently reported impressive earnings, with revenue rising 14% year over year and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rising 22%. Normally, that would cause a big tech company to be assigned a forward earnings multiple in the high 20s to the low 30s, but Alphabet doesn't receive the same respect as other big tech companies.\n\nIt trades for less than 20 times forward earnings, making it cheaper than the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.13%), which trades at 24 times forward earnings.\n\nThis cheap price tag is assigned to Alphabet's stock because investors are worried about Google Search losing market share to generative AI products. However, that hasn't surfaced. Google has integrated AI search overviews, which bridge the gap between a full generative AI experience and traditional search. Management stated that over 2 billion people have used this and that it has the same monetization as a traditional search.\n\nThere have been no signs of weakness with Google Search, as revenue rose 12% year over year in the recent quarter. This indicates that Alphabet is cheap for no solid reason, which makes it a great buy for August.\n\n4. ASML\n\nASML is probably the least known company on this list, but it may be the most important. ASML has a technological monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which chip fabricators (like Taiwan Semiconductor) use to lay the microscopic electrical traces on chips. Without ASML's machines, none of the AI tech we enjoy today would be possible.\n\nAs chip demand rises, so will demand for ASML machines. While management was a bit bearish on its 2026 outlook thanks to tariff concerns, the long-term trend is still positive for ASML, as it's clear that chip demand is increasing.\n\nASML is still slated to deliver strong growth over the next few years, and its fairly cheap 26 times earnings estimates price tag looks like a steal considering its dominant market position.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:17:12.027346+00:00"}

The company's apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, continue to add users. Meta's daily active users increased by 6% year over year to a whopping 3.48 billion in Q2 2025.\n\nAt the same time, ad pricing grew by 9% year over year. As a result, Meta Platforms enjoyed 22% year-over-year revenue growth, and the company's net income surged by 36% versus the same quarter a year ago.\n\nThis strength continues to show how vital artificial intelligence can be for Meta Platforms. On the one hand, it can utilize AI to automate aspects of its core advertising business and boost efficiency and profitability -- Meta's operating margin surged 5 percentage points from a year ago. On the other hand, AI represents a new frontier beyond smartphones, marked by Meta's expansion and investments in smart glasses.\n\nMeta recently traded at 27 times 2025 earnings estimates, and analysts expected it to grow by an average of over 16% annually over the next three to five years. However, Wall Street may need to quickly adjust its estimates to account for Meta's building momentum, which speaks volumes about what the company is capable of moving forward.\n\nMeta Platforms continues to raise the bar, which makes the stock a table-pounding buy as investors try to figure out just what its ceiling might be in this emerging golden age of AI.\n\nTemporary headwinds could be a buying opportunity in this chip manufacturer\n\nWill Healy (ASML): One AI stock that could finish strong in 2025 is ASML. It's not a household name, but it plays a critical role in AI.\n\nASML leads the industry in extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), the technology needed to make the world's most advanced chips. However, despite growing demand for AI-driven technology, it has experienced some significant headwinds.\n\nIn recent months, companies like Intel have delayed or canceled foundry construction projects. ASML's market niche leaves it with only a small number of customers, so delays or lost customers will likely impact its financials significantly.\n\nMoreover, China-based Huawei has improved its EUV technology. That poses a possible competitive threat to an industry that ASML has dominated.\n\nHowever, Grand View Research expects the global AI market to reach a size of $1.8 trillion by 2030, amounting to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% in that time! That will almost certainly increase the demand for AI chips, meaning the market will need more EUV machines from ASML.\n\nASML's recent financial performance reflects that CAGR. It reported net sales of 15.4 billion euros ($17.8 billion) in the first half of 2025, a 34% yearly increase. The company also kept expense growth in check -- net income of over 4.6 billion euros ($5.4 billion) surged 66% higher over the same period.\n\nStill, analysts expect slowdowns to soon affect ASML's financials. Revenue projections for Q3 call for net sales between 7.4 billion and 7.9 billion euros, which would amount to just a 2% increase at the midpoint. Analysts projections confirm a slowdown is coming with 2025 revenue expected to slow to 14%. That deceleration has weighed on results, and the stock is down by nearly 20% over the last year.\n\nNonetheless, investors may be overlooking ASML's 26 earnings multiple, an unusually low level since its five-year average P/E ratio is 42. As more investors notice the discounted valuation and take its long-term growth prospects into account, it could attract bargain hunters, setting the stock up for a comeback.\n\nAlphabet's cloud services business is on fire\n\nJake Lerch (Alphabet): My choice is Alphabet.\n\nWhen Alphabet reported its second-quarter earnings results (for the three months ending on June 30, 2025) a couple of weeks ago, two items stood out to me.\n\nFirst off, the company reported year-over-year revenue growth of 14%, beating most analyst expectations. That's important because there has been a sense among analysts that the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution could really hurt Alphabet's golden goose: its Google Search business.\n\nThe theory is that Google Search usage will drop off as more people turn to ChatGPT and other AI-powered chatbots for answers. In turn, Google's ad rates will drop, and Alphabet's revenue growth will suffer.\n\nIt could happen -- but it isn't happening yet. In fact, ad revenue increased by about 10%. In other words, Google Search is doing just fine.\n\nSecond, Alphabet reported that its cloud services business is red-hot. Google Cloud -- the third-largest cloud services provider behind Amazon and Microsoft -- reported revenue growth of 32%. Crucially, Alphabet's management chalked up the excellent performance to the AI boom. Ironically, one of the customers that has recently signed up to use Google Cloud is none other than OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nSo, with its ad business performing decently and its cloud business performing nicely, all is well with Alphabet. And the company has other irons in the fire. Its Waymo subsidiary is one of the first companies bringing autonomous vehicles to the public, and its Quantum AI lab remains hard at work trying to revolutionize the very nature of computing.\n\nAlphabet's near-term and long-term prospects continue to look bright. Investors looking for an AI stock that could perform well in 2025 and beyond should consider it now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:17:15.885674+00:00"}

The benchmark S&P 500 index is currently up 8.6% so far (as of July 28).\n\nAmid this technology-driven rally, two leading AI stocks continue to be dominant presences in their respective niches. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (TSM 0.77%) shares are up 23.2%, while shares of ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) are up 3.9% so far in 2025.\n\nYou don't need boatloads of funds to pick a stake in these market-leading stocks. If you have $1,000 that you don't need to pay bills or for contingencies, investing in either of these stocks can prove to be a genius move in the long run. Here's why.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nThe complete dominance of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in advanced chip manufacturing, accounting for over 90% of AI chip manufacturing, has positioned it as the backbone of the global AI infrastructure. The company also accounted for 67.6% of the pure-play foundry market in the first quarter of 2025, significantly higher than the 7.7% share of the second-largest player, Samsung Foundry.\n\nTSMC manufactures semiconductor chips for virtually every major technology company, including Nvidia, Apple, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom. In fact, according to data from Boston Consulting Group, cited by J.P. Morgan, the U.S. purchases 92% of its advanced AI chips from the company.\n\nTSMC's prowess in advanced process nodes (chip manufacturing technology) has created a competitive advantage. The company's advanced process node technology enables it to mass-produce cutting-edge, smaller, and more powerful chips for AI use cases. Additionally, the company has announced plans to invest $165 billion in advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. This move is expected to help reduce over-reliance and geographic risks, as most of its manufacturing is currently concentrated in Taiwan.\n\nTSMC has also reported strong financial results for the second quarter. Revenue increased 44% year over year to $30 billion, mainly driven by strong demand for its 3 nanometer (nm) and 5nm node semiconductor chips in AI and high-performance computing applications. The company's non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) also increased by 67% to $1.48. Management now expects the company's 2025 revenue to increase by 30%.\n\nTSMC currently trades at a reasonable 23.5 times forward earnings. That looks particularly attractive considering that management guided for AI-related revenues to increase at a mid-40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years at the start of 2025. Hence, investors should consider buying a small stake in this high-growth stock now.\n\nASML Holding\n\nASML is one of the key technology companies driving the ongoing AI revolution. The company develops lithography equipment for semiconductor manufacturers, including TSMC, Intel, and Samsung Foundry, which enables them to manufacture the advanced semiconductors that are essential for high-performance computing and AI applications.\n\nASML's business spans two segments: Net System Sales, including Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) machines and Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) machines, and Installed Base Management, which involves services offered for the maintenance, upgrade, and security of ASML's installed systems.\n\nThe company's EUV platform is the preferred technology used worldwide to manufacture advanced chips (7nm and below). The company holds a near monopoly in EUV lithography and is the sole manufacturer of EUV systems globally. EUV systems use extreme ultraviolet light with a wavelength of just 13.5 nanometers, combined with mirrors, to print much smaller patterns required for advanced AI chips.\n\nUndoubtedly, EUV technology is more expensive for clients, but it has resulted in improved precision and fewer production steps in chip manufacturing compared to older methods.\n\nWhile EUV receives the most attention, the company's deep UV (DUV) systems remain a significant part of ASML's sales. DUV systems use deep ultraviolet light at wavelengths such as 157 nanometers, 193 nanometers, and 248 nanometers through lenses to print patterns on chips.\n\nASML reported strong Q2 financial results. Revenue totaled 7.69 billion euros ($8.9 billion), of which 2.3 billion euros ($2.66 billion) were EUV sales. While net system sales totaled 5.5 billion euros ($6.37 billion), installed base services generated 2.1 billion euros ($2.43 billion) in revenue. ASML is also profitable, generating 2.3 billion euros ($2.66 billion) in the second quarter.\n\nManagement now expects total net sales to increase by approximately 15%, with gross margin of 52% in 2025. This guidance seems achievable, considering the company had a 33-billion-euro backlog at the end of Q2. ASML is also committed to returning capital to shareholders, as evident from its aggressive share repurchases worth 5.8 billion euros in the first half of 2025.\n\nDespite the technological moat and robust financials, ASML trades at a reasonable 28.7 times forward earnings. That looks particularly attractive for a company whose earnings are forecast to increase by 24.4% in 2025.\n\nASML has pulled back almost 34% from its all-time high in early July 2025, due to growth uncertainties for 2026 stemming from macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. However, considering the company's monopoly in EUV technology and the accelerating AI-driven demand for advanced chips, investors should view this dip as an excellent entry point for buying shares.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:17:17.355792+00:00"}

While Intel remains committed to 18A—which will support its next three generations of products—canceling development of the next node, 14A, would mark a major twist. According to Bernstein analysts, the consequences for the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market would be significant, particularly for suppliers tied to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Intel accounts for 20–25% of logic foundry capex and 10–15% of total semiconductor capex. Lasertec Corp (TYO:6920) and ASML (AS:ASML) are among the most exposed, with Lasertec deriving an estimated 28% of revenue from Intel and ASML about 9%. “It is especially negative to Lasertec as Intel contributes a bigger part of its backlog,” analysts led by David Dai wrote, estimating about 40% exposure. High NA EUV adoption could also be delayed, as Intel was expected to be the first mover in that space. For materials suppliers, the benefits would skew toward TSMC’s (NYSE:TSM) ecosystem. Hoya, the sole EUV mask blank supplier to TSMC, could theoretically expand its market share to 100% if Intel exits manufacturing and AGC loses its role as Intel’s supplier. “Ibiden also has sizeable exposure to Intel but should be immune, assuming Intel continues advancing its backend packaging technology,” the analysts added. On the foundry side, TSMC stands to gain the most, with Samsung Foundry also well-positioned. “TSMC clearly will benefit if Intel turns fabless,” the team noted. They also added that Samsung (KS:005930) could emerge as a strategic alternative in leading-edge logic manufacturing. As for Intel, Bernstein sees a degree of desperation behind the announcement. “One semi-plausible thesis around this is that it is a cry for help to the administration coupled with a veiled threat,” the analysts said. Furthermore, they cautioned that Intel’s announcement could hurt its ability to attract major customers, especially if those customers begin to doubt the company’s long-term commitment to manufacturing. Ultimately, the decision, “while potentially necessary for Intel’s longer survival in some form, creates substantial disruption and uncertainty around both the business and the stock which it seems prudent to avoid,” Bernstein concluded. Intel shares dropped 8% on Friday after the company signaled a possible exit from chip manufacturing. CEO Lip-Bu Tan also announced plans to cut more jobs, halt construction on two planned facilities in Europe, and slow progress on a third in Ohio, effectively abandoning his predecessor’s strategy of investing heavily in new plants to regain manufacturing leadership.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:17:19.420465+00:00"}

Companies with strong exposure to the artificial intelligence boom saw their stocks surge on optimistic forecasts.

The major indexes continue to pull further and further away from their April lows as many mega-cap growth stocks rocket to new heights. However, not all tech stocks are riding the wave.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN 5.01%), commonly known as TI, and ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) -- two semiconductor companies in the tech sector -- underwent significant sell-offs after their latest earnings reports. TI fell 13.9% from when it reported earnings on July 22 through July 25, while ASML is down 13.6% since reporting earnings on July 16.\n\nHere's why TI and ASML have taken a hit and what it could mean for other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nWarning bells of a near-term slowdown\n\nTI reported solid results but guided for a slowdown in its upcoming third quarter. The guidance was enough to send the stock tumbling.\n\nSimilarly, ASML reported good results, but said that it could not confirm it will grow in 2026 due to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. However, ASML did reaffirm its 2030 targets, which (on the high end) guide for doubling revenue from 2024 levels and expanding gross margins from the low 50% range to 56% to 60%.\n\nNews that TI and ASML are expecting a near-term slowdown may spook investors. However, it's essential to understand how both companies fit into the broader AI narrative before overstating their impact on other AI stocks.\n\nNot all aspects of the semiconductor industry are booming\n\nIf the semiconductor industry were a house, Texas Instruments would be the fasteners holding everything together with its analog and embedded semiconductors.\n\nAnalog semiconductors take analog information and convert it into electric signals -- like a microphone turning a sound wave into an electric audio signal. These semiconductors are in consumer electronics, like speakers, but they are also in cellular radios, satellite communication devices, measurement devices, the automotive industry, healthcare applications, and more.\n\nEmbedded semiconductors perform functions and connect electronic devices. TI makes hardware and software solutions for processing, wireless connectivity, sensing, motor control, cybersecurity, safety, and more. Growth markets for embedded semiconductors include industrial automation, the automotive industry (sensors, cameras, radar, etc.), and edge AI.\n\nEdge AI involves running AI algorithms directly on a device, rather than in the cloud, and then transferring information to the device. For example, TI makes a number of solutions for factory automation that use AI microprocessors to improve efficiency, security, and enhance human-machine interaction.\n\nTI may not provide the essential graphics processing units (GPUs) or central processing units (CPUs) that are used in data centers, but it does contribute key associated infrastructure in the form of power management solutions, converters, controllers, and connectivity solutions. Power solutions help data centers boost power conversion by reducing energy waste and managing heat.\n\nDue to TI's exposure to numerous different end markets, the company's results can fluctuate in line with the broader economy. So, changes in the global supply chain, trade, and general economic growth can throw a wrench in its results. In fact, TI's growth has been negative over the last couple of years because demand boomed in 2022 and 2023 and has since slowed down. As you can see in the following chart, TI's stock price has gone practically nowhere for the last four years, and earnings are down significantly from their peak.\n\nOn the second-quarter 2025 earnings call, TI CEO Haviv Ilan said the following in response to an analyst question asking why TI is less optimistic about a cyclical recovery in the industry:\n\nBut I think all the situation of tariffs and geopolitics disrupting supply chains, I think that's not over. It's true that there is pause right now on the semiconductor tariffs, both in the U.S. and in China. But we have to be prepared for what the future may hold.\n\nIIan also said that there have been signals of industrial recovery, but that automotive hasn't recovered. In general, management's tone shifted from being upbeat about the near-term prospects to being more cautious. And that shift, paired with the stock running up into the earnings print, was enough to trigger a steep sell-off.\n\nASML's global supply chain and customer base make it vulnerable to trade tensions\n\nAMSL manufactures highly complex lithography machines used to produce semiconductor chips. Lithography is just one step in the semiconductor manufacturing process, but it is arguably the most crucial. ASML has a virtual monopoly on the latest technology in photolithography, called extreme ultraviolet (EUV). These machines are in high demand because they are essential for producing complex AI chips at scale.\n\nSo, while TI is a diversified company that sells a lot of different high-volume products to a variety of customers, ASML is a highly specialized company that depends on just a handful of customers (like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung Electronics, and Intel).\n\nIn its latest quarter, ASML sold 76 lithography systems for 5.541 billion euros in net bookings -- meaning each system sold for an average of $85.6 million. But the newer EUV systems can sell for $150 million to $400 million.\n\nEven for a company the size of Taiwan Semi, it takes a lot of capital to buy a handful of these machines. The spending cycle will ultimately depend on the capital allocation plans and demand from key customers (like Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, etc.).\n\nWhile TI indicated that the cycle could take longer to recover than initially anticipated, ASML's warnings were more closely tied to near-term uncertainties related to trade tensions and the economy.\n\nDespite being a Dutch company, and therefore not directly involved in U.S. trade policy, ASML is highly sensitive to trade tensions because the Netherlands (as a member of the EU and NATO) works closely with the U.S. on trade. ASML sources parts from around the world and sells the majority to its systems to customers in Asia. However, restrictions limit ASML from selling its most advanced systems to China.\n\nBalanced buys for investors looking for value in the semiconductor industry\n\nTI and ASML are similar in that they don't design or manufacture GPUs and CPUs, but rather, benefit from the overarching growth of AI and global connectivity. Despite their differences, both companies offered a useful reminder that the semiconductor industry is cyclical, and earnings can fluctuate for factors outside each company's control.\n\nThe degree to which TI and ASML's warnings impact other AI companies depends on the application. For example, TI's news could have ripple effects for companies like Analog Devices or NXPI Semiconductors. ASML's forecast may relate to other semiconductor equipment suppliers, such as Lam Research or Applied Materials. However, their forecasts don't directly impact chip designers, like Nvidia and Broadcom, or signal that demand for AI spending is slowing down (as evidenced by growing AI budgets from hyperscalers like Microsoft).\n\nAll told, TI and ASML remain solid investments in the semiconductor space, offering effective ways to capitalize on broader industry evolution. Both companies also pay growing dividends, especially TI, which features 21 consecutive years of dividend growth and has a 2.9% dividend yield.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:17:26.547102+00:00"}

Ironically, those who struck it rich usually weren't the hopeful gold prospectors, but the companies selling them the picks and shovels they needed to turn their dreams into reality.\n\nToday, individuals and corporations are rushing to invest in AI, fearing they may miss the next big thing. In the process, one technology company has fallen by the wayside -- and yet, AI probably doesn't happen without ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%). Here is why, and what makes the stock a potential table-pounding buy right now.\n\nASML's crucial role in keeping AI on the cutting edge of innovation\n\nTechnology revolves around microchips, pieces of silicon packed with tons of transistors -- tiny semiconductor devices that manipulate electrical signals. You could think of transistors as the cells that make up organic tissue.\n\nMaking technology more powerful and efficient requires packing microchips with an increasing number of transistors. For example, Nvidia's Blackwell GPU AI chip contains 208 billion of them! That's up from the 80 billion transistors in its predecessor, the H100.\n\nHowever, it's not easy fitting billions of transistors onto a piece of silicon you can hold in your hand. It requires a specialized process, known as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light lithography. ASML is the world's only company that builds these EUV machines, making it a critical player in artificial intelligence and other emerging high-tech applications, such as autonomous vehicles and humanoid robotics.\n\nLooking into why the stock is down\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding AI and its potential, ASML's stock has lagged. Shares have slumped by over 15% in the past 12 months, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has surged by over 20%.\n\nUnfortunately, the Dutch company has faced some turbulence related to global economic tensions. Tariffs have increased the costs of equipment, components, and supplies imported into the United States. Furthermore, the U.S. government has reportedly continued to pressure the Dutch government to limit ASML's business with China.\n\nThe company's management noted on ASML's Q2 2025 earnings call that the disruptions were causing some customers to hesitate, potentially slowing or delaying equipment purchases, which resulted in ASML issuing a cautious growth outlook for 2026.\n\nASML also sells to a small customer base. Since there are only a handful of prominent companies that manufacture chips, just three customers account for the majority of ASML's sales. One of those, Intel, has struggled. It's naturally riskier to have most of your eggs in just a few baskets, which has potentially weighed on investor sentiment as well.\n\nWhy ASML could be an excellent buy right now\n\nGiven the risks, it's understandable that the stock has performed as it has. That said, investors have the opportunity to step back and assess the broader picture here.\n\nAlthough tariffs and other issues may cloud ASML's short-term outlook, the long-term trend is clear: AI and other applications will demand more advanced chips. ASML's position as the dominant provider of lithography and EUV lithography systems will likely drive long-term growth.\n\nAdditionally, ASML's dominance helps mitigate customer concentration risks, as chip foundries are heavily dependent on these machines and cannot easily purchase them elsewhere. That could be why analysts still anticipate ASML growing earnings by an average of over 17% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nThe stock has slumped to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26. That's in line with its lowest P/E ratio over the past few years, and its lowest since 2019. In other words, ASML doesn't fall to these levels very often, especially given the market's focus on AI opportunities.\n\nIf there were no question marks, ASML probably wouldn't be this cheap. However, ASML should continue selling its ultra-important EUV systems for as long as the AI gold rush persists. Investors may well look back in hindsight and wish they had scooped up shares on the cheap.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:17:30.158483+00:00"}

Currently, 3 nanometers between electrical traces is the best available technology; however, ASML clients, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, are slated to launch 2nm chips later this year.\n\nBecause ASML's machines are highly specialized, it has only a handful of clients, making it relatively easy to monitor demand. Chip foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel are among its fairly small client list, and these two are moving in opposite directions. While TSMC is expanding its chip foundry capabilities by building plants in the U.S. (it has made a $165 billion commitment here), Intel isn't doing so great. Its foundry business is operating at a loss, and its CEO is starting to cut investments in this area.\n\nIt appears that TSMC is capturing market share, while Intel is losing it, resulting in relatively even demand for ASML's machines. This prompted ASML management to pull back on its language regarding the 2026 forecast. Previously, management had stated that 2026 would be a significant growth year for the business. Now, it is treading a bit lightly, saying: \"While we are still preparing for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage. We will continue monitoring developments over the coming months.\"\n\nThis caused some investors to panic and sell off the stock, but was that a logical reaction?\n\nASML's stock is well priced for the performance it's delivering\n\nASML backing down from its prior stance that 2026 would be a near-guaranteed growth year is somewhat concerning. With increasing chip demand, it's clear that its machines will be in greater demand, so this mismatch seems a bit odd, but in light of the Intel news, it makes more sense.\n\nFurthermore, ASML will need to continue innovating and developing new machines to advance toward emerging chip technologies. Moore's Law dictates that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, and ASML plays a critical role in ensuring that leaders remain on this upward trend.\n\nStill, 2025 isn't shaping up to be all that bad of a year. Management expects about 15% sales growth for the year, which isn't bad considering the company's size. Additionally, its net bookings experienced a significant increase from the total in Q1. In Q2, ASML reported net bookings of 5.5 billion euros, up from 3.9 billion euros in Q1. This indicates long-term demand for its machines is rising, which is a positive sign for shareholders.\n\nCurrently, ASML trades for less than 26 times forward earnings, which isn't bad considering ASML is in a solid position and still posting solid growth.\n\nAlthough management is being slightly more cautious about 2026, I don't think investors need to be. ASML is a very important part of the chip industry, and it isn't going anywhere. Even if 2026 isn't the best year, most of that spending would likely be pushed out to 2027 and realized eventually.\n\nI think this makes ASML a great stock to buy, hold, and forget about. The lumpy nature of ASML's business makes it more effective to analyze over the years, rather than by quarters. With the long-term trend heading toward more chips and more advanced ones, it bodes well for ASML, making it an attractive investment opportunity today.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:17:34.030097+00:00"}

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nMarvell Technology’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 40 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 13 days ago when the stock dropped 4.3% after a cautious outlook from semiconductor equipment giant ASML sparked a broad sell-off across the sector, hitting chipmakers and equipment suppliers alike. The negative sentiment was triggered after the Dutch firm, whose complex machines are essential for producing advanced chips, warned it could no longer guarantee growth in 2026. ASML's management cited \"increasing uncertainty driven by macro-economic and geopolitical developments,\" including the potential for new U.S. tariffs. As an industry bellwether, a company whose performance is seen as an indicator of the entire sector's health, ASML's comments are a key signal of future capital spending. The warning sent a chill through the market, as concerns grow that trade tensions could disrupt the highly globalized semiconductor supply chain and slow down investment from chip manufacturers.\n\nMarvell Technology is down 32% since the beginning of the year, and at $77.24 per share, it is trading 38.7% below its 52-week high of $126.06 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Marvell Technology’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,200.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

The development is said to mark a turning point for the Dutch chip equipment giant, whose shares had dropped around 13% since its second-quarter earnings event amid tariff-related concerns. “With the conclusion of US-EU trade deal over the weekend, ASML scores big with what appears to be zero-tariff rate for imports into the US,” Lynx Equity Strategies wrote. “Based on the outcome … we reiterate the call [to buy the recent pullback].” The agreement, announced by the U.S. and EU presidents, will subject EU imports on average to a 15% tariff. However, semicap equipment, listed as a strategic product, will be excluded, facing a “zero-for-zero” tariff regime. “It appears as if EU-based semicap companies may no longer be subjected to Section 232 investigation,” Lynx noted. ASML had previously withdrawn its 2026 guidance due to trade uncertainty. “At the Q2 earnings call, the CEO stated uncertainty [on] US tariffs as the reason for pulling the 2026 revenue guidance,” Lynx recalled. That contrasted with the firm’s more upbeat view at its Q1 results. Lynx had earlier argued that ASML imports were “too important to face US tariffs,” and now sees the new deal replacing uncertainty with “stability” and “predictability,” echoing the EU President’s remarks. “With the US tariff, not merely no longer an issue, but set to zero-for-zero tariffs, we think it likely for ASML management to revert to its previous stance of calling 2026 a growth year.

The stock is currently below both its historical averages and peers, but there is limited risk of further de-rating.\n\nASML: Limited China Risk, Strong AI Exposure Could Drive Outperformance\n\nA technician operating a robotic arm on a production line of semiconductor chips.\n\nMoreover, while it remains unclear how much spending will be done on wafer fab equipment, a broader pullback can be expected next year.\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) develops and sells advanced semiconductor equipment, including lithography, metrology, and inspection systems for chip manufacturing.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Here are three stocks you may want to land on instead.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR 2.30%) continues to rip higher, a fun and potentially life-changing ride for anyone who has bought and held over the past couple of years.\n\nBut buying the hottest stock on Wall Street only works until it doesn't -- nothing goes up forever. Palantir's valuation is at precarious heights, so investors looking to put new money to work may be better off looking to other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nThat doesn't mean sacrificing on quality. There are several companies at the cutting edge of the AI boom trading at reasonable valuations that stand to deliver outsize investment returns over the long term.\n\nHere are three prime examples to consider. All three could have far more upside than Palantir at their current prices.\n\n1. Nvidia's valuation remains reasonable despite a similar run\n\nInvestors looking for the market's top performers should look no further than Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard chips used in massive data centers to train and operate power-hungry AI models.\n\nThe stock has returned over 900% in the past three years, but the company's sales and earnings have largely kept pace with the share price, preventing the valuation from becoming too high.\n\nAnalysts expect the chipmaker to grow earnings by an average of 29% annually over the long term. The stock's current price-to-earnings ratio of 56 is still very reasonable for that growth. The business must still perform to those expectations, but the signs are encouraging.\n\nData center investments are poised to continue. McKinsey & Company is forecasting over $7 trillion in spending over the next five years, with more than $5 trillion of that allocated for processing AI loads.\n\nAnd the government is easing its export restrictions on Nvidia, paving the way for the company to resume selling its H20 chips to China. It all bodes well for the stock.\n\n2. Alphabet's recent rise can continue\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%), has been on a hot streak lately. Shares have risen about 15% over just the past month.\n\nConcerns over regulatory threats and AI disruption to the company's core search engine business had weighed on the stock earlier this year. But Google Search revenue's 11.7% growth year over year in the second quarter of 2025 shows that the core business isn't done yet.\n\nBarring drastic actions from regulators, it's doubtful that the Google ecosystem will disappear overnight. For now, investors can shift their attention to the positive developments at Alphabet, such as its progress in AI; surging cloud computing profits; and the steady expansion of Waymo, its autonomous ride-hailing service. It remains a juggernaut in the tech sector that few companies can match.\n\nLastly, the company's growth prospects look solid. Analysts have lowered their long-term estimates over the past year but still expect over 14% annualized earnings increases. At a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 21, there is still enough value here for the stock to continue building on its recent momentum.\n\n3. ASML seems poised for a rebound\n\nFor all the excitement AI has generated among investors, ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) struggled, with its stock tumbling 24% over the past year. The company is crucial to the AI landscape as the only one that builds extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, which are essential for printing complex patterns on high-end microchips used for AI and in other cutting-edge applications.\n\nASML's headaches stem from the uncertainty of tariff policies. It disrupted its business, prompting management to issue a cautious outlook for next year, despite posting a strong second quarter. It now trades at a P/E of 26, a valuation rarely this low over the past 10 years.\n\nThe stock's decline could be an excellent buying opportunity. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's recent strong quarter highlights the ongoing demand for AI chips, and analysts still expect ASML to grow its earnings by an average of 17% annually over the long term. In other words, tariffs may delay spending on the company's equipment in some cases, but they are unlikely to stop it. Look for a rebound once the tariff situation becomes clearer.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:17:54.240655+00:00"}

Its EV sales are declining, and new models like the Cybertruck have been a commercial flop.\n\nIt is betting the house on speculative self-driving and humanoid robot technologies. All the while, CEO Elon Musk is investing in artificial intelligence (AI), but through an entirely different company: xAI.\n\nIt looks like a tough road ahead for the once-beloved brand. Here's why investors should forget it and buy two other AI stocks instead.\n\nASML's manufacturing tailwinds\n\nCompanies such as xAI are investing billions of dollars in advanced computer chips. In order to meet this demand, manufacturers are increasing chipmaking capacity in the U.S. and other countries around the world. This will be a boon for ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%).\n\nASML is the leader in making lithography machines for semiconductors, which help build intricate patterns on silicon wafers. The company's extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) systems are the only way that advanced computer chips designed by the likes of Nvidia can be made en masse.\n\nThis gives the company a large demand tailwind from AI and huge power over the semiconductor supply chain. It's why it can sell its machines for hundreds of millions of dollars with over 50% gross margins.\n\nTraders sold off ASML stock recently after its second-quarter earnings update and tentative guidance due to U.S. tariffs. However, the company is still guiding for 15% net sales growth this year and 44 billion to 60 billion euros ($51.5 billion to $70.3 billion) in revenue by 2030.\n\nIt also expects gross margins to keep ticking higher at greater scale, with guidance for upward of 60%. This could help operating margins leap to 40% compared to 36% over the last 12 months.\n\nA 40% operating margin on $70.3 billion in revenue equates to $28 billion in operating income. Compared to a market cap of $280 billion today, this earnings potential means that ASML stock is cheap after its latest drawdown and deserves consideration in one's portfolio.\n\nA historical opportunity for Google\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is a huge driver of demand for computer chips and ASML's machines as one of the leading AI companies. As the owner of Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud, the technology giant is in prime position to take advantage of this historical opportunity.\n\nIt can create consumer demand through new products such as Google AI Overviews and its Gemini chatbot, which are both seeing an extreme increase in use at the moment. Only Alphabet has the in-house computing infrastructure to support so many people using its products at once.\n\nAI growth can drive revenue to new heights for Google and associated consumer products like YouTube. Last quarter, Google Services revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $77 billion.\n\nMore promising may be Alphabet's outsourcing of AI computing infrastructure through Google Cloud. It has spent years investing in chips and data centers focused on AI computing, which is now helping it gain market share in cloud spending.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue increased 28% year over year last quarter to $12.3 billion. It is much smaller than Google Services today, but it has a huge runway left as AI proliferates in the software industry over the next decade and beyond.\n\nEven though it is already one of the largest companies in the world, Alphabet can use AI to drive further revenue and earnings increases in the next decade. At a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 21, the stock looks like an appetizing buy.\n\nBoth these companies look like much better bets than Tesla. ASML has a P/E of 26, while Tesla's is over 180. ASML and Alphabet are growing; Tesla isn't at the moment. If you own the EV maker, it might be time to start thinking about better replacements in your portfolio to play the AI boom.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:17:58.827660+00:00"}

ASML stock has lost 18% of its value during this period. The company's latest results for the second quarter of 2025 added to investors' misery. ASML stock fell more than 8% following release of the company's Q2 report on July 16.\n\nLet's see why that was the case and find out if this semiconductor stock's poor performance in the past year is an opportunity for savvy investors to buy a potential long-term winner.\n\nASML's cloudy 2026 guidance is weighing on the stock\n\nASML's latest quarterly numbers ticked all the right boxes. The company reported a 24% increase in revenue from the year-ago period, while its earnings shot up by 47%. Its numbers were well ahead of consensus expectations. The Dutch company received new orders worth 5.5 billion euros during the quarter, well ahead of the Wall Street estimate of 4.8 billion euros.\n\nHowever, ASML's Q3 guidance of 7.4 billion euros to 7.9 billion euros in revenue was lower than analysts' expectations of 8.2 billion euros. Investors were also alarmed by the company's 2026 outlook. Though it is expecting a 15% increase in revenue this year, CEO Christophe Fouquet remarked that while the company is preparing \"for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage.\"\n\nASML's 2026 outlook is clouded by the \"increasing uncertainty driven by macro-economic and geopolitical developments\" even though it is witnessing strong demand from artificial intelligence (AI) customers. So, while ASML's bookings increased by 40% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the company's conservative guidance indicates that it is wary of the ongoing tariff-related turmoil and export controls that have the potential to hamper semiconductor sales.\n\nAs such, there is a good chance that ASML stock could continue to remain under pressure in the near term on account of the negative sentiment created by its cautious outlook. However, if the stock continues to dip further, it may be a good idea to buy it from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe company is confident of achieving its long-term targets\n\nThough ASML has warned about the potential impact of tariffs and other geopolitical developments on its growth next year, the company believes that the semiconductor market will keep growing in the long run, thanks to catalysts such as AI. That's the reason why ASML has reiterated its 2030 revenue forecast of 44 billion euros to 60 billion euros, the midpoint of which points toward a 60% increase in its top line from this year's projected revenue of 32.5 billion euros.\n\nASML also expects its gross margin to land between 56% and 60% by the end of the decade. Again, that would be a nice bump over its 2025 gross margin forecast of 52% at the midpoint. The long-term guidance seems achievable considering the global investments being made in AI infrastructure, which is encouraging semiconductor manufacturers to increase their capital expenses on equipment.\n\nMcKinsey is forecasting that a whopping $6.7 trillion will be spent on data centers across the globe by 2030 to support both AI and non-AI workloads. The firm adds that 60% of the spending will go toward manufacturing chips and other computing hardware. Not surprisingly, McKinsey is expecting a $1 trillion investment in new semiconductor plants through the end of the decade.\n\nASML's 90% share of the global lithography equipment market puts it in a solid position to capitalize on this massive spending on semiconductor plants over the next five years. As a result, there is a good chance that ASML will be able to regain its mojo in the long run and deliver solid gains to investors. That's why buying ASML stock while it is under pressure could turn out to be a smart move.\n\nIt is trading at 26 times earnings right now, which is a discount to the average earnings multiple of 51 for the U.S. technology sector. The company's growth has been solid of late, as its latest quarterly results tell us, and the prospects of the semiconductor equipment market could help it sustain that momentum in the long run as well.\n\nConsidering the potential margin gains that ASML is anticipating over the next five years, the company seems set to deliver robust bottom-line growth. In all, savvy investors can consider accumulating this semiconductor stock while it is under pressure as it could eventually turn out to be a winner going forward.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:02.462401+00:00"}

Here's why ASML has the makings of a foundational growth stock for long-term investors to buy and hold for years to come.\n\nA monopoly on semiconductor manufacturing\n\nThe semiconductor manufacturing process consists of cleaning chips, depositing materials onto those chips, coating the wafers with positive and negative photoresist, lithography, etching away unwanted materials, implanting positive and negative ions, and packaging.\n\nASML -- which originally stood for Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography -- sells systems that essentially print circuit designs layer by layer onto silicon wafers until the 3D structure of the microchip is complete. Lithography is arguably the most complex and important step in manufacturing semiconductors.\n\nSuppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research make equipment that is used in other steps. But no company in the world holds a candle to ASML when it comes to making extremely advanced systems for manufacturing chips for AI applications. ASML's latest models, called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, are essential for fulfilling AI order volumes.\n\nThe company is seeing a shift in its product mix from memory applications to logic, with 84% of net system bookings in the latest quarter used for logic end-use cases compared to 16% for memory. ASML's EUV machines are really good at making chips for logic, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) used to handle complex AI workflows.\n\nHowever, EUV machines are also used for memory chips, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM). AI models depend on the working memory capacity of DRAM to store data for quick access. ASML sees demand for these EUV machines growing over time to fulfill AI needs. But it won't happen overnight.\n\nASML is forecasting steady growth through 2030 -- including revenue doubling from 2024 levels based on the high end of estimates. For 2025, ASML projects 15% revenue growth and 52% gross margin. But in its second-quarter earnings materials, ASML said that it can't confirm growth in 2026 due to macroeconomic uncertainties and trade tensions. The forecast spooked investors -- causing the stock to fall 10.8% in three days.\n\nASML is built for long-term investors\n\nASML's business model is unlike any other company's in the semiconductor space. Its machines fetch high margins due to their sophistication and use for the most advanced semiconductor applications. But ASML has a different sales cycle than other tech companies.\n\nASML sells its lithography machines to fabrication companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), which produces GPUs for designers like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which sells its GPUs to hyperscalers like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which uses GPUs in its data centers to service its cloud customers, which are building AI tools and software. It's essential to recognize that ASML's sales are directly influenced by fabs needing to manufacture higher volumes and more complex chips.\n\nThe timing of when a key ASML customer orders a few machines can alter its results by quite a bit. In ASML's most recent quarter, the company sold 76 new units for 5.596 billion euros in revenue ($6.5 billion) or an average price of $85.5 million per unit. If trade tensions heat up and even one key ASML customer pauses orders, like Taiwan Semi, Samsung Electronics, or Intel, it could throw a wrench in the company's results and derail its short-term growth.\n\nThat risk is what ASML management called out on its earnings call. Management is being cautious and reminding investors of an inherent characteristic of its business. It is, by no means, a red flag that demand is slowing down.\n\nASML's latest EUV machines are about the size of a double-decker bus and weigh hundreds of thousands of pounds. They take months to ship and install at fab sites, often requiring hundreds of engineers. The complexity and processing of orders make ASML's sales vulnerable to economic cycles and changes in trade policies. ASML has to procure parts from around the world to build these machines in the first place, which would be more expensive if tariffs were to become widespread.\n\nIn sum, ASML plays an essential role in chip production. But due to the nature of its business model, its results can ebb and flow for factors that have nothing to do with the underlying investment thesis.\n\nASML is a compelling value\n\nASML is telling investors that its results over the next year and half could vary based on tariff policy and the timing of customer spending, but that the long-term future is brighter due to AI's appetite for computing power. So it's best to focus on where the company will be several years from now rather than the coming quarters.\n\nLet's assume that ASML achieves its 2025 goal of growing revenue by 15% to 32.55 billion euros ($37.85 billion) and then doesn't grow in 2026 because tariffs lead customers to delay some orders.\n\nIn that case, ASML would need to increase revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.8% over the next four years to reach the low end of its 2030 revenue goal of 44 billion euros ($51.16 billion) and a 16.5% CAGR to reach the high end of its 2030 revenue goal of 60 billion euros ($69.77 billion). It's not a breakneck growth rate, but the ultra-high gross margin allows ASML to convert a substantial amount of revenue into profit, making the stock a great value in terms of earnings per share.\n\nIn ASML's latest quarter, it earned 7.7 billion euros ($8.92 billion) in sales and 2.3 billion euros ($2.66 billion) in net income for a profit margin of 29.8% and 5.90 euros in earnings per share ($6.85). The conversion from sales to earnings was roughly the same in its first quarter and in 2024 as well. So if we pencil in about 30% profit margin for ASML in 2030, it would generate 13.2 to 20 billion euros ($15.3 to $23.2 billion) in net income -- although the profit margin could be even higher given ASML expects gross margin expansion.\n\nBased on ASML's market capitalization of about $289 billion at the time of this writing, the stock is trading for somewhere in the ballpark of 12.4 to 18.9 times 2030 earnings estimates. Its price-to-earnings ratio based on its trailing-12-month earnings is just 26.3. By its current earnings and management's projections through 2030, ASML has become too cheap to ignore.\n\nTime to double up on ASML stock\n\nASML checks all the boxes for a stock to own over the long term. It makes high-margin, industry-leading products that address rapidly growing end markets. The company has set clear expectations for 2030 and outlined the technology and end markets that will drive the projected growth. But it also acknowledges that the quarter-to-quarter path to unlock that growth may be choppy.\n\nASML isn't the kind of stock that warrants jumping in and out of, or reading too much into, the day-to-day price action. Rather, it's a company worth owning over the long term if you want exposure to the growth of AI and technological advancement across industries.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:10.951895+00:00"}

Like other nations that supply dual-use materials, it also requires applicants to fill out questionnaires certifying what they will ultimately be used for. Since April, China has approved a total of 1,500 six-month licenses to individual companies, and rejected an EU request to grant multi-year licenses, according to European officials.\n\nThere isn’t a quick fix to securing Europe’s critical mineral supply. While European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has vowed to respond firmly to what she has described as blackmail by China, a longer-term plan requires substantial investment and political will — neither of which the 27 member states are able to generate easily.\n\n“Companies and politicians view this topic differently, and governments obviously have to look at the bigger picture,” said Jakob Kullik, a researcher studying metals supplies at the University of Technology in Chemnitz, Germany. “That’s why I would be careful about what companies report, because the market figures tell a different story.”\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were planted in early April, when Beijing cut off exports of critical minerals, such as terbium, yttrium or samarium, usedin missiles, satellites and fighter jets — and implemented a far more restrictive system to oversee their release. China holds a quasi-monopoly over the mining and processing of many critical minerals, and the country’s ability to choose winners and losers has nudged leaders in Brussels towards an alarming realization, according to people familiar with their thinking: Europe’s ability to protect itself relies heavily on China.\n\nWhile defense manufacturers say they can rely on stockpiling and diversified supply chains to keep their operations running, with traders turning to the secondary market, the supply crunch may soon start to bite unless a solution is found.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- European metals traders are engaged in an increasingly frantic scramble to secure rare-earth metal supplies after it became all but impossible to directly source them from China.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEU officials have described the new system as cumbersome and unsustainable, and asked Beijing to eliminate its questionnaires, which could be used to gauge the contents and size of military arsenals. But they concede that little is likely to change.\n\nWhen EU and Chinese officials meet in Beijing this week to celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations, rare earths will be a top agenda item — although expectations of any grand resolution are low. Some fear that China might use access to critical minerals as a way to extract concessions from the bloc on pending trade investigations or tariffs on electric vehicles, the people said. That’s in part why some officials are pushing the EU to threaten China with restrictions on exports of French aircraft parts or semiconductor equipment from the Dutch chip equipment company ASML Holding NV, they added.\n\nBut a tougher approach faces a multitude of challenges. There’s no consensus within the bloc on how to counter China or how far possible retaliation should go, and the EU commission has also been undermined by member states negotiating directly with Beijing to secure deals for their own industries, the people said.\n\nCountries striking out on their own are following a trajectory set by the US, which decided to conduct its own talks with Beijing after rare earth imports came to a halt. That culminated in a trade truce in June, with the US agreeing to lower tariffs and remove export controls on chip design software, aircraft parts and ethane shipments in order to keep imports flowing. Total mineral exports rose to 3,188 tons in June, according to Chinese data, more than double the 1,238 tons in May.\n\nSome defense companies have started stockpiling components, while others have expressed confidence that their supply chains are sufficiently diversified. Yet some industry experts believe that firms are downplaying the situation or are failing to fully grasp how serious it may be. A more structural solution — such as getting companies directly involved in extracting and processing raw materials — remains risky and requires a kind of expertise that is all but lost within Europe.\n\nIn the meantime, Chinese officials, aware that they have the upper hand, have adopted more blunt rhetoric towards their European and American counterparts.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas earlier this month that Beijing doesn’t want Russia to lose the war in Ukraine because the US would then shift its attention to China, according to people familiar with the exchange. China has said that it has played no role in the conflict in Ukraine and rebuffed accusations from the Group of Seven that it is supplying Russia with materials critical to sustaining its war effort.\n\nShould China further tighten restrictions on rare earth exports, it could not only hinder the EU’s defenses against Russia. It would also highlight Beijing’s leverage over the European defense companies that arm Ukraine — and China’s ability to control the provision of weapons to Kyiv.\n\nAs the geopolitical tradeoffs and risks become clearer, EU leaders are thinking more seriously about how to reduce the bloc’s mineral dependency on China. The strongest legislation to date, the Critical Raw Materials Act, entered into force last year but has been criticized by industry for failing to pull together the necessary funding. The act includes proposals to create domestic supply chains for minerals and to recycle more rare-earth elements from used electronics. Traders agree that in order to make this work, significant financial incentives would be required, partly because sending electronic waste back to China is cheaper than recycling in the European Union.\n\nOne potential role model for how Europe might de-risk is Japan, which was cut off from Chinese rare earth exports in 2010. Japan responded by tasking a government agency to invest in overseas mining operations, and has built up supply chains in places including Australia and France.\n\nIf the situation with China continues to escalate, Europe may need to pursue a similar approach, said Kullik, the politics researcher. He suggested that the bloc should aim to build rare-earth processing plants on the continent with the long-term goal of developing strategic stockpiles. After that, he said, the EU would have to adopt its own protectionist measures.\n\n“If a conflict really comes about,” he said, “that would be the only logical solution.”\n\n--With assistance from Arne Delfs, James Mayger, Michal Kubala and Alberto Nardelli.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:13.132858+00:00"}

However, the growth stock continued falling over the next couple of days and is now down 21% over the past year.\n\nThe company makes advanced lithography machines that chip manufacturers use to produce chips designed by companies like Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) and Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%). ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems pack an unprecedented number of transistors into each silicon wafer, advancing precision and lowering manufacturing costs. These machines are the muscle behind the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ASML sell-off, and whether it could have ripple effects that could drag Nvidia and Broadcom down from their all-time highs.\n\nASML's solid results were overshadowed by its guidance\n\nASML reported its most recent quarterly results on July 16. It had a great second quarter and is guiding for 15% revenue growth and slightly higher gross margins for the full year. The semiconductor equipment supplier reaffirmed its 2030 targets, which forecast revenue to increase by 55% to 112% from its 2024 results of 28.3 billion euros ($32.81 billion), and gross margin expansion from the low 50% range to 56% to 60%.\n\nThe margin expansion is likely due to the company's anticipated increase in EUV machines in its sales mix. Right now, its older and less advanced deep ultraviolet machines (DUV) still make up the bulk of new sales. ASML brings in a significant amount of revenue by servicing existing machines for its customers. Margins should grow as the sales mix shifts to more expensive EUV machines -- especially its roughly $400 million ultra-powered high-numerical aperture (high-NA) versions.\n\nThe near-term results and the 2030 targets aren't the issue. Rather, it's a murky medium-term outlook. ASML cited geopolitical challenges and macroeconomic headwinds that are affecting its customers and the timing of their spending.\n\nThe company is directly affected by tariffs on imports to its U.S. manufacturing centers and field operations. ASML also sources components from around the world to build its machines, so it has a complex supply chain that is vulnerable to tariffs.\n\nAlthough ASML is a Dutch company, the Netherlands works closely with the U.S. on trade policy. This limits ASML's ability to sell products to China, despite China's rapidly growing demand for semiconductor lithography systems. As it stands today, ASML can't sell its most advanced systems to China -- just older, lower-cost units.\n\nThere's also the indirect effect of tariffs, which could involve a more severe industrywide slowdown and a shift in customer sentiment. Given the uncertainty, ASML said that it cannot confirm it will grow in 2026. That's likely the reason that the stock is selling off.\n\nNvidia and Broadcom operate upstream of ASML along the AI value chain\n\nASML's latest earnings report and management commentary were a reminder of the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry. Despite widespread enthusiasm and spending on AI, downturns can still happen for geopolitical or macroeconomic reasons, from tariffs and trade policy to interest rates and the timing of the investment cycle.\n\nBefore Nvidia and Broadcom investors start to worry, it's important to remember that ASML operates in a very different sales cycle from those two companies. ASML sold just 76 new lithography units in its latest quarter. That's less than one sale per day. You would be hard-pressed to find a company with a market cap of nearly $290 billion with an order volume that small. But it's a testament to the sophistication of ASML's cutting-edge tech. The company has a virtual monopoly, and its customers are willing to pay a high price for its machines because they're worth it in the long run if they can reduce costs and improve precision. But because these units are so expensive, it's easier for a key customer to decide to delay a purchase by a year or two to wait for more favorable conditions.\n\nIn its latest quarter, ASML said that 35% of new system sales were in Taiwan, while 27% were in China, 19% were in South Korea, 10% were in the U.S., and 9% were in other places. You can bet that the majority of sales in Taiwan are going to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), South Korea is probably Samsung Electronics (SSNL.F 9.01%), and the U.S. is mostly Intel (INTC 5.59%).\n\nNvidia and Broadcom have international exposure, too. But their sales cycle is far different because they aren't just selling a few big-ticket items every quarter. Nvidia makes most of its money selling graphics processing units (GPUs), software, and associated infrastructure to build AI ecosystems for hyperscalers. Hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) are raking in the free cash flow and pouring capital expenditures into AI investments -- benefiting Nvidia.\n\nBroadcom is experiencing explosive growth from hyperscalers for its AI chips. But Broadcom does a lot outside AI, from network connectivity to cybersecurity, broadband, wireless, and infrastructure software.\n\nBoth Nvidia and Broadcom have international exposure and are vulnerable to trade tensions and tariff risks, but their sales cycles are distinctly different from ASML's. So ASML's warning of an impending slowdown doesn't necessarily mean the same for Nvidia and Broadcom. However, if fabs (the fabricators) slow down their investment, it could lead to a backlog buildup, which could delay shipments for chip designers.\n\nZooming out in the semiconductor industry\n\nThe sell-off in ASML stock is a reaction to near-term guidance and has nothing to do with the long-term investment. The best way to approach any chip stock, especially ones with expensive valuations like Nvidia and Broadcom, is to take a long-term view, preferably at least three to five years.\n\nIf you believe in the long-term growth of global connectivity and AI and that Nvidia and Broadcom will remain industry leaders, then both stocks are probably worth buying and holding. Even a few quarters or a few years of bad earnings will ultimately be made up for by the long-term investment thesis playing out.\n\nHowever, the further stock prices outpace earnings growth, and the more expensive valuations become, the more hot air fills the stock price, which can go out just as fast as it went in. Therefore, it's essential to approach these stocks with the right mindset and accept that geopolitical and macroeconomic factors can have a massive effect on the stock prices of these companies in the short term.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:14.708346+00:00"}

ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) fell 8.3% on July 16 in response to its second-quarter 2025 results and guidance.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/23/buy-asml-ai-growth-stock/", "published_at": "2025-07-23T08:04:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "ASML (ASML 2.81%) fell 8.3% on July 16 in response to its second-quarter 2025 results and guidance. Investors may be wondering why ASML dipped so much, given it beat analyst estimates for the quarter.\n\nHere's why the sell-off is a buying opportunity for long-term investors interested in an exciting artificial intelligence (AI) growth stock.\n\nA long-term winner from AI investment\n\nASML makes semiconductor lithography machines that are used by chip foundries (like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Samsung Electronics (OTC: SSNL.F), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), etc.). ASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems use lenses to print features on microchips, while its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems use mirrors.\n\nThe EUV machines are magnitudes more expensive than DUV, with the latest ultra-powered high-numerical aperture (high-NA) versions costing as much as $400 million a pop and the low-NA EUVs starting at about $150 million. DUVs cost anywhere from $5 million to $90 million.\n\nDUVs still make up the majority of ASML's sales. EUVs are more precise, have fewer errors, reduce manufacturing time, and lower overall costs, making them a good long-term investment, especially for fabs that are fulfilling more chip orders to keep up with artificial intelligence (AI) demand.\n\nIn this vein, the build-out and commercialization of EUV technology has been the unsung hero behind the AI revolution. The EUV machines are so precise that they print microchips using light with wavelengths of just 13.5 nanometers -- which is almost as small as an X-ray. The technology allows ASML to pack more transistors per microchip, which is essential for increasing computing power.\n\nLaying the groundwork for future growth\n\nWith two quarters now in the books, ASML updated its full-year guidance. The company expects sales to grow 15% compared to 2024 (which would be 32.55 billion euros or $37.79 billion) and gross margin to be around 52% -- which is slightly higher than the 2024 gross margin of 51.3%.\n\nHowever, the company stated that it is experiencing increasing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, which will directly and indirectly impact its business and the timing of capital expenditures for its customers. The line that likely spooked investors the most from ASML's press release was the following: \"Against this backdrop, while we are still preparing for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage. We will continue monitoring developments over the coming months.\"\n\nThe guidance came as a surprise given ASML is seeing strong demand for its EUV technology and that AI spending has been surging, especially from hyperscalers with deep pockets. But long-term investors can rest easy knowing that the company's medium-term guidance, released in November 2024, is still intact. ASML still expects 44 billion to 60 billion euros ($51.08 billion to $69.65 billion) in 2030 revenue, and gross margin to rise to a new range of 56% to 60%.\n\nASML's margin increase is likely due to EUV bookings making up a higher percentage of revenue. In its latest quarter, ASML's total net sales of 7.69 billion euros ($8.9 billion) consisted of 2.1 billion euros ($2.43 billion) of servicing its installed base and 5.5 billion euros ($6.37 billion) in net bookings, of which 2.3 billion euros ($2.66 billion) or 42% were EUVs. However, ASML only sold 11 new EUVs in the quarter compared to 76 systems in total -- showcasing just how expensive and high-margin these machines are.\n\nTaking the EUV bookings and dividing them by 11 tells us that the average EUV sales price in the quarter was 209 million euros, or $242 million. ASML's margins should continue rising as EUVs make up a larger percentage of net bookings, and the share of EUVs it sells pivots from majority low-NA to high-NA.\n\nASML is a high-conviction buy\n\nThe sell-off in ASML stock is an overreaction and a reminder that stock prices can move in the short term for reasons that have little to do with the long-term investment thesis. Management is being cautious and wants to avoid overpromising and underdelivering. But throughout its earnings materials and commentary on the earnings call, the company reiterated strong demand for its EUV systems and the long-term potential of AI.\n\nASML is telling investors with a five-year time horizon to expect steady growth over that period, which is a great setup that makes the high-margin company a compelling value.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that ASML said it plans to continue repurchasing stock, which should reduce the share count and accelerate earnings growth. The company is also rewarding its shareholders with passive income by continuing to raise the dividend. ASML only yields about 1.1%, but it's still a decent dividend considering many growth stocks have even lower yields or don't even pay dividends.\n\nAdd it all up, and ASML stands out as an excellent stock to double up on now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:24.947394+00:00"}

In reality, no company can ever guarantee future growth with absolute certainty, a reality and truth that the market seems to not understand. In the same breath, he explicitly stated that ASML is preparing for growth, a crucial nuance the market has chosen to ignore entirely. As a side note, semiconductor markets shot up on Monday of this week saw export restrictions on China semiconductor sales and shipments being lifted by US regulators, as 27% of ASML revenue is directly tied to Chinese exposure, this would strengthen the sales and continuing operations to the region moving forward.\n\nAny understanding or deeper look at the semiconductor manufacturing process and the reporting of its key customers would show this comment is incredibly conservative and downplaying the reality of operations. On the downstream supply chain, Nvidia, AMD, Micron and Taiwan Semiconductor and nearly any company related continue to explode both in growth, share price, and capital expenditures. Unprecedented levels of capital are flooding into development at a staggering pace, particularly from megacap tech companies. The idea that ASML could experience a flat year, despite earnings that reflect strong booking growth and clear momentum, ignores the sheer scale and velocity of AI-driven investment, a view not supported by capital markets.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to see increasing uncertaintydriven by macro economic and geopolitical developments. Therefore, while westill prepare for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage.\n\nToday, ASML, the monopoly semiconductor equipment giant, reported its highly anticipated earnings results. By any financial metric, the earnings were phenomenal, 8.92 billion USD in revenue compared to ~7 billion in Q2 2024, 2.656 billion in net income and nearly a 200% increase in bookings quarter over quarter. In the quarter the company reported an astonishing 54% gross margin as ASML displays its near unlimited pricing power, the company can effectively set the price on its advanced lithography and its primary customers (Samsung, TSMC, Micron, SMIC) have no choice but to accept the cost, there is quite literally no other alternative available on the planet. With such impressive results, major headlines initially were surrounding an earnings blowout due to bookings coming in above expectation, yet, what followed was a dramatic 11% drop in the stock price. Why you might ask?\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile it is absolutely possible that tariffs and significant trade barriers hit the semiconductor/tech market hard enough to instill zero 2026 growth, from a financial standpoint it would seem this pessimism is exaggerated. It's important to break down the market context, the comment itself, and ASML's longer-term position in the semiconductor ecosystem beyond just 2026 regardless of one somewhat negative comment.\n\nConservative CEO Commentary, Not a Warning\n\nWhen CEOs discuss uncertainty, they are almost always speaking from a place of necessary conservatism. It is prudent for leadership to acknowledge macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical risks, it shows they are realistic and prepared for a range of scenarios. In ASML's case, the comment wasn't a signal of deteriorating demand or internal weakness. Instead, it reflected a responsible approach to guidance amid a complicated global environment.\n\nInvestors, however, seized on the ambiguity and treated it as a dire warning, despite there being no fundamental change in the company's demand trajectory. The reality is that semiconductor demand downstream remains strong and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.\n\nASML Stock is Exceptionally Cheap for AI Industry Exposure\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, a discounted cash flow calculation using short term growth estimate of 14% (in line with other semiconductor manufacturing participants with much less critical infrastructure), a long term growth rate of 3% and a current year EPS of 26.33, would result in a 928.39 intrinsic value per share. Once you account for cash, receivables summarized in net tangible assets of 13 billion, a strong backlog and a strong 14 billion dollar buyback authorization, the true fair value per share is be at or above 1,000\n\nDCF Model ASML Equity:\n\nASML Earnings\n\nThe Gurufocus fair value estimate would place the fair value of the stock at 1,005.14, implying a ~30% upside, and also a favorable risk return setup, the sheer profitability and execution of ASML legitimately warrant prices such as this, along with a fair margin of safety currently baked in to the current price.\n\nASML Gurufocus Fair Value Estimate:\n\nASML Earnings\n\nAs a quick note on the financials, taking a look at the profitability metrics/ratios, its plainly obvious that ASML delivers unmatched profitability metrics which are seen in only a handful of public companies in existence. An incredible 53% Return on equity, 40.51% return on capital employed, and a net profit margin of nearly 30% and an outright 10/10 profitability rank shows the company is more than capable of printing cash flows with consistency and it reflects in the financials.\n\nASML Profitability Metrics:\n\nASML Earnings\n\n*Gurufocus ASML Summary\n\nSemiconductor Demand is Rapidly Increasing:\n\nThe modern economy is increasingly reliant on advanced semiconductors, which are essential in everything from smartphones and data centers to autonomous vehicles and, most notably, artificial intelligence (AI). AI alone is creating an insatiable appetite for high-performance chips, which in turn drives demand for cutting-edge lithography machines, ASML's specialty.\n\nUnlike many cyclical tech sectors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment benefits from structural growth drivers. Every leap in chip performance requires more sophisticated manufacturing processes. ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines are the critical enablers of these advanced chips. In fact, no other company in the world can produce EUV machines at the scale and precision ASML can, putting it in a virtual monopoly position.\n\nASML: The Cheapest Real AI Play\n\nInvestors searching for genuine AI exposure often flock to high-profile names like Nvidia. While Nvidia garners headlines and excitement, ASML represents a purer, more foundational play on AI growth yet trades at far more reasonable valuations on a forward basis and facing virtually zero competition. Even in a no growth scenario for 2026, the company still would only be trading at a 28x forward earnings multiple, which is incredibly cheap compared to companies with similar profitability such as NVDA at a ~40, ARM at a 81 PE and AMD at a 37 forward PE albeit with less exceptional profitability metrics.\n\nASML's machines are necessary for creating the chips that power AI workloads. Without ASML's EUV systems, manufacturers cannot economically produce the high-density, high-efficiency chips that AIapplications demand. This makes ASML indispensable not just to AI chip makers but to the broader technological advancement of the entire semiconductor industry.\n\nDespite this strategic importance, ASML's valuation remains relatively undemanding, especially when compared to the sky-high multiples seen in other AI-linked stocks. Investors currently have an opportunity to buy into a company that not only dominates a crucial chokepoint in the semiconductor supply chain but also benefits directly from AI's exponential growth.\n\nA Monopolist State: Safety in Dominance\n\nASML's competitive position is perhaps its most compelling attribute. It effectively holds a monopoly in advanced lithography technology, particularly EUV systems. Developing these machines requires years of research, billions in capital expenditures, and an intricate network of highlyspecialized suppliers. Any new entrant would face monumental hurdles in catching up. Typically monopolistic operations are subject to regulatory scrutiny although the beauty of ASML is, this really is not the case, there is no anti competitive/antitrust actions as the monopoly is simply due to the extreme technological feats of its engineering and IP. The company is also shielded and supported by strategic initiatives via policy and, not only is there no other alternative, the positioning is supported via the agencies that would typically regulate its operations.\n\nThis monopolistic status confers significant pricing power, stability in margins, and a defensible moat against competitors. It also provides resilience against geopolitical shocks. For example, recent concernsover tariffs and trade restrictions are overblown when it comes to ASML. The company's primary customers include Taiwan's TSMC, South Korea's Samsung, and leading European chipmakers not U.S. fabs. The U.S. currently lacks meaningful capacity in advanced lithography-dependent chip manufacturing, so even if tariffs were implemented, they would have a negligible impact on ASML's business and would likely be exempted from tariffs in any matter.\n\nWhy the Selloff is Overdone\n\nThe fact that the stock did not react immediately to the financial report but plunged only after the earnings call suggests that the market's reaction was driven by a knee-jerk interpretation of CEO comments rather than fundamentals. Investors often overreact to management's cautious language without considering the company's actual financial health and market position.\n\nIt's critical to look beyond headline soundbites, ASML's backlog remains robust, and its technology leadership is unchallenged. The company continues to invest in next-generation lithography, including High-NA EUV, which will further cement its dominance in the years ahead.\n\nLooking Ahead: Growth, Not Gloom\n\nWhile ASML's leadership has expressed caution about confirming 2026 growth, this does not imply that growth will not materialize. Rather, it signals responsible management in an environment where macro and geopolitical shifts can change rapidly. The underlying drivers of semiconductor growth AI, cloud computing, data center, and the proliferation of related supply chains remain firmly intact.\n\nMoreover, as chip complexity increases, ASML stands to benefit disproportionately. Every step forward in node shrinkage or chip design intricacy translates into greater reliance on ASML's truly dominant machines.\n\nConclusion: A Buying Opportunity Hidden in Fear\n\n\"Be greedy when others are fearful\"\n\nIn summary, the post-earnings decline in ASML stock represents a classic market overreaction to conservative management commentary rather than a fundamental deterioration in the company's prospects. The CEO's cautious tone was an exercise in responsible disclosure, not a harbinger of decline.\n\nASML remains the linchpin of the semiconductor industry and a foundational enabler of the AI revolution. Its monopoly-like market position, strong technological moat, and strategic importance make it not only a safer semiconductor investment but arguably the most attractive long-term AI infrastructure play available today.\n\nFor investors who can look past the immediate noise and focus on structural trends, this selloff could prove to be an exceptional entry point into a company that is literally in a league of its own.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:27.001976+00:00"}

It's the world's only maker of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, which companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rely on to make the world's most advanced chips.\n\nTypically, being the only producer of a high-tech machine is an advantageous position for a company, and it is for ASML, but it hasn't been enough to make the stock a winner recently. While the rest of the artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor sectors have been soaring, ASML is down sharply from its peak last year. After delivering an underwhelming earnings report on Wednesday, the stock fell again, losing 8.3%, and it's now off 32% from that record last year.\n\nBecause its business involves selling very expensive machines, which can cost around $200 million, ASML's results can be volatile quarter to quarter. In the second quarter, the company reported revenue growth of 23% to 7.69 billion euros. This beat estimates at 7.52 billion euros, though that was down less than 1% in the quarter.\n\nThe company sold 67 new lithography machines, down from 73 in the first quarter. Net bookings were better than expected, increasing from 3.9 billion euros in Q1 to 5.5 billion, a positive growth signal. 2.3 billion euros' worth of those orders were for EUV machines.\n\nFurther down the income statement, profit was also down slightly on a sequential basis. Gross margin fell from 54% to 53.7%, and earnings per share declined from 6.00 euros in Q1 to 5.90.\n\nWhat's ailing ASML\n\nWhile the second-quarter results were in line with estimates, there were some challenges that are outside of the company's control, but continue to plague the business.\n\nFirst, restrictions on exporting semiconductor technology to China have posed a problem for ASML. Management said on the earnings call that it was lowering its backlog by 1.4 billion euros to 33 billion euros due to order cancellations related to those restrictions. That reduction was related to deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines, which are less advanced than the EUV machines it's best known for.\n\nWhat seemed to be more disappointing to investors were its cautious comments about 2026. CEO Roger Dassen said: \"Looking at 2026, we see that our AI customers' fundamentals remain strong. At the same time, we continue to see increasing uncertainty driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Therefore, while we still prepare for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage.\"\n\nEssentially, management is unsure that revenue will grow next year. For the third quarter, the company said it expects 15% revenue growth, to 7.4 billion euros to 7.9 billion euros.\n\nWhat it means for ASML\n\nASML isn't the first tech stock to get dumped by investors for a lack of clarity with its guidance. A number of companies have chosen not to offer guidance due to uncertainty around tariffs, export controls, and volatility in the broader global economy.\n\nArm Holdings did not offer full-year guidance for its new fiscal year in its earnings report in May, and the stock fell as a result. However, that decision wasn't a reflection of weakness, but of uncertainty in both the macroeconomy and with its customer base, which also had not given guidance.\n\nHowever, the strength in AI-related demand is a positive sign for ASML, and investors shouldn't lose sight of long-term tailwinds from AI. For now, ASML is struggling with the vicissitudes of the semiconductor equipment cycle, which operates on a different course than the broader chip sector, but equipment upgrades will come eventually.\n\nAfter Wednesday's sell-off, the stock now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 30, which seems like a fair price to pay for an industry leader with a monopoly in new technology and the potential for accelerating growth from AI. The company continues to expect 44 billion to 60 billion euros in revenue by 2030, and gross margin improving to 56% to 60%.\n\nThat implies double-digit revenue growth and expanding margins. If the company can deliver on that, the stock should be a winner over the next five years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:28.607892+00:00"}

But chances are that you're within reach of a product that ASML helped create. Modern computers, mobile devices, and even cars wouldn't be possible without one very important thing -- lithography -- and ASML dominates that market.\n\nThe company's dominance in lithography -- which I'll explain momentarily -- has led to good returns for shareholders over the last decade. ASML stock is up more than 600% during this time, compared to a 200% return for the S&P 500. However, while long-term returns have been stellar, the company's recent returns haven't been so hot.\n\nOn July 16, ASML reported financial results for its second quarter of 2025, and the stock dropped about 8% in a day. In short, investors didn't like something they heard. Referring to its potential growth in 2026, CEO Christophe Fouquet said, \"We cannot confirm it at this stage,\" due to all of the macro-economic uncertainty. That's all it took to spook investors.\n\nHowever, there's something that ASML investors appear to be overlooking: The company quietly just booked billions for its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. And that's hugely important context when thinking about ASML's future.\n\nASML is still booking billions\n\nIn the semiconductor space, everything is getting smaller and more complex, which leads to the need for more complex machines. That's where ASML comes in. It makes advanced lithography machines that have a near monopoly in the market. Companies making microchips need ASML's machines.\n\nThere are a variety of ASML machines that use different processes, but the best-selling line is its EUV machines, which accounted for 48% of Q2 net system sales. The extreme ultraviolet light's wavelength is short enough to work on the world's smallest chips.\n\nASML's Q2 numbers looked good. Q2 net sales of 7.7 billion euros were above expectations. And earnings per share (EPS) of 5.9 euros were also higher than expected.\n\nBoth of these outperformances were relatively modest. By contrast, analysts only expected ASML's net bookings to be around 4.2 billion euros, whereas it reported Q2 net bookings of 5.5 billion euros -- a roughly a 30% beat. (Bookings are when the company receives an order in writing. By comparison, net sales refers to when a machine is delivered or installed.)\n\nKeep in mind that a single EUV machine from ASML can cost around $280 million, so it doesn't take too many surprise orders to swing bookings in a big way. Still, the 30% outperformance does suggest ongoing health in the semiconductor manufacturing space.\n\nSo what's the problem?\n\nSemiconductor manufacturers are almost guaranteed to spend significant money in the coming years as trends such as artificial intelligence (AI), driverless cars, and renewable energy will drive demand more than ever. Manufacturers will need to spend on equipment to increase supply. It's not so much a question of \"if\" as \"when.\"\n\nHowever, capital expenditures could be delayed because executives are waiting until uncertainty dies down. With ever-changing tariffs, companies can't predict what expenses will be. It's better to wait for the dust to settle, if possible.\n\nThis is what Fouquet was referring to with his prediction for ASML's business in 2026. Its products still dominate the market, and its customers will still need them. But will they buy in 2026 or later? That's what management is unsure of and why the stock dipped.\n\nThis could be an opportunity for investors who take a longer-term view on ASML stock. As the chart below shows, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31 is well below its 10-year average valuation.\n\nLooking ahead to 2030, ASML's outlook hasn't changed. By 2030, it believes it will generate revenue of 44 billion euros to 60 billion euros. For perspective, the company expects to generate revenue of about 32.5 billion euros this year.\n\nAssuming it hits the midpoint of its 2030 guidance, ASML will generate revenue of 52 billion euros in five years. That's growth of 60%, which is pretty good. Factoring in the company's dividend and stock buyback program, ASML stock could be a market-beating investment.\n\nThe good thing for investors considering ASML stock today is its safety. Granted, it's possible for another company to develop a machine that makes ASML's own obsolete -- anything is possible. But ASML is considered to be well ahead of the competition in an important market, which gives its business strong profits margins. This has helped to create a strong balance sheet.\n\nIn conclusion, I think ASML stock is unlikely to lose money for investors over the next five years. The business is too strong, and its products are too important. But the timing of orders could cause the stock to drop at times, like it has now. For long-term investors who believe in the company's 2030 outlook, these drops in stock price could be opportunistic entry points.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:30.105556+00:00"}

With a virtual monopoly on the technology needed to create advanced chips, the sell-off looks like a buying opportunity.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/21/asml-shares-tumble-time-to-run-for-the-hills/", "published_at": "2025-07-21T10:30:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Shares of ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) sank after the company warned it was uncertain about its growth outlook for 2026. The stock has fallen about 30% over the past year, as of this writing.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with ASML, the Dutch company is a semiconductor equipment manufacturer that makes the devices that foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, use to make chips. It has a virtual monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is the manufacturing process used create advanced chips, such as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe company has also developed a new technology called a high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet lithography system, or High NA EUV, to help shrink nodes. Nodes represent the size of the transistors used on a chip, and foundries and chipmakers are continually looking to shrink node sizes, as that makes the chips more powerful and energy-efficient. However, the cost of ASML's new High NA EUV machines is around $400 million each, which has led customers to push back.\n\nAn uncertain 2026 outlook\n\nASML's Q2 results were actually quite strong. Revenue for the quarter jumped 23% to 7.7 billion euros ($9 billion) and came in at the high end of the company's guidance range of 7.2 billion to 7.7 billion euros ($8.4 billion to $9 billion). Its equipment sales rose nearly 18% year over year to 5.6 billion euros ($6.5 billion), while its service revenue soared 42% to 2.1 billion euros ($2.5 billion).\n\nDuring the quarter, the company sold 67 new lithography systems and nine used systems compared to 89 new and 11 used systems in the year-ago quarter. However, 48% of its sales came from higher-priced EUV technology versus only 31% a year ago, as it had a large percentage of sales to China a year ago.\n\nThe company said that growth is being driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and that more customers are shifting toward EUV technology. It sees its customers looking to increase their EUV capacity by 30% this year. Overall, it is looking for a 15% increase in revenue in 2025, with a sustained improvement of its service business in the second half. It noted that the direct and the indirect impact of tariffs remains uncertain, and that it's navigating the situation the best it can.\n\nIts net bookings, which can be a good indicator of future revenue growth, were solid, coming in at 5.5 billion euros ($6.4 billion). That was well ahead of the 4.2 billion euros ($4.9 billion) in net bookings that analysts were expecting. However, its Q3 guidance calling for revenue of between 7.4 billion euros ($8.6 billion) and 7.9 billion euros ($9.2 billion) was below the analyst consensus of 8.3 billion euros ($9.7 billion).\n\nLooking toward 2026, the company continues to expect strong demand coming from AI. However, given the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment -- along with some companies dealing with company-specific issues that could impact the timing of their capital expenditure (capex) -- it is unclear what its growth next year might look like.\n\nShould investors buy the dip?\n\nWhile ASML's Q2 results were strong, investors were clearly disappointed with the company's commentary about 2026. To be fair, the semiconductor equipment business is notoriously lumpy. A few large foundries make up the bulk of its EUV business, while Chinese companies had been rushing to get their lower-end equipment on fears it too would be banned in the country. Meanwhile, Intel and Samsung, two of the world's largest foundries, have had their share of struggles, which could be leading to some of the uncertainty with regard to next year.\n\nThat said, I view the sell-off in ASML shares as a buying opportunity. The company basically has a 100% market share when it comes to the EUV technology that is needed to make advanced chips. And with demand for advanced chips continuing to grow, foundries are going to need EUV machines to make them. Meanwhile, while leading foundry TSMC has balked at the high price of ASML's new High NA EUV machines, it cannot afford to delay their use indefinitely, as the cost of falling behind technologically would be much worse.\n\nFollowing the market sell-off, ASML shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 27x based on 2025 analyst estimates. With nearly no competition for EUV lithography and growing demand for advanced chips, this is a stock you'd want to own at these levels for the long term.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:33.987651+00:00"}

However, through a combination of factors, I think there could be multiple stocks that pass Palantir over the coming years.\n\nThree that I think have that chance are ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%), International Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), and Salesforce (CRM -0.53%), but this list could grow if the market comes to its senses regarding Palantir's stock.\n\nPalantir's stock appears to be significantly overvalued\n\nPalantir has been on an absolute tear since the start of 2024, rising nearly 800%. However, its revenue only grew 39% year over year in the first quarter, indicating a significant disparity between stock price appreciation and actual business growth.\n\nThis shows up in the stock's valuation, which trades for 113 times sales and 244 times forward earnings.\n\nVery few companies ever reach this valuation for good reason: It's nearly impossible to live up to expectations. If we use a five-year timeline to examine Palantir's stock, let's make the following assumptions:\n\nRevenue growth of 40%.\n\nProfit margin reaches 30%.\n\nShare count remains flat.\n\nThose are three incredibly bullish assumptions -- the company hasn't achieved 40% year-over-year growth in recent quarters and would have to sustain that for five years. Also, a 30% profit margin would place it among the best software companies, and its current 18% margin is still a considerable distance from that level.\n\nLastly, management is notorious for issuing a large number of shares to employees, and its share count has increased by 7.3% since the start of 2024, indicating significant dilution.\n\nRegardless, if these heady assumptions could come true, Palantir would generate $16.8 billion in revenue and $5 billion in profits. That's huge growth from today's $3.1 billion in revenue, but it would still value the company at 67 times hypothetical 2030 earnings.\n\nA 67 multiple for forward earnings makes for a very expensive stock, and Nvidia, which is consistently growing faster than Palantir, has only a 38 forward earnings multiple right now.\n\nI think this is a fairly clear-cut case that Palantir is drastically overvalued at today's levels. Even with the most bullish assumptions, Palantir's stock would still appear overvalued five years from now, even if the company achieves incredible growth figures.\n\nAs a result, I believe the stock is ripe for a decline, and there are many other stocks (beyond the ones I mentioned) that could surpass Palantir.\n\nThis trio has a strong outlook and significantly cheaper prices\n\nASML is only slightly behind Palantir's $362 billion market cap, with a valuation of $292 billion at the time of this writing. It is a key provider of machinery in chip manufacturing, and it holds a technological monopoly with its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines.\n\nAs more chip fabrication facilities emerge to support the huge AI demand, the company will experience strong growth, which management has told investors to expect in 2026. As a result, I think ASML could easily surpass Palantir.\n\nIBM is a legacy computing business that's working to make the pivot into AI and quantum computing, which is forecast to see commercial adoption around 2030. If it becomes the go-to for this technology, the stock could be ripe for huge upside from its current $266 billion valuation.\n\nLastly, Salesforce dominates in customer relationship management software. It's also working to integrate AI into its product and maximize its profitability. Compared to many stocks on the market, it is relatively cheap and is valued at a lower level than the S&P 500, which trades for 23.7 times forward earnings.\n\nAs a final note, all three of these stocks trade for far less than Palantir's hypothetical 2030 valuation, which should be a sign for investors that the stock is unsustainably expensive. There is a near-endless list of stocks that appear to be better investments, and these three are among them.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:35.627480+00:00"}

The power of compound interest is magical when applied over decades and is the most widely used method to build wealth in the modern world.\n\nDon't let your money depreciate in a bank account. Buy stocks to invest for the long term instead. The only question is: What stocks should you buy today?\n\nIf you have $100,000 in savings, invest your money into these three stocks and wait a decade. You might just have $1 million in 10 years' time.\n\nASML's market lock\n\nA monopoly player in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, ASML (ASML 2.81%) makes lithography machines that enable manufacturers to build advanced computer chips. Complex lithography machines use lasers to enable the printing and layering of computer chips with transistors barely a few nanometers apart, which is the key to efficient and powerful computing.\n\nAfter years of development, ASML was the first company to offer extreme ultraviolet lithography. No company -- or country, for that matter -- has been able to crack the code ever since. This means that semiconductor makers have only one vendor from which they can buy machines that let them build advanced computer chips, giving ASML a monopoly.\n\nWith the rise of AI, advanced computer chips are becoming more important by the day as companies race to build AI at scale. Nvidia is one of the key beneficiaries of ASML's technologies; without these machines, its computer chips would be much slower.\n\nWith AI spending growing like gangbusters, computer chip manufacturers are going to need more ASML machines to service this rising demand. Even though the company is already at $33 billion in trailing revenue, I think these sales figures can grow substantially over the next decade because of the hundreds of billions of dollars (perhaps trillions, at the end of the day) that will be spent on computer chips for AI.\n\nASML has fantastic profit margins because of its monopoly power, which means this soaring revenue will lead to huge earnings gains. In turn, this will produce strong stock returns for ASML shareholders.\n\nGoogle's AI leadership\n\nAnother AI beneficiary -- and reason for ASML's rise -- is Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%). The technology giant is in a better position than anyone to take advantage of AI, which many technologists think will be more valuable than the internet.\n\nWhy is Alphabet in such a great position? It has distribution with billions of existing customers using its products like Google, YouTube, and Google Maps. It has a data advantage to train its AI tools in Google, YouTube, and Google Workspace. It has the best infrastructure for training and deploying AI compute because of its custom-built computer chips and Google Cloud infrastructure.\n\nAcross the board, perhaps no single company is better equipped than Alphabet to bring AI to the masses.\n\nEven though Alphabet is already such a large business with $117 billion in annual operating income and a market cap of $2.2 trillion, I think AI will enable it to generate fantastic gains for shareholders over the next decade. Google Search is still humming along with new avenues for monetizing AI features, Google Cloud is growing revenue 28% year over year, and YouTube has a long runway to expand its monetization. Don't forget the self-driving taxi network Waymo, which is experiencing blistering growth across the United States.\n\nAdd it all up, and Alphabet is a stock you'll want to bet on for the next 10 years.\n\nAirbnb's global expansion\n\nAI may suck all of the oxygen from investing conversations these days, but there are still other stocks enjoying long-term tailwinds. Airbnb (ABNB 2.76%) is a travel disrupter with a lot of room to run over the next 10 years.\n\nMany readers may know Airbnb as the travel platform for booking rooms and homes for trips around the globe. Customers spend close to $100 billion a year on lodging through Airbnb.\n\nHowever, what many readers may not know is that the majority of Airbnb's bookings are made in just a few countries such as the United States, Australia, and France. Management believes geographic expansion is a huge opportunity for Airbnb as it localizes the service for different countries such as Japan.\n\nGrowth in new markets was double original markets last quarter. For example, Brazil's nights booked grew 27% year over year in the first quarter.\n\nSecond, Airbnb is moving beyond lodging, launching its revamped Experiences and Services tabs on the application recently. These are offerings such as massages, tour guides, and cooking classes that travelers may want to add to purchases. Airbnb aims to become a one-stop shop for travelers, building an ecosystem of marketplace services that will grow its addressable market.\n\nIt is early days, but these geographic expansions and new product offerings should give Airbnb a long runway to grow in the years to come. It is not like its original service won't grow either, as Airbnb keeps taking market share from traditional travel applications. With a market cap of $85.5 billion, Airbnb is a large but not gargantuan technology company, and I think it can help make shareholders rich if they buy today and hold for the next decade.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:41.612520+00:00"}

Previously, ASML Holding had expected demand to keep rising, especially with AI fueling more chip production. However, on the second-quarter call, the company said that it “cannot confirm growth in 2026,” pointing to customer hesitation and ongoing market uncertainty.\n\nDuring the call, ASML Holding acknowledged that ongoing U.S.-China tariff discussions, including the Section 232 tariff review, are negatively impacting customer capital spending timelines. This hesitation may delay orders and revenue recognition in late 2025 and into 2026, casting doubt on near-term growth continuity.\n\nAdditionally, ASML Holding issued disappointing guidance for the third quarter. The company expects third-quarter revenues between €7.4 billion and €7.9 billion. As per the Euro/USD currency exchange rate as of July 16, the top-line guidance ranges from $8.6 billion to $9.2 billion, significantly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.81 billion.\n\nASML expects the third-quarter gross margin in the 50-52% range, depicting a significant decline from 53.7% in the second quarter. This sequential decline is expected mainly due to margin-dilutive High NA system revenues and fewer upgrade orders.\n\nAll these factors have caused near-term uncertainty about ASML Holding’s prospects. However, considering the growing AI-driven demand for advanced chip-making tools, the company’s long-term prospects seem bright, making the stock worth holding.\n\nEUV Technology Keeps ASML in a Strong Position\n\nASML Holding’s dominance in the semiconductor manufacturing sector is unchallenged. The company maintains a near-monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is essential for producing advanced chips at 3nm and below.

The continent’s largest companies are increasingly outpaced by their US counterparts—particularly in the rapidly evolving technological sector.\n\nWhile the broader European equity market has outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, the continent’s corporate heavyweights are falling behind in the global stock market hierarchy. The gap highlights a deeper transatlantic divide in innovation, private capital, and long-term competitiveness.\n\nAs of mid-July, the combined market capitalisation of Europe’s seven largest listed firms — SAP, Novo Nordisk, Hermès, ASML, LVMH, Roche and Nestlé — stands at $2.2 trillion (€1.73tr), virtually flat year-to-date.\n\nThat puts the combined market cap of US 7 largest companies at $18,8 trillion vs. of EU’s largest.\n\nBy contrast, the US ‘Magnificent Seven’ — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Broadcom (instead of Tesla) — have reached a cumulative valuation of $18.8tr (€16.12tr), up 10.2% since the start of the year.\n\nTech dominance defines the US-EU divergence\n\nThe divergence reflects the central role of technology and artificial intelligence in today’s equity market leadership.\n\nSeven out of seven of the largest US companies are technology firms with significant exposure to AI infrastructure, cloud computing or data platforms.\n\nIn Europe, just two companies in the top seven — SAP and ASML — are active in the technology sector, with the remainder concentrated in luxury goods, pharmaceuticals and consumer staples.\n\nNvidia alone is valued at €3.59 trillion, larger than the combined market cap of Europe’s top seven. Its dominance is tied to its role in powering AI infrastructure worldwide, from model training to real-time inference.\n\n“While the others use AI to power their platforms and services, Nvidia supplies the very foundation on which those ambitions are built,” said Natalie Hwang, founder of Apeira Capital, in an emailed comment.\n\n“It quietly enables the success of every other member of the Magnificent Seven, while remaining their most indispensable partner.”\n\nAccording to industry estimates, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are set to spend over $320 billion (€294 billion) on AI infrastructure in 2025, much of it focused on inference optimisation and hyperscale data centres.\n\nJP Morgan Chase's message to Europe: 'You’re losing'\n\nJP Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon reinforced the broader concerns over Europe’s global position during remarks at a recent event in Dublin hosted by the Irish foreign ministry.\n\n“Europe has gone from 90% of US GDP to 65% over 10 or 15 years. That’s not good,” Dimon said. “You’re losing.”\n\nHe pointed to overregulation, fragmentation, and weak productivity as structural weaknesses, and urged European leaders to act on the 2024 report led by former ECB President Mario Draghi, which recommended €800 billion in annual investment to strengthen industrial competitiveness.\n\nDimon added: “We’ve got this huge, strong market and our companies are big and successful, have huge kinds of scale that are global. You have that, but less and less.”\n\nA moment of reckoning\n\nThe diverging fortunes of the Magnificent Seven and Europe’s corporate champions symbolise a broader transatlantic imbalance—not just in technology, but in economic dynamism.\n\nWhile Europe’s top firms are respected global brands, they are increasingly eclipsed by American companies that are not only growing faster but also shaping the future. The AI race has become a litmus test for global economic relevance.\n\nIf Europe is to keep pace, it must resolve its innovation shortfall, energise private investment, and modernise regulation.\n\nOtherwise, as Dimon put it bluntly: “You’re losing.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:50.496210+00:00"}

Alphabet should not be overlooked for what the company is doing in AI.  Artificial intelligence (AI) isn't just a technology trend -- it's transforming the word we live in.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/18/artificial-intelligence-stocks-you-can-buy-hold/", "published_at": "2025-07-18T08:30:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) isn't just a technology trend -- it's transforming the word we live in. As such, investing in leading AI companies for the long haul could be a smart move.\n\nLet's look at five AI stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWhen it comes to AI infrastructure, Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) is the clear leader. Its graphic processing units (GPUs) are the main chips used to train and run AI workloads. The company had an over 90% market share in the GPU market in Q1, while its data center revenue has jumped more than 9x over the past two years. That kind of growth from a $4.17 trillion company is almost unheard of.\n\nThe company's wide moat comes from its CUDA software platform, which it pushed into universities and research labs long before AI became mainstream. As a result, CUDA became the primary platform on which developers learned to program GPUs, and a plethora of libraries and tools were built on top of its software to help optimize the performance of its chips for AI.\n\nOutside of AI, Nvidia's auto segment is also seeing strong growth. Revenue hit $567 million last quarter, with the company projecting $5 billion for the year. With the advent of autonomous driving, this could become another big growth leg for the company in the future.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nToday, most chipmakers don't manufacture their own chips; they just design them. That is where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) steps in. It is the world's leading semiconductor contract manufacturer, making chips for leading chip designers like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, and Broadcom.\n\nManufacturing advanced chips isn't an easy process, as it requires both scale and technological expertise. Foundries are constantly racing to shrink node sizes, as the more transistors that can be packed onto a chip, the better a chip's performance and power efficiency.\n\nTSMC has a wide lead in advanced node manufacturing. Chips built on 7nm and smaller nodes made up 73% of revenue last quarter, while 3nm chips alone accounted for 22%. Apple has already locked in future supply for its 2nm line.\n\nAs rivals have struggled, TSMC has become a vital partner to leading chip designers. This has given it pricing power, as chip designers work closely with the company to secure future capacity to meet growing demand for advanced chips.\n\n3. ASML\n\nWhile TSMC manufactures advanced chips, ASML (ASML 2.81%) is the company that provides the equipment that makes it possible. It has a near-monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography, which is the technology used to make advanced chips.\n\nASML's business is driven by chipmaker capital spending. With TSMC and Intel planning to invest hundreds of billions into new capacity, ASML will benefit. As long as demand for advanced chips keeps rising, it should continue to see solid demand moving forward.\n\nThe company also recently introduced a new technology called a high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet lithography system, or High NA EUV. This technology will help shrink chip sizes even further. While TSMC has balked at these machines' nearly $400 million price tag, last quarter it shipped its fifth High NA EUV system. It now has machines placed at the three largest semiconductor contract manufacturers, and none of them are likely going to want to fall behind.\n\nWith companies looking to design more powerful AI chips in the future, ASML looks well-positioned for the long run.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (META 3.16%) owns one of the most powerful digital ad platforms in the world, and AI is making it better. Its Llama model is increasing personalization and engagement across Facebook and Instagram, which is driving strong revenue growth. In Q1, its ad impressions rose 5%, while pricing climbed 10%. That's a strong sign that users are spending more time on its apps, and that advertisers are getting more value from the platform.\n\nMeta's new AI tools are helping marketers generate better creative content and target users more effectively. That makes campaigns better and increases return on ad spend, which keeps advertisers coming back. Meta is also investing heavily in its AI infrastructure, giving it more control over performance and cost.\n\nThe company is also just starting to serve ads on both its messaging platform, WhatsApp, and its new social media site, Threads. WhatsApp has more than 3 billion users, and Threads has already hit 350 million. As such, both have a long runway of ad growth ahead.\n\nOverall, Meta looks well-positioned for an AI world.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOGL 1.14%) moat should not be underestimated. While investors fear that AI will disrupt its core search business, investors are missing what Google truly does. Google isn't about search; it's about content discovery, and whether that is delivered via traditional search or AI, the company has a few big advantages.\n\nIts biggest advantage is distribution. Its Chrome browser has a more than 65% browser market share, while its Android operating system runs on more than 70% of smartphones. It's also the default search engine on Apple devices and partners with other browsers like Opera. The company also has decades of user search data and the world's largest ad network, with unprecedented scale and reach.\n\nImportantly, Google is integrating AI into products people already use. Its new AI Mode in search turns Google into an AI assistant, not just a list of links. A recent Oppenheimer survey showed 82% of users found it more helpful than traditional search, and 75% said it was more useful than ChatGPT. That's a strong signal that Google is getting this right.\n\nIts cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, is also gaining momentum. Q1 revenue rose 28%, and operating income more than doubled. Cloud customers are using Google's Vertex AI tools to train and deploy models. It even has developed its own custom AI chips, which even OpenAI has been testing.\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo is another underappreciated asset. It's now running over 250,000 paid robotaxi rides per week and has started expanding into new markets through its Uber partnership. Alphabet's Willow quantum chip is also showing real progress in reducing error rates. This may take years to play out, but it could be another growth engine down the road.\n\nOverall, with its combination of leading and emerging businesses, Alphabet looks like one of the best AI stocks to own over the long term.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:18:52.106916+00:00"}

That reinforced expectations that tech firms from Meta Platforms Inc. to Google will keep spending to build the data centers essential to artificial intelligence development. TSMC’s American depositary receipts gained as much as 4.3% after markets opened in New York, while top supplier ASML Holding NV rose as much as 3.5%.\n\nTSMC’s move underscores resilient demand for high-end chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which is outpacing its production capacity. Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei affirmed on Thursday that AI orders still run hot — seeking to dispel persistent speculation that tech firms may curtail spending. While he stressed that underlying AI demand is strengthening, the uncertainty around the Trump administration’s tariffs merited caution.\n\nThis is “supporting the AI value chain, and AI optimism still holds,” said Billy Leung, investment strategist at Global X ETFs in Sydney. “For investors, TSMC results again ease fears of an AI slowdown. Margins hold, demand outlook good, generally reinforces the AI buildout is still well underway.”\n\nInvestors have piled back into AI-linked companies, shaking off a funk that settled in after China’s DeepSeek cast doubt on whether the likes of Amazon.com Inc. needed to spend that much money on data centers.\n\nLast week, Nvidia became the first company in history to hit a $4 trillion valuation, underscoring investors’ renewed enthusiasm for companies like TSMC that are key to building the infrastructure for AI.\n\nTSMC wasn’t hiking its outlook on news the US is prepared to grant Nvidia licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, Wei told reporters. While that resumption in sales was positive for the industry, it was too early to quantify the impact, he added.\n\nA day before TSMC’s results, ASML triggered anxiety across markets by walking back its own growth forecast for 2026.

Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi just did something that’s making jaws drop: He convinced regulators in China and the U.S. to approve the company’s $35 billion acquisition of Ansys that’s set to close today. The reaction from fellow CEOs, he told me: “How did you get one of the most complex deals done in such a complex time?”\n\nWith tensions high, the business case for bringing together two U.S. tech companies making products critical for Chinese clients wasn’t going to sell itself. “I’ve been to China maybe eight times this year,” he said. “I found myself being a U.S. ambassador to China, explaining the Synopsys position and understanding what they care about. And, back in the U.S., representing the importance and need for us as a global company to continue leading with innovation.”\n\nThe tough part wasn’t the antitrust review of a $6.1 billion-a-year leader in chip design’s bid to buy a $2.5 billion-a-year leader in engineering software, he said. It was negotiating “access to the technology in the event things happen between the two countries.” What helped was “overwhelming customer support” and a recognition among Chinese regulators that “if they were too difficult or too constraining, it’s not good for China.” (The Federal Trade Commission had granted conditional approval in May.)\n\nHis advice for others trying to win over authorities in both markets? “From the beginning, the message was consistent with the U.S. and with China: I’m not a politician. I represent a global company with opportunities that we see across every region,” he said. “With China in particular, I believe they have a great opportunity to take their strength in manufacturing and take it to the next level of intelligent manufacturing. And the U.S. has many, many other strengths with compute, software applications, etc. It’s important for Synopsys to have access to both markets to continue leading.”\n\nAnd it mattered that he went to China to speak with officials himself. “I was not getting an update once a month on how things are going. Did I have moments where it was depressing, leaving a meeting and seeing all kinds of surprises happening out of our control? Of course. At the end of May, we had a complete blackout and restriction on selling to China. That was a tough moment. I happened to be in China the week after, having to explain it, not knowing how long these uncertainties will be. I never doubted we’d get it done, but I started doubting the timing.”\n\n\n\nContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:19:07.317764+00:00"}

A: Roger Dassen, CFO, explained that the expected EUV growth for the year is about 30%, down from an initial higher estimate. The difference is due to a shift in revenue from system sales to the upgrade business, as many tools shipped at lower configurations are being upgraded to full capacity, which is accounted for in the installed base business rather than system sales.\n\nQ: How does ASML price its tools, and is there a difference in value between multi-patterning Low NA and single High NA EUV? A: Christophe Fouquet, CEO, confirmed that ASML prices its tools based on the value provided to customers, including productivity and performance improvements. High NA EUV offers significant value by simplifying processes and enabling further node advancements, which can justify higher pricing compared to multi-patterning Low NA EUV.\n\nQ: What impact does the potential removal of export bans on AI chips to China have on ASML? A: Roger Dassen noted that while it may not directly result in a significant increase in tool sales, the removal of export bans is positive for the broader ecosystem, potentially strengthening global reach and benefiting ASML indirectly.\n\nQ: How does ASML view the current uncertainty around tariffs and its impact on 2026 growth projections? A: Christophe Fouquet and Roger Dassen highlighted that ongoing tariff discussions create uncertainty, affecting customer investment decisions. This uncertainty has led ASML to be more cautious about confirming growth for 2026, despite strong underlying demand driven by AI.\n\nQ: What are the key milestones for High NA EUV adoption, and how is the program progressing? A: Christophe Fouquet stated that the current focus is on qualifying the technology with the EXE:5000 system. The next phase involves ensuring tool maturity for high-volume manufacturing, with the EXE:5200 system being a critical step. The program is progressing well, with positive customer feedback on performance.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:19:09.367497+00:00"}

Meanwhile, shares of larger rival Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.KS) rose 2.3%.\n\nAs the key supplier of high-bandwidth memory to Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), SK Hynix has seen its shares soar in the past couple years on voracious investor appetite for anything linked to artificial intelligence. While Samsung has lagged in getting its HBM chips approved by Nvidia, observers are watching for signs of a catch-up that would dent SK Hynix’s lucrative advantage.\n\n“We believe HBM pricing could decline for the first time in 2026, with increasing competition and pricing power gradually shifting to the major customer where Hynix has an outsized exposure,” the Goldman analysts wrote in a note.\n\nWhile the AI theme has shown a resurgence of late, helping Nvidia become the first company to reach a market value of $4 trillion, the market is alert to signs of any trouble. The decline in SK Hynix shares got extra momentum from a slide in global chip stocks following a cautious outlook from ASML Holding NV (ASML), another key company in the Nvidia supply chain.\n\nThe Goldman analysts said SK Hynix’s share price has continued to “substantially” outperform the market despite growing risks. The stock is up 57% so far this year, outpacing Samsung’s 23% gain.\n\n“For several years, foreign investors have largely maintained a ‘Hynix long/Samsung short’ stance within the semis sector, however, it seems sentiment is shifting,” said Cho Junkee, an analyst at SK Securities Co. in Seoul. “Samsung is now being picked up, and some are beginning to revise their preferences.”\n\nGoldman’s rating cut follows a downgrade earlier this week by Mirae Asset Securities Co., which said SK Hynix’s HBM market share may begin to slip after next-generation chips begin shipping next year.

You know, not to harp on it 'cause we were just talked about tariffs and trade deals and that uncertainty, but it's kind of a cover if you want to think about it, right? If If you're a company and you're planning whether it's your capital spending budget, or your outlook for how what consumers are going to do, whether or not others will be, you know, taking your products, you don't really know the landscape. You can see the data, but this tariff uncertainty is just amping up questions that you just don't have the answers to right now. And I've been thinking that this earnings season, more companies than not are likely to guide more conservatively because we don't know that. I'm a little concerned about where the S&P 500 is, right? Earnings expectations come down. That either means the market comes down or the multiple goes higher. And at what point do people start to question the market valuation?\n\n02:18 Speaker A\n\nTo your point, the CFO of the company saying customers, I thought this was interesting.

I mean, you know, again, Trump has kind of pushed it down, and we've got now 30%, 35%, potentially higher. How do you plan in that environment if you don't? Because you don't know if that's going to be it. Could it be something else? Could it be even higher, you know? If something happens and Trump says, \"Ah, we're gonna do this.\" So it's a very uncertain time, hard to plan for.\n\n03:31 Speaker A\n\nAll right, let's turn to another one. Now with Palantir, that stock getting a lift at Mizuho, the firm highlighting a bright spot for revenue growth. So Mizuho upgrades this one, they go to neutral, right? And here's what they say, Chris, they say, \"While checks on Palantir's business are very limited, we heard we heard that enterprise inbound activity rose materially. We anticipate ongoing strong AI adoption in the US.\" We believe Palantir has a legitimate chance, they say, to accelerate total revenue growth for growth for a fifth consecutive quarter.\n\n04:22 Chris\n\nYeah, that's why That's why we own the stock in the pro portfolio at the street. That's why we bought it in, you know, around 70, 75 on that pullback earlier in the year. What confounds me, though, is an upgrade to a neutral with a price target that is lower than where the stock is. Doesn't seem to make sense. Uh, if I were to sift through it, put my buy-side hat on, sounds like you missed it, and he's kind of trying to catch up.\n\n05:15 Speaker A\n\nUh they They acknowledge they call it a sky-high valuation, is how they put it, Chris. But the robo robust growth story appears intact. Their target looks like 135. To your point, the stock has been of course a monster.\n\n05:43 Chris\n\nYeah, it has. It has. I I honestly think, Josh, that you're saying, \"Wow, we see big growth out there, but we're concerned about the value.\" You're talking out of both sides of your mouth. Which one is it?\n\n06:01 Speaker A\n\nGot a call. All right, lastly, Arm Holdings is getting an upgrade at BNP Paribas, citing potential upside from ASIC chips. Uh so they upgrade this one to outperform, their target's 120. What do you make of that one, Chris?\n\n06:24 Chris\n\nUh again, little late to the party on this one.\n\n06:29 Speaker A\n\nBig move off the IPO, though.\n\n06:31 Chris\n\nOh, oh, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, you know, look, we're going into the seasonally strongest part of the year for their key end markets. Um they are trying to move more into data centers. So it does make sense that, you know, you want to be where the growth is going into the second half of the year. Personally, I prefer Nvidia, Marvell, and Qualcomm over this, but that's just me.\n\n07:00 Speaker A\n\nTo your point, the analyst does say here, there are still significant upside to be had.

The drop wiped out over $30 billion in market value and sent shockwaves through global tech markets, as investors digested the implications for the broader semiconductor and AI industries.\n\nThe selloff followed ASML’s second-quarter earnings report, which beat expectations on revenue and net profit, with robust bookings of $6.4 billion. However, CEO Christophe Fouquet’s comments overshadowed the strong results: “While we still prepare for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage,” he said, citing escalating macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, especially the threat of new tariffs on semiconductor equipment.\n\nSmart money watches ASML for signals on the tech cycle’s health; a growth warning here may be the market’s early clue that the AI and semiconductor supercycle is reaching a plateau—or at least preparing for turbulence.\n\nWhy ASML’s outlook matters more than most\n\nThis isn’t just a company-specific event—it could be a canary in the coal mine for the global tech and AI ecosystem. Why? ASML is the world’s exclusive supplier of EUV lithography machines—the ultra-precise fabrication equipment that makes cutting-edge semiconductors possible. Every state-of-the-art AI accelerator, every data-center chip that powers generative AI, traces its technological lineage back to ASML’s tools.\n\nSo when ASML tells the market it “cannot confirm” growth for 2026—despite beating on current earnings—it’s signaling not just caution about its own pipeline, but a potential inflection point in the most future-critical segment of the electronics supply chain. In other words: if ASML’s order book slows, it means that downstream chipmakers may anticipate softer demand, have rising uncertainty about capex returns, or are bracing for policy headwinds.\n\nThe context matters: This is a moment when AI demand has been surging, but in 2025 it’s now colliding with macro uncertainty, particularly driven by U.S.-EU tariff threats, China export restrictions, and capex fatigue after a historic tech investment wave. ASML’s lead times are 12 to 18 months—with orders today reflecting confidence in global chip demand well into 2026. If that confidence is wavering, it ripples through the entire innovation economy.\n\nASML is not just another tech stock—it is the linchpin of the global semiconductor supply chain. The company is the world’s sole supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, the critical technology that enables the production of the most advanced chips used in everything from AI accelerators to smartphones and data centers.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:19:30.078096+00:00"}

Joining me now, Patrick Moorhead, Moore Insights strategy, founder, CEO and chief analyst. Patrick, it's good to see you. So, um, you know, ASML maker of these lithography machines that are basically crucial in the chip making process here. They're seen usually as sort of a bellwether or an indicator. So, what does it tell us that they are seeing this tariff risk and in their inability to give better guidance?\n\n00:48 Patrick Moorhead\n\nYeah, so this one's very straightforward. Uh, essentially with tariffs, you might have a US chip manufacturer, an Intel, a Samsung, uh, a TSMC, who might have to pay 20 to 30% more for a machine that's a couple hundred million dollars. And what they're doing is they're holding back and waiting to see what happens. I I think this is a short-term issue. The administration put a moratorium on ship tariffs, but they didn't put a moratorium on ship manufacturing tariffs, which is a bit ironic given the administration's desire to want to have more uh, homegrown chip manufacturers. So, it's literally playing against itself right now, but I think cooler heads will prevail at the White House and I think we'll see some relief.\n\n02:15 Speaker A\n\nWell, and I mean, you you're the perfect person to ask about this stuff, Patrick, because you really understand these supply chains. I mean, to to take the other side of the point you were just making, like the the ground is only just being broken, and in some cases not even that, on some of the chip manufacturing um, facilities in the US. Like, what's the lead time on an ASML machine if if you're going to order one?\n\n03:02 Patrick Moorhead\n\nGosh, the lead time on an EUV machine could be six to nine months. The good news is that there's a lot of working process. They don't not start building until they get the order. They have a good idea of uh, through their customer forecast what they're going to need. And I would guarantee you that uh, TSMC has a demand. Uh, sure ground uh, machines aren't being pulled into the Intel, new Intel facility in Columbus, Ohio, but facilities in Taylor, Texas with Samsung, uh, and in Arizona with TSMC, uh, will require these machines to be able to build chips for companies like AMD, for companies like uh, Nvidia that have already signed pretty large deals with uh, TSMC in Arizona, including Apple.\n\n04:35 Speaker A\n\nGot it. Okay. So, eventually the you think these orders are going to come through. Um, you mentioned Nvidia, so let's turn to that company, right? It seems like Jensen Wong is taking a bit of a victory tour in China, um, after getting signals from the US government that they're going to be able to sell the H20 chips there again. Um, is there a risk though? I mean, they're they're basically at in the political crosshairs here. So, how are you thinking about his ability to navigate that? Because, you know, he only has so much control over the company's destiny in that way.\n\n05:52 Patrick Moorhead\n\nYeah, Jensen's in an interesting spot, right? He has to uh, make the US happy in terms of investment there, and then he has to make other countries, including China, uh, feel special as well. But he can't give too much attention to China, otherwise people in the US, uh, might be raising their eyebrows. So he's, he's actually uh, walking that fine line uh, very well. He's he's really good at the dance. And yes, there is a risk that things can change next week or the next month because chips and technology have become an absolute bargaining chip, and China has rare earth metals that they are flexing their muscles with. Literally, our US manufacturing is dead in the water with automobiles and jet engines and electronics if we can't get access to China's rare earth minerals. I, I will say though, I think this is a good sign, right? We've had a quid pro quo, uh, we enabled access again to EDA from synopsis and cadence, uh, offering the H20 and um, I I think it's really the hawks in Washington that are having issues with this. Why they're having issues uh, with a detuned H20 is a little bit surprised to me. Letnik got on TV and talked about it being four generations behind. That's not exactly uh, accurate, but it's close, uh, it's close enough. Uh, so yeah, I think it's just a bargaining chip and there could be some risk down the line in a Trump administration uh, you know, until that final deal has been signed and even after that. I mean, Trump signed a deal with Mexico with USMCA and came back and then added additional tariffs on top of that, even after the deal that he had cut before.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:19:37.817815+00:00"}

ASML shares were down 8% in premarket trading ahead of the New York Stock Exchange open.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nAlthough ASML's cautious guidance about 2026 is weighing on investors post-earnings, the long-term growth story is still intact. The company is a vital piece in the supply of arguably one of the most important components of the global economy, and with AI spending and other digital efforts likely to continue to build for years to come, there should be solid demand for semiconductors and the machines needed to make them.\n\nThe geopolitical situation is rapidly changing. Just this week, the U.S. reversed a ban on Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) selling its H20 chips in China. In a recorded interview posted on ASML's website accompanying earnings, the company's chief financial officer, Roger Dassen, attributed the second-quarter beat in part to tariffs having a \"less negative\" impact than anticipated.\n\nIf that trend continues, ASML's caution about 2026 could prove to be overly conservative.\n\nHelpful Resources", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:19:41.645964+00:00"}

According to analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, total sales growth for TSMC over the next five years should average nearly 20% annually. And between the stock's 22.4-times earnings valuation and its 1.8% dividend yield, that means TSMC is almost perfectly priced for the long-term growth that almost everyone is certain will happen.\n\nGranted, short term hiccups could arise. In ASML's case, growth is probably slowing, at least in part because of sanctions placed on exports of chip-making machinery to China. But there are plenty of other countries in the world that need chips, and both ASML and TSMC can still sell to them.\n\nLong term, I expect TSMC stock is going to do just fine.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:19:43.180936+00:00"}

The firm has been caught in between the US and China — its biggest market last year — as their relationship deteriorates.\n\nWhile tensions between the two nations have eased in recent days, Fouquet’s comments reflect how mixed messages from Washington on trade and foreign relations are weighing on the semiconductor industry.\n\nASML forecast third-quarter net sales between €7.4 billion and €7.9 billion. That’s below the €8.2 billion average analyst estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It expects 15% revenue growth for the year.\n\nChief Financial Officer Roger Dassen said ASML’s clients are more worried about the global trade war now than they were in April.\n\n“Our customers are more concerned about the tariffs discussion today than they were three months ago,” Dassen said on a call with analysts Wednesday. “Countries are in full battle mode again when it comes to tariffs.”\n\nWashington’s chaotic trade policy rollout has roiled markets and made planning major spending difficult. While chips are currently exempt from the US reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on Aug. 1, President Donald Trump has said sector-specific levies on semiconductors could also be in the cards.\n\nDespite ASML’s downgraded outlook for next year, Fouquet said the company’s “AI customers’ fundamentals remain strong.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:20:02.803425+00:00"}

And meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury yield has surpassed 5% for the first time since late May. Tariffs remain a key part of this story, of course, as investors wait for more updates on President Trump's trade plans and assess how those new duties could potentially keep inflation higher. On Tuesday, Trump said levies on pharmaceutical companies will quote probably come at the end of July, while adding that tariffs on semiconductors will likely be implemented on a quote similar timeline. Despite that tariff back and forth, portion portions of the tech trade have continued to chug higher.

ASML sells its machines to customers globally, including American chip maker Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), the world’s largest contract chip maker.\n\nSemiconductors are currently exempted from U.S. tariffs, but it’s unclear whether gear makers like ASML would benefit from that. Trump also said late Tuesday that he was probably going to impose tariffs on semiconductors, along with pharmaceuticals, by Aug. 1, according to Bloomberg.\n\nASML also narrowed its growth outlook for the year. The company said it expects a full-year 2025 total net sales increase of around 15% relative to 2024 and projected gross margin of around 52%. Both of those numbers were around the midpoint of the outlook the company offered with its first quarter results.\n\nThe \"SOX\" index of semiconductor stocks was down 1% Wednesday afternoon.\n\nCorrection: ASML executives said they could not confirm growth in 2026.

It monopolizes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the cutting-edge process essential for fabricating next-gen semiconductors. No company can match ASML’s precision, which operates at a nanoscopic scale using 13.5nm light, space-grade ZEISS mirrors, and billionth-of-a-meter alignment. With zero real competitors, ASML stands as a gatekeeper to the global chip supply chain, enabling products from NVIDIA, Apple, AMD, Intel, and TSMC. Without ASML, advanced chips—and by extension AI, data centers, and national defense infrastructure—cannot be built.\n\nIts EUV tools sell for over $200 million each, but due to limited supply and overwhelming demand, ASML allocates rather than sells, maintaining a multi-year backlog. The firm’s moat is fortified by thousands of patents, irreplaceable suppliers, and two decades of lead time, making it effectively impossible to replicate even with unlimited capital. While capital intensive, ASML is extremely capital efficient, boasting near-50% gross margins, industry-leading returns, and consistent free cash flow that funds buybacks and dividends.\n\nEach new lithography node increases ASPs and deepens customer lock-in. As chips become more complex, demand for ASML’s precision rises—cementing it as a growing bottleneck in an increasingly consolidated industry. Its next leap, High NA EUV, is already underway. As the only Western firm producing such advanced lithography, ASML is also a geopolitical asset—banned in China, protected by allies. It doesn’t chase trends like AI or edge computing; it enables them. ASML is a fortress built on physics.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on ASML Holding N.V. by Monopolistic Investor in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s leadership in EUV lithography, disciplined pricing strategy, and strong government backing. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 8.06% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out. Monopolistic Investor shares an identical view but emphasizes ASML’s geopolitical and technological indispensability.\n\nASML Holding is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 80 hedge fund portfolios held ASML at the end of first quarter which was 86 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Today, however, the opportunities to find quality artificial intelligence (AI) stocks hanging on the discount rack may seem fewer and farther between.\n\nBut that's not to say that they don't exist.\n\nIn fact, today seems like a great time to pick up shares of Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), ASML (ASML 2.81%), and Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) while they're sitting in the bargain bin.\n\nDo this before you decide Nvidia isn't a bargain\n\nTrading today at around 52.5 times operating cash flow, Nvidia stock certainly doesn't seem like it's a value opportunity at first glance. Before making this determination, however, you'd be wise to remember that it's often useful to consider a stock's valuation in context of its historical valuation. In doing so, you'd find Nvidia stock's five-year average cash-flow multiple is 55.1, illustrating its less expensive valuation today.\n\nSimilarly, shares of Nvidia seem admittedly higher trading at 53 times trailing earnings, but since they have a five-year average P/E ratio of 70.2, shares seem attractively priced right now.\n\nA semiconductor stalwart, investors would be hard pressed to find a company that supports advancement of the AI industry as much as Nvidia thanks to the graphics processing units it designs for data centers, where AI computing occurs. Additionally, Nvidia has ownership stakes in a variety of AI companies that are driving innovation in a variety of fields including generative AI and healthcare.\n\nYou might not know the name, but its AI influence is huge\n\nUnsurprisingly, the production of sophisticated semiconductors that companies rely on to drive AI innovation is far from a simple process. That's where ASML comes in. The company provides hardware, software, and services that help facilitate the mass production of microchips found in AI applications. Most notably, the company provides semiconductor makers with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems -- systems that enable the printing of the smallest features on microchips at the highest density. This is an invaluable tool for advanced semiconductor makers such as ASML customers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the allure of ASML with respect to the vital role it plays in helping chipmakers; it's currently the only company worldwide to manufacture EUV lithography systems.\n\nLike with Nvidia, ASML stock's trailing P/E ratio of 33.7 might not shout \"bargain,\" but considering its five-year trailing earnings multiple of 40.8, the current valuation seems more compelling.\n\nDon't be fooled by Amazon's underperformance so far in 2025\n\nClimbing 2.6% since the start of 2025, Amazon stock has failed to keep pace with the S&P 500, which has risen 6.4% as of this writing. With the lack of uncertainty regarding tariffs and how they will impact the company's retail business, investors have chosen to keep their distance -- unlike 2024 when Amazon stock soared more than 44%.\n\nWhile the stock's lackluster rise in 2025 may be disheartening for current shareholders, it helps to provide a good entry point for prospective investors. Currently, shares are priced 36.7 times trailing earnings -- a hefty discount to their five-year average P/E of 64.1.\n\nFrom its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, which supports its customers develop their own AI resources, to the development of AI tools like the virtual assistant Alexa and Amazon Q, an AI assistant used in workplace settings, the company has broad exposure to the AI industry. Plus, there's the numerous ways that Amazon is leveraging AI in everything it owns, making it even clearer that this AI powerhouse has a great opportunity to flourish in the years ahead.\n\nBargain shoppers have several choices to quench their thirst for AI stocks\n\nWhile it's always important to focus on the present and look toward the future, taking a peak at the past can also prove to be pretty helpful -- especially with respect to valuing stocks. At first glance, Nvidia, ASML, and Amazon may all seem to sport rich price tags, but, when taking into account their historical valuations, it becomes much clearer how they are all available at a discount right now.\n\nAll three companies provide varying opportunities, but Nvidia is arguably the best choice right now for those seeking the most concentrated exposure to the burgeoning field of AI.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:20:59.161963+00:00"}

The Nasdaq Composite is up 7% on the year, and many of the biggest tech companies are at or near all-time highs, including market leader Nvidia, as well as Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\n\nThose are all quality companies, but they're far from the only good long-term investments in this market sector. Let's check out a few other tech stocks that should excel over the next decade.\n\n1. ASML\n\nSemiconductor companies are a crucial part of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. ASML (ASML 2.81%) supports the industry with the lithography equipment needed to manufacture semiconductors. This equipment uses light to transfer patterns onto a semiconductor's silicone wafer.\n\nThe company's most advanced products are its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems that are used for AI chips. ASML is also the only company to manufacture EUV lithography systems right now, and because of how complex these machines are, it's not a market a competitor could enter overnight.\n\nThe biggest threat to ASML in this regard is China, which is investing in its own domestic EUV lithography machines. It's a valid concern, but making a commercially viable machine that matches the quality ASML offers could take several years or longer.\n\nASML stock has fallen 25% over the past year as its earnings reports have been hit or miss. That's not unusual for its business model, though. The company sells extremely expensive products (EUV lithography machines start at $220 million) and doesn't move a high volume.\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29, ASML isn't overly expensive, and leadership is expecting 2025 and 2026 to be growth years based on conversations with its customers. The current dip gives new investors the chance to buy a wide-moat business at a fair price.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nSpeaking of semiconductor companies, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), or TSMC, is another business with a dominant market position. TSMC is the world's top semiconductor foundry, with a nearly 68% market share. Many leading tech companies, including Nvidia, Apple, and Advanced Micro Devices, rely on TSMC to make their chips.\n\nThere's no shortage of reasons to be bullish on TSMC. Revenue and net income have both grown considerably -- up 134% and 110% over the past five years, respectively. Management projections are for revenue to increase at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2029.\n\nTSMC's growth prospects also look promising because of its ambitious expansion plans. It's working on nine new production facilities this year in Taiwan, the U.S., Japan, and Germany.\n\nYou don't need to pay a premium for this semiconductor stock, either. It's trading at a forward P/E ratio of 24, less than the Nasdaq-100. Given that semiconductors are an essential component of all kinds of technology, as well as the excellent revenue projections for TSMC, I'd say the current price is a bargain.\n\n3. The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD 0.18%) is a different type of AI stock than the first two companies on this list. Its business is advertising, and specifically, it's a demand-side platform (DSP). A DSP is a software that connects advertisers with digital companies that have ad space. Advertisers upload their ads and set a budget, companies with ad space put in their bid requests, and The Trade Desk's software acts as the middleman between the two.\n\nIn 2023, The Trade Desk launched Kokai, a platform with AI tools to help advertisers with budget allocation, bid strategy, and audience targeting. According to the company's data analysis, campaigns on Kokai have delivered a 43% lower cost per unique household, 24% lower cost per click, and 27% lower cost per action on average.\n\nThe Trade Desk's share price plummeted after it missed revenue expectations for the fourth quarter of last year. It's currently down 36% on the year, but that's arguably an overreaction. This was the first time The Trade Desk missed guidance in eight years, and it returned to form in the first quarter of 2025. Revenue grew 25% to $616 million and net income grew 8% to $51 million.\n\nShares have never been cheap, and even after the recent downturn, The Trade Desk is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 41. But advertising is a rapidly growing industry, especially digital ads. Precedence Research forecasts that global digital ad spend will grow from $650 billion in 2025 to about $1.5 trillion in 2034.

The company, which is also ASML's top customer, is expected to order the tools it needs for its upcoming manufacturing process, N2, this year.\n\n\"We see a better-than-expected demand and order from TSMC and China players, but lower-than-expected demand and order from Intel and Samsung,\" said Kevin Wang, analyst at Mizuho.\n\nPositive news on talks with clients over future orders would also offer reassurance that it will meet current market forecasts, said Hesselink.\n\nASML still has a long way to go in 2025 to fulfill booking expectations for its lithography systems, after net bookings, the industry's most closely watched figure, came in at 3.9 billion euro ($4.6 billion) in the first quarter, missing estimates, analysts say.\n\nIts earnings will provide a gauge of the resilience of China's chipmakers, which have been buying lower-end ASML equipment not impacted by export restrictions. That demand helped the company beat first-quarter forecasts.\n\nLast October, ASML projected Chinese orders would fall to a 20% share of all machine sales in 2025.\n\nIn fact, they constituted 27% of machine sales, steady from a quarter earlier. Analysts expect that trend to continue unless U.S. export curbs are further extended to apply to the older equipment.\n\n($1 = 0.8552 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Nathan Vifflin in Amsterdam; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Bernadette Baum)", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:21:03.663694+00:00"}

This segment contributed about 64% of total revenues, reinforcing its role as a key growth driver for the company.\n\n\n\nThe growth is fueled by Lam Research’s advanced products that address the needs of next-generation memory and logic technologies. Within deposition, Lam Research’s Striker SPARC atomic layer deposition (ALD) is delivering the industry’s densest conformal low-k carbide films and has secured multiple wins for spacer applications and with a leading-edge foundry.\n\n\n\nThe ALTUS Halo system supports barrierless atomic layer deposition of molybdenum, which reduces resistance in interconnect layers by 50% versus legacy technologies. This is critical for achieving the high I/O performance needed in 3D NAND for AI workloads. During the last reported quarter, Lam Research stated that Halo’s molybdenum process is seeing increased adoption across its leading 3D NAND customers, contributing to strong systems demand. This growing traction underscores Halo’s role in driving the company’s overall systems revenue growth.\n\n\n\nWithin the edge, its Akara system has been gaining traction, with multiple wins in critical etch at a major Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) customer. Its ultrafast plasma control enables improved etch selectivity and precision, which supports Lam Research’s long-term DRAM roadmaps, positioning LRCX for future device architectures like 3D DRAM and CFET.\n\n\n\nLam Research projected fourth-quarter revenues to be approximately $5.0 billion (±$300 million). However, management remains cautious about macroeconomic factors that could influence customer spending trends. With strong adoption of Striker, Halo, and Akara, and rising demand for advanced NAND and DRAM nodes, Lam Research’s systems business appears well-positioned to support long-term growth.\n\nHow Competitors Fare Against Lam Research\n\nSemiconductor heavyweights like Applied Materials AMAT and ASML Holding ASML are also seeing strong momentum as memory makers invest in next-generation technologies.\n\n\n\nDuring second-quarter fiscal 2025 results, Applied Materials projected that revenues from its advanced DRAM customers would grow more than 40% in fiscal 2025. Applied Materials expects this demand to be driven by increased investments in DDR5 and high-bandwidth memory.\n\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, ASML Holding stated that 42% of its net system sales came from memory. Moreover, ASML Holding highlighted strong customer demand for its products. The demand was driven by ASML’s DRAM and logic customers, which are ramping leading-edge nodes using ASML’s NXE:3800E EUV systems.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:21:05.864711+00:00"}

This positive momentum has been a boon for companies like ASML, particularly in the wafer fabrication equipment space.\n\nASML Holding has been at the forefront of technological innovation, benefiting significantly from the industry’s shift toward smaller, more advanced technology nodes. These nodes are essential for building cutting-edge digital infrastructures that support AI, 5G and high-performance computing. The increasing complexity of chip designs has made ASML's state-of-the-art lithography tools indispensable to chipmakers.\n\nIn both logic and memory markets, the demand for ASML’s lithography tools continues to climb. The ongoing transition to next-generation memory technologies, such as DDR5 and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), is a tailwind for the company. With DRAM manufacturers ramping up technology upgrades, ASML Holding is likely to have witnessed strong momentum in the second quarter, driven by heightened memory demand.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:21:07.981741+00:00"}

This time, the reverb barely disrupted the market's rhythm.\n\nLast week, as Trump again rolled out tariff announcements that left some of America's trading partners surprised , investors largely took the news in stride. The worst, it seemed, was past us.\n\nSecond quarter earnings, then, appear set to reflect the trough of corporate America's mini-cycle of panic, acceptance, then relief around Trump's tariff goals, the whole of which took about five weeks in April and May .\n\nIn the third quarter, analysts are expecting earnings will grow 7.3% over last year. Full-year profit growth is expected to clock in at 9%, according to FactSet data . In 2026, earnings should grow 13.9%, according to analyst forecasts.\n\nThe second quarter includes the peak of tariff-related uncertainty — Trump's shocking \"Liberation Day\" announcement took place on the second day of the quarter. But the market's recent rally suggests the backward-looking set of results companies will roll out in the weeks ahead has already been discounted.\n\nData from FactSet published July 3 showed analysts are coming into second quarter earnings season expecting 5% earnings growth for the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ). Should this forecast come through, it will mark the slowest pace of profit growth since the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nResults from Netflix ( NFLX ) will kick off earnings from big US tech firms, with ASML ( ASML ) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( TSM ) set to offer key updates on the AI-related chip boom. PepsiCo ( PEP ), United ( UAL ), and American Express ( AXP ) are among the other notable firms set to release their quarterly results.\n\nOn the earnings side, all the major US banks will report results this week, with renewed investor enthusiasm about the IPO and M&A markets , along with Wells Fargo's ( WFC ) freedom from a decade of more stringent regulatory restrictions, likely to feature.\n\nInflation data out Tuesday morning will set the economic agenda for the week. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be a key data point for investors and policymakers to weigh, with the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision looming less than two weeks away.\n\nStocks are slipping after trading near record highs as a flurry of trade announcements, deals, and extensions kept investors on their toes last week. In the week ahead, a busier economic and earnings calendar will offer them more to chew on.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\n\nAs the president himself told NBC News last week, \"I think the tariffs have been very well received. The stock market hit a new high [on Thursday].\"\n\nAnd the S&P 500 fell just 0.33% from its record on Friday.\n\nBut it was poised to add to that loss on Monday morning, as investors eyed Trump's threat to impose a 30% tariff rate on US imports from the EU and Mexico. The key US trading partners will see the rates kick in Aug. 1 if no deal is made before then, the president said in a Saturday post to social media.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the press before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on July 11, 2025. (Photo by MEHMET ESER/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images) · MEHMET ESER via Getty Images\n\nInflation off target\n\nWith investors — and the president — waiting with bated breath for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates, Tuesday's inflation data isn't likely to accelerate the central bank's urgency.\n\nWall Street economists expect to see inflation move further from the Fed's goals, with \"core\" consumer prices, which exclude food and gas and are more closely watched by the Fed, set to rise 2.9% over the prior year in June. On a monthly basis, both \"core\" and headline inflation is set to rise 0.3%.\n\nRead more: How jobs, inflation, and the Fed are all related\n\n\"Inflation data in line with our forecasts will keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines as it assesses the impact of tariffs on inflation, which is only starting to come into view,\" wrote economists at Oxford Economics in a client note on Friday. The firm also noted that the disinflationary benefit of lower oil prices that followed the onset of tariffs in the spring is rolling off the books.\n\nAll of which, in Oxford's view, likely keeps the Fed on the sidelines at least through the summer.\n\nData from the CME Group as of Friday showed traders were pricing in just a 4.7% chance the Fed cuts rates later this month. A month ago, those odds were closer to 20%.\n\nTrump, however, has remained consistent in his calls for lower rates, telling reporters this week he thinks Fed Chair Jerome Powell should resign immediately.\n\nThe challenge, for both Trump and the Fed, is that tariff policy only complicates the rate picture.\n\n\"The tariffs announced this week would raise the effective rate by around 2 [percentage points],\" wrote Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave in a client note Friday.\n\n\"Based on the composition of imports over the last 12 months, the effective rate would rise to nearly 14%. In other words, there are upside risks to our base case that the effective tariffs will settle at around 10%.\"\n\nAnd although Bhave notes there appears room for tariff rates to be negotiated down, this policy uncertainty makes it harder for the Fed to cut interest rates.\n\n\"Chair Powell has repeatedly argued that the Fed wants greater clarity on the impact of policy changes before making its next move,\" Bhave added. \"Such clarity might not be forthcoming if there are risks of additional meaningful changes to the tariff regime.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) · Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nStocks, retargeted\n\nThis year's stock market volatility has created an ample — if not quite equal — amount of volatility in Wall Street forecasts on where the market will finish the year.\n\nLast week offered the latest case in point.\n\nStrategists at both Goldman Sachs and Bank of America raised their price targets on the S&P 500 in notes this week, with Goldman raising its year-end target to 6,600 and BofA putting a 6,300 forecast on where the benchmark index will close this year. The firms had been looking for the index to settle at 6,100 and 5,600, respectively, ahead of these revisions.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed on Friday at 6,259.\n\nIn a note to clients published Tuesday, Bank of America's head of US equity strategy, Savita Subramanian, cited \"Corporate America Exceptionalism\" as a driving force in revising the outlook for stocks higher.\n\nIn essence, the S&P 500 is now constituted by businesses with stronger earnings profiles that are better able to weather the uncertainty of tariffs and which are, ultimately, less sensitive to the economic cycle. All of which bolsters the case for earnings growth to remain strong.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Communication Services (XLC) and Technology (XLK) sectors are expected to grow earnings by 29.5% and 16.6%, respectively.\n\nThese sectors house five of the \"Magnificent Seven\" names — Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) are in the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) sector — and are at the center of the AI trade. Only Utilities (XLU), another sector that's been a surprise AI beneficiary with power demand surging as data centers are built out, is expected to grow earnings at a rate equal to or better than the overall index; both Utilities and the S&P 500 as a whole are forecast to grow earnings 5% in the second quarter.\n\nAnd over the long term, the most important driver of stock prices is earnings growth.\n\nGoldman Sachs' chief US equity strategist David Kostin made a similar point, writing that the firm expects \"the digestion of tariffs to be a gradual process, and large-cap companies appear to have some buffer from inventories ahead of the increase in tariff rates.\"\n\nThe firm added that S&P 500 companies appeared to enter the second quarter with a good inventory buffer, and that earnings call commentary \"shows S&P 500 firms plan to use a combination of cost savings, supplier adjustments, and pricing to offset the impact of tariffs.\"\n\nAn outgrowth, no doubt, of corporates being more prepared for Trump's tariff-motivated fiscal policy the second time around.\n\nBut it is the composition of the S&P 500 itself — an index now dominated by a handful of tech-adjacent giants — that ultimately buffers investors from much of the tariff turmoil.\n\nEconomic data and earnings calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEarnings: No major earnings reports are set for release.\n\nEconomic data: No major economic data set for release.\n\nTuesday\n\nEarnings: JPMorgan (JPM), Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), State Street (STT), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Albertsons (ACI), JB Hunt (JBHT)\n\nEconomic data: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.1% previously); Consumer Price Index, year-over-year, June (+2.6% expected, +2.4% previously); \"core\" Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.1% previously); \"core\" Consumer Price Index, year-over-year, June (+2.9% expected; +2.8% previously); NY Fed Empire State Manufacturing index, July (-9 expected, -16 previously)\n\nWednesday\n\nEarnings: Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), PNC Financial (PNC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), United Airlines (UAL), ASML (ASML), Progressive (PGR), Alcoa (AA), Kinder Morgan (KMI)\n\nEconomic data: Producer price index, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.1% previously); Producer price index, year-over-year, June (+2.5% expected, +2.6% previously); \"Core\" producer price index, month-over-month, June (+0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); \"Core\" producer price index, year-over-year, June (+2.7% expected; +3% previously); Industrial production, June (+0.1% expected, -0.2% previously); Federal Reserve Beige Book\n\nThursday\n\nEarnings: Netflix (NFLX), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), PepsiCo (PEP), US Bancorp (USB), Abbott (ABT), Cintas (CTAS), Interactive Brokers (IBKR)\n\nEconomic data: Retail sales, June, month-over-month (+0.1% expected, -0.9% previously); Retail sales, ex-auto and gas, June (+0.3% expected, -0.1% previously); Import price index, June (+0.2% expected, +0% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ended July 12 (235,000 expected, 227,000 previously); Philly Fed Manufacturing Index, July (-0.5 expected, -4 previously); Homebuilder sentiment, July (33 expected, 32 previously)\n\nFriday\n\nEarnings: 3M (MMM), American Express (AXP), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Ally (ALLY), Truist (TFC), Regions Financial (RF), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN)\n\nEconomic data: Housing starts, June (+3.5% expected, -9.8% previously); Building permits, June (-0.3% expected, -2% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, July, preliminary reading (61.5 expected, 60.7 previously)\n\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:21:12.060696+00:00"}

Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) and ASML (ASML 2.81%) are two of the exceptions, trading at cheap prices compared to their long-term growth prospects. Alphabet is a leading cloud provider and consumer AI company, while ASML is a monopoly seller of semiconductor equipment machines, all sectors with strong tailwinds that will drive demand higher in the years to come.\n\nHere's why investors should buy both Alphabet and ASML stock based on valuation and their explosive growth prospects.\n\nAlphabet's long-term advantages\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo. It has built a plethora of consumer internet services with billions of users along with the cloud-computing infrastructure that is best in class. Decades of investment have prepared the company for the age of AI, with its huge swathes of data feeding the training for these new technologies. This is why Alphabet is at or near the lead with its Gemini AI tools across all relevant categories. The platform now has hundreds of millions of users and is ramping monetization quickly.\n\nAI will help the traditional Google Search and YouTube businesses as well. This could include things such as video-suggestion optimization on YouTube to AI overviews on Google Search. Investors are worried about AI disrupting Google's business model, but it is already disrupting itself and adding new methods to monetize its user base with more and more relevant features.\n\nGoogle Search revenue can keep up steady growth. The segment grew 10% year over year last quarter to $50.7 billion in revenue. More importantly for future growth may be subscriptions and platform revenue, which is where Gemini revenue is segmented. It grew revenue 19% year over year to $10.4 billion and could see accelerating growth due to the rapid adoption of Gemini tools.\n\nSecond, let's not forget Google Cloud, which sells computing power from Alphabet's immense AI-focused data centers to third parties. Google Cloud revenue grew 28% year over year last quarter to $12.3 billion and is seeing rapidly expanding profit margins. This segment will be a huge earnings driver for Alphabet in the years to come.\n\nAll these strong, growing revenue lines you can get for a measly price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.5 right now. Alphabet's strong earnings potential and this low P/E make it a fantastic buy for any investor's portfolio today.\n\nGOOG PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nA monopoly provider of equipment products\n\nGoogle and YouTube are sometimes thought of as monopoly services, which make them great businesses. But they do have at least some competition out there. ASML, with its ultra-advanced lithography machines, has zero competition, giving it a pure monopoly of selling to semiconductor manufacturers.\n\nASML's lithography machines allow manufacturers to print microscopic transistor layers for computer chips. Without its machines, the world would not have the advanced computer chips from Nvidia that are powering the AI revolution, making it one of the most important companies in the world. This allows ASML to sell its machines for a steep price.\n\nIn the past 10 years, ASML's revenue has grown by a cumulative 350% on the back of lithography machine sales to semiconductor manufacturers. Good news for the company: Investment in this sector is poised to keep growing because of demand for AI.\n\nFor example, you have Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing spending over $100 billion just to build manufacturing plants in the United States. A lot of that spending will go to buying machines from ASML. Repeat this in multiple markets around the world, and ASML has a huge growth engine that can keep revenue marching higher for the next 10 years.\n\nASML currently trades at a P/E of 33.5, which might seem high compared to Alphabet. However, as a true monopoly, ASML deserves to trade at a steep earnings multiple, and I think it will continue to throughout the decade.

Burberry points out, for example, that UK business continues to be seriously impacted by the withdrawal of VAT refunds for overseas visitors, which has led to the UK being the least competitive destination in Europe for tourist shopping.\n\n\"In addition, the group’s important Asian market is also a concern.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned +2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, which ASML falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nASML is expected to post earnings of $5.94 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +37.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $27.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +32%. This estimate has changed +1.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $30.25 indicates a change of +10.1% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ASML is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:21:19.925869+00:00"}

This increase came mainly from strong demand for Deep Ultraviolet (“DUV”) lithography systems, which Chinese chipmakers use to manufacture mature-node chips, such as those based on the 28nm process. These chips are widely used in products like smartphones, appliances and automotive parts.\n\nHowever, ASML Holding’s newer EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) systems are still restricted from shipping to China due to U.S. and Dutch export controls. These restrictions aim to prevent China from producing cutting-edge chips used in advanced computing and military applications. The situation creates an ongoing risk for ASML’s China business, especially as trade tensions continue to rise.\n\nSo far, ASML Holding has not seen any impact on customer behavior or order cancellations. On the first-quarter earnings call, management confirmed that business discussions remain unchanged. However, they also admitted that the trade environment is increasingly uncertain. ASML is working with both customers and suppliers to limit the effects of potential new rules, but it’s difficult to predict how things will evolve.\n\nWhile China’s demand for DUV systems remains strong for now, any tightening of trade rules could hurt ASML Holding’s future revenues.

Like ASML, Lam Research is exposed to U.S. export policies, but it can ship tools for legacy nodes that China continues to ramp up.\n\nBoth companies, AMAT and LRCX, have longstanding customer relationships in China and could see higher tool sales if ASML’s DUV shipments slow.

One reason tech stocks are rising once again is because of strong results from the major names in this sector.\n\nIn fact, the tech stock rally is the reason why the Nasdaq Composite has outpaced the 24% jump in the S&P 500 index during the same period. Tech stocks tend to outperform the broader market because of their ability to capitalize on disruptive trends. So buying solid technology companies could help investors get rich in the long run.\n\nIf you have $1,000 in investible cash right now, it would be a good idea to put that money into the two names discussed below, either individually or combined, as they can turn out to be top growth stocks in the future.\n\n1. Twilio\n\nCloud communications provider Twilio (TWLO 3.02%) has been a solid investment in the past year, turning $1,000 into more than $2,100 as of this writing. The stock has gained such impressive momentum thanks to an acceleration in growth that's fueled by the adoption of its artificial intelligence (AI)-focused communications tools.\n\nTwilio provides application programming interfaces (APIs) that help its clients reach their customers through various channels such as messaging, email, voice, video, and others. Its APIs help deliver alerts and notifications, set up interactive voice response systems, and create marketing campaigns as well. Twilio is now enhancing its solutions with AI.\n\nTwilio's clients can now use its AI tools to provide their customers with personalized recommendations, create virtual AI agents to automate tasks, and also build voice AI agents, among other things. Importantly, Twilio's AI tools are gaining traction. Management pointed out on the company's May earnings conference call that \"customers that engaged with our AI assistant were 3x more likely to upgrade from a free trial to a paid account.\"\n\nWhat's more, Twilio is not only landing new customers but is also winning more business from existing customers. Twilio's dollar-based net expansion rate of 107% in the first quarter increased by 5 points as compared to the year-ago period. This metric is calculated by dividing Twilio's revenue from active customer accounts at the end of a quarter by the revenue from that same customer cohort in the year-ago period.\n\nSo, a dollar-based net expansion rate of more than 100% is proof that existing customers are adopting more of its offerings, or they are using Twilio's existing solutions more. Twilio also added 22,000 active customer accounts in the first quarter of the year, so the company is now sitting on a huge customer base that could open a solid cross-selling opportunity that should boost both its top- and bottom-line growth.\n\nTwilio's earnings shot up by 42% year over year in the first quarter, and it raised its full-year guidance for non-GAAP income from operations by $25 million to a range of $850 million to $875 million. As such, it is easy to see why analysts have been upgrading their earnings growth expectations.\n\nThe chart above suggests that Twilio's growth is on track to accelerate in the future. That makes the stock a solid buy right now since it is trading at 27 times forward earnings, which is a discount to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index's average forward earnings multiple of 29. Putting $1,000 into Twilio could turn out to be a smart long-term move as the company seems capable of flying higher even after clocking impressive gains in the past month.\n\n2. ASML Holding\n\nSemiconductor giant ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) has jumped an impressive 31% in the past three months on account of the broader market rally. Even then, shares of the company are now trading at an attractive 28 times forward earnings. Buying ASML at this valuation may turn out to be profitable in the long run since the company is on track to capitalize on the secular growth of the semiconductor market.\n\nASML's lithography machines help chipmakers and foundries to print patterns on silicon wafers, thereby creating the foundation for manufacturing chips. McKinsey points out that semiconductor manufacturers across the globe plan to invest $1 trillion in new chip fabrication plants, which should create the need for more of ASML's machines.\n\nNot surprisingly, market research firm TechNavio sees an incremental revenue opportunity worth $34 billion in the lithography systems market through 2028. ASML is the only company that produces extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which are used for manufacturing advanced chips that go into various AI applications. It also has a 90% share in deep ultraviolet lithography systems, which are used for producing chips based on more mature nodes deployed in applications such as manufacturing.\n\nASML's moat is the reason analysts have become bullish about the company's earnings growth prospects going forward.\n\nAlso, the company indicated on its April earnings conference call that its results could be at the higher end of its expectations on the back of healthy AI-driven semiconductor demand and the new capacity that its customers are expected to bring online. That looks likely considering the massive investments in semiconductor manufacturing capacity as discussed earlier, along with the fact that ASML supplies its equipment to leading foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, and Samsung.\n\nAll this indicates that ASML is indeed capable of delivering the bottom-line improvement that analysts are expecting from it. So there is a good chance that it could be rewarded with a premium valuation thanks to its improved earnings power, and that could translate into healthy stock market gains.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:21:27.714904+00:00"}

And for ones that make AI models, the requirements are tougher.\n\nBut companies are also unsure how to comply with the rules as there are no guidelines yet. The AI Code of Practice, a guidance document to help AI developers to comply with the act, missed its publication date of May 2.\n\n\"To address the uncertainty this situation is creating, we urge the Commission to propose a two-year 'clock-stop' on the AI Act before key obligations enter into force,\" said an open letter published on Thursday by a group of 45 European companies.\n\nIt also called for simplification of the new rules.\n\nA Commission spokesperson said the European AI Board is discussing the timing to implement the Code of Practice, with the end of 2025 being considered.\n\nAnother concern is that the act may stifle innovation, particularly in Europe where companies have smaller compliance teams than their U.S. counterparts.\n\nWILL IT BE POSTPONED?\n\nWhile the Commission is set for GPAI rules to come in force from next month, its plan to publish key guidance to help thousands of companies to comply with the AI rules by year end would mark a six-month delay from its May deadline.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:21:47.135865+00:00"}

EPIC, short for Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization, will be the largest and most advanced research & development (R&D) facility of its kind. The research facility will also be the centerpiece of Applied Materials’ high-velocity co-innovation model.\n\n\n\nThe EPIC Center is designed to shorten learning cycles and accelerate customer time-to-market. What sets EPIC Center apart is deep customer integration. Applied Materials plans to co-locate teams from top chipmaking companies directly inside the facility to jointly develop solutions for technologies like gate-all-around transistors, backside power delivery, and advanced packaging.\n\n\n\nThe EPIC Center lab will mark an extension to Applied Materials’ EPIC Platform, which is a collaborative ecosystem designed to accelerate innovation and commercialization in the semiconductor industry. EPIC Center is not a standalone effort toward enhancing R&D capabilities.\n\n\n\nEarlier in June, the company extended its collaboration with CEA-Leti to accelerate innovation in specialty semiconductors. The joint lab with CEA-Leti in France will focus on chips serving the Internet of Things, Communications, Automotive, Power and Sensors market and energy-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. The extended longstanding collaboration is expected to further complement Applied Materials’ EPIC Platform’s leading-edge roadmap.\n\n\n\nWith the opening of EPIC Center, Applied Materials will be able to work with customers on several technology nodes ahead of production.

ASML is making strong progress with its High-NA EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography systems, which could shape the future of advanced chipmaking. In the first quarter of 2025, the company shipped its fifth and final NXE:5000 High-NA system. It began delivering the newer NXE:5200 model in the second quarter.\n\nThese systems are designed to help chipmakers print smaller and more complex features with fewer steps and better yields. Early feedback from major customers like Intel Corporation INTC and Samsung has been positive.\n\nOn its first-quarter earnings call, ASML Holding revealed that Intel has reported exposing over 30,000 wafers in a single quarter using the High-NA tool. This also resulted in a significant improvement in the process, with the number of process steps reducing to less than 10 from 40 on a given layer. Another user, Samsung, noted a 60% reduction in cycle time on one of its layers. These results demonstrate that the technology is maturing faster than ASML Holding’s earlier Low-NA EUV tools, which took longer to reach production readiness.\n\nDespite this promising start, mass demand for High-NA is still some time away. On its first-quarter earnings call, ASML Holding stated that the technology is in phase one, where customers use the tools for research and development. Phase two will begin around 2026-2027, with limited production use. Full adoption in volume manufacturing is expected in phase three.\n\nThe challenge now is to enhance the tool’s productivity and demonstrate its reliability in real-world applications. If that happens, High-NA could become a game-changer for leading-edge chipmakers. For now, ASML Holding looks well-positioned to lead this next phase of semiconductor innovation.\n\nCan ASML Stay Ahead as Rivals Push Chipmaking Tech Forward?\n\nApplied Materials, Inc.

With demand for AI computing on the rise, and a software advantage that keeps competitors at bay, several more years of rapid growth isn't a wild expectation.\n\nOn the surface, Nvidia stock looks expensive at 36 times earnings expectations. But once you consider how fast earnings are growing, the stock actually looks like a bargain right now.\n\nThe forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio divides the trailing price-to-earnings ratio by the rate of earnings growth Wall Street expects in the year ahead. Anything below a 1.0 is considered undervalued, so Nvidia's recent forward PEG of 0.79 suggests now is a good time to buy.\n\n2. Lam Research\n\nAMD and Intel are furiously trying to overcome Nvidia's software advantage. But even if they succeed, they'll still likely employ advanced etch and deposition equipment from Lam Research, a leader in the space.\n\nNow that advanced semiconductors are spacing nodes just a few nanometers apart, stacking semiconductor components is the way forward. As a leader in the verticalization processes, Lam Research could remain a vital equipment provider in the decade ahead. Its equipment is used to manufacture high bandwidth memory (HBM), which is an increasingly important component of AI processing.\n\nStrong demand from Nvidia helped Lam Research report first-quarter earnings that rose 12% year over year. Even if Nvidia unexpectedly loses its software advantage in the years ahead, the next leader in the semiconductor space will likely employ Lam's etch and deposition equipment to produce HBM, too.\n\nShares of Lam Research have been trading for just 24 times earnings estimates. This valuation is extremely low for a highly profitable company that could continue raising earnings at double-digit percentages for many years to come.\n\n3. ASML Holding\n\nWith $1,000, you could buy many shares of Nvidia or Lam Research. Advanced lithography system producer, ASML Holding is more than 25% off its previous peak, but you'll need at least $815 to buy one share at recent prices. (Don't get hung up on price, though. Price and value aren't the same thing, and fractional shares are available.)\n\nLike Lam Research, ASML is a niche producer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Its enormous lithography machines contain hundreds of thousands of components and require months to ship and assemble. When it comes to advanced chips that AI applications rely on, an ASML lithography machine is the only option.\n\nASML's already entrenched business requires heaps of capital, engineering knowledge, and relationships with semiconductor manufacturers. These sustainable advantages allowed earnings per share to rise by 16% annually over the past five years, and the gains could continue. At the midpoint of management's guided range, top-line sales are expected to climb by 14.8% this year. Without any competitors capable of marketing similar equipment, continued growth at a double-digit annual percentage seems likely.\n\nA stock market aware of ASML's competitive position rarely allows its stock price to fall into deep value territory. At recent prices, it's been trading for about 30 times forward-looking earnings expectations. This is a steep valuation, but it isn't one that ASML can't grow into. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio to hold over the long run looks like a smart move for most growth-oriented investors right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:22:04.968653+00:00"}

In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $8.46 billion, indicating a 25.87% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $27.33 per share and a revenue of $37.13 billion, signifying shifts of +31.27% and +21.54%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for ASML. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the business health and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned +7.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, which ASML falls in, has gained 11.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ASML is expected to post earnings of $5.87 per share, indicating a change of +35.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.33 points to a change of +31.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.04 indicates a change of +13.6% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ASML.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:22:14.970915+00:00"}

Analysts have projected that the AI market will be worth trillions of dollars in the next five to 10 years. If you have $3,000, that's more than enough to invest in a few of the companies set to capitalize on the AI boom.\n\nFor the best results, you may want to split your money among companies that each focus on different parts of the AI market. Here are three options to consider.\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom (AVGO 2.94%) is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. It creates AI chips that tech companies use in their data centers, similar (but not entirely identical) to GPU maker Nvidia.\n\nSemiconductor stocks are an excellent AI investment opportunity. They provide the hardware necessary to run the most advanced AI models, and the semiconductor industry is growing to meet rising demand. The global semiconductor market grew by 19.7% in 2024, and is projected to grow another 11.2% in 2025.\n\nBroadcom stands out from the competition because it makes customizable chips called AI accelerators. Some of the major hyperscalers, including Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.16%) and Meta Platforms, use Broadcom to make their own custom AI chips. It's rumored that OpenAI is another company partnering with Broadcom for this reason. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan says that it has three hyperscaler customers expected to deploy 1 million AI accelerators in 2027.\n\nBroadcom is on the pricey side, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38. That's common for AI companies, and based on Broadcom's momentum and earnings projections, this could still be a good time to invest.\n\nIt beat expectations in its second fiscal quarter of 2025, with revenue rising 20% year over year to $15 billion. AI revenue was particularly impressive, growing 46% year over year to $4.4 billion. Tan expects that to grow even more in the third quarter to $5.1 billion.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nTech conglomerate Alphabet is integrating AI throughout its products and services. Perhaps the most well-known example is the AI overviews that now sit at the top of Google search results. Alphabet has also added AI tools to Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, etc.), launched its Gemini chatbot, and uses AI for its self-driving car project, Waymo.\n\nAlphabet is both innovative and relatively safe, with a strong balance sheet, and shares are cheap right now. It has the lowest forward P/E ratio of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a nickname for seven of the largest tech companies.\n\nTo be fair, there are reasons why Alphabet is so affordable. It lost an antitrust lawsuit last year, with a judge ruling that it monopolized the open-web digital advertising market. A penalty hasn't been decided yet.\n\nAlphabet is also trimming its workforce, as reports came out earlier this month that it was offering buyouts to employees in its search, advertising, research, and engineering units. And there are fears that the growth of AI will negatively impact Alphabet's Google Search business.\n\nEven with those headwinds, Alphabet should continue to perform well as a long-term investment. Search may be its calling card, but it has built and acquired several successful businesses over the years, including Android, YouTube, and Google Cloud. And it has shown the ability to adjust and evolve its business, with the addition of AI to search results being one good example.\n\n3. ASML\n\nAs mentioned earlier, semiconductors are an essential part of AI (as well as most modern electronics). ASML (ASML 2.81%) is crucial to the semiconductor industry, as it manufactures extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines used to mass-produce high-performance microchips.\n\nIt sells these machines to companies that manufacture semiconductors, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, and Samsung. And these are massive, expensive pieces of equipment. High NA machines, its most advanced chipmaking technology, cost over $400 million and weigh more than six tons.\n\nASML's revenue can be up and down due to the nature of its business. It doesn't sell many machines -- it sold 77 lithography machines in the first quarter of 2025 (73 new and four used), but that was enough for 7.7 billion euros in revenue with a gross margin of 54%. Trade restrictions to China are also a risk factor.\n\nBut ASML has a wide moat, with an over 90% share of the lithography market. If the AI and semiconductor markets continue their rapid growth, ASML should benefit from that and could outperform the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:22:16.396872+00:00"}

In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s memory segment revenues jumped nearly 24% year over year to $1.31 billion.\n\nIn its NVM division, LRCX is experiencing strong demand driven by technology conversions as its customers transition from low-layer to 256-layer class NAND devices. NAND revenues are further driven by growth in chip demand to support the massive input-output speeds required for AI workloads. The NVM division’s sales grew approximately 21% year over year in the third quarter.\n\nThe growth in LRCX’s DRAM division was led by a demand shift to high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and rising DDR5 adoption among customers, which is boosting demand for its etching and deposition tools. Furthermore, LRCX reported that its DRAM customers are upgrading and repurposing existing tools for new applications, boosting its Customer Support Business Group (CSBG) division, which supports such endeavours. LRCX’s DRAM division revenues grew 26.7% year over year in the third quarter.\n\nLam Research is futureproofing its business with new innovations. Its recently introduced atomic layer deposition (ALD) innovations, like the ALTUS Halo systems and Striker SPARC ALD, are experiencing traction among customers and so is the Akara etch system, which won multiple applications with an important customer just after its launch. The company is now heavily investing in technology upgrades of DDR5, LPDDR5, and HBM technology processes.\n\nDespite having intermittent trade restrictions with China from the U.S. government, the company was able to keep its revenue growth consistent, as major customers for its DRAM and NAND technologies belong to Korea and Taiwan.

Applied Materials offers processes for both memory and foundry/logic markets like LRCX and has a strong installed base and service business, rivaling Lam Research's CSBG.\n\nIn the broader market, Lam Research competes with ASML Holdings ASML, which is a lithography tools provider, with specialisation in extreme ultraviolet lithography. Since Lam Research is moving toward EUV lithography and dry photoresist space from its primary etch and deposition expertise, LRCX is facing stiff competition from ASML Holdings.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:22:18.393289+00:00"}

As a result, I won't be surprised if these three companies are larger than it within the next three years.\n\nThe three stocks are Advance Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%), Salesforce (CRM -0.53%), and ASML (ASML 2.81%). All of these companies have strong growth cases but are also much larger than Palantir from a revenue and profit viewpoint.

Palantir started as a government-serving entity but expanded beyond that client base to the commercial side. That transition went extremely well, with both client bases making up a significant chunk of Palantir's revenue.\n\nPalantir has become one of the more hyped-up AI stocks, and it rose to a sky-high valuation that normally isn't seen with companies with the level of growth that it has.\n\nPalantir's market cap of $330 billion is much larger than AMD's ($206 billion), Salesforce's ($248 billion), or ASML's ($300 billion). However, all three of these companies produce much higher revenue and profits than Palantir.\n\nFrom a revenue standpoint, Palantir is about 1/10 of the size of this trio, and depending on which company it's compared to, anywhere from a fourth of the profits up to about 1/20 of the profits. So, why is Palantir valued as highly as this trio? After all, AMD, ASML, and Salesforce are all key competitors and beneficiaries of the AI arms race.\n\nIt all comes down to how much the market believes these stocks will grow over the next few years.\n\nPalantir's growth is about the same as ASML's and AMD's\n\nPalantir put up impressive growth over the past few quarters, including 39% growth in Q1 and projected growth of 38% in Q2. While Palantir has been delivering impressive growth for a bit longer than some other companies, it's not the fastest-growing business on this list.\n\nHowever, it's unlikely that ASML or AMD can keep up these elevated growth rates for the long term, which is why Palantir has a premium attached to the stock.\n\nFrom a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio standpoint, Palantir is valued at a massive premium to these other companies.\n\nPalantir deserves somewhat of a premium based on its strong growth and large runway, but 112 times sales is absurd. Few companies have ever achieved that valuation, and if a company has it, it most likely doubles its revenue quarter after quarter. Palantir isn't even close to that.\n\nAt most, I'd assign Palantir a 40 times sales premium, as any time a software company's growth rate is less than its P/S ratio (besides fully mature companies that have achieved maximum profitability), it's very expensive. Palantir is way over this threshold, which is why I think there's pain to come in the future.\n\nWhile AMD, ASML, and Salesforce are great investments in their own right, they will be larger stocks than Palantir in three years because I expect Palantir's stock to return to Earth. When that occurs, those three will rightfully be larger than Palantir based solely on how much money they generate as a business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:22:21.818373+00:00"}

ASML should capitalize on growth in AI as it's the only maker of EUV lithography equipment.  AMD is building momentum in the data center and beyond.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/21/no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-buy/", "published_at": "2025-06-21T08:52:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "After falling into a bear market just a couple of months ago, the Nasdaq Composite is back to flirting with all-time highs as concerns over a trade war have been tamped down and fears about a recession have faded against solid earnings reports and macroeconomic data.\n\nThe recovery in the Nasdaq has been led by artificial intelligence (AI) stocks like Nvidia that are also hovering near all-time highs again, but not every tech stock is in that position. Let's take a look at two AI stocks that are trading at a discount to previous levels right now that are worth buying on the dip.\n\n1. ASML\n\nASML (ASML 2.81%) has one of the biggest competitive advantages in the whole tech industry. The company is the only maker of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment in the world. Chip manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung, and Intel rely on ASML's equipment to make the most advanced chips on the market.\n\nGiven there is a boom in AI right now, you might think that would make the stock a big winner, but ASML stock is actually down over the last year (off 26%) as the semiconductor equipment industry has been in a down cycle, and ASML has seen a slowdown in demand from China. Last October, the company cut its 2025 guidance from a range of 30 billion to 40 billion euros to a range of 30 billion to 35 billion euros due to weakness in markets outside of AI and for delayed orders, as the business is more than just EUVs.\n\nHowever, regardless of that recent weakness, ASML still looks like a good bet for long-term growth thanks to its position as the lone maker of EUV equipment and due to the growth in the semiconductor industry. The company only sells about 100 machines each quarter, so its business is naturally lumpy, but it's still growing. In the first quarter, it reported 46% top-line year-over-year growth to 7.74 billion euros.\n\nASML is targeting 44 billion to 60 billion euros in revenue in 2030 with a gross margin of 56% to 60%, up from a target of 51% to 53% this year. If ASML can hit that target, the stock looks like an easy winner, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30 currently.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAnother chip stock also looks like a prime candidate to buy on the dip. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%) stock is down roughly 40% from its peak last year. Like ASML, AMD has begun to bounce off its earlier lows as the company is building momentum in AI and beyond. It's also benefited from the perception that it's the strongest alternative to Nvidia in the data center GPU market.\n\nIn the first quarter, AMD reported revenue growth of 36% to $7.44 billion, driven by a 57% jump in the data center business to $3.7 billion in revenue, which management attributed to growth in its Epyc CPU and Instinct GPU chips.\n\nIts client segment, focused on PCs, reported 68% growth to $2.3 billion, showing it's taking market share from rival Intel and seeing strong demand for its Zen 5 Ryzen processors.\n\nThat momentum and the massive demand connected to AI should favor AMD. The company is also making several acquisitions to boost its position in AI and beyond, including its recent acquisition of ZT Systems, a maker of servers, helping AMD vertically integrate downstream, though it sold off the manufacturing business, choosing to retain the design and customer service teams and benefit from ZT's expertise in rack-scale solutions. It's also acquired some AI start-ups.\n\nAMD now trades at a forward P/E of 33 based on adjusted EPS estimates, and the company looks poised for long-term growth in AI and other areas in the chip industry, thanks to its broad range of components, growth momentum, and recent acquisitions. After a long slide, AMD looks ready for a recovery.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:22:23.421986+00:00"}

(AMS:ASML)", "summary": "Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, ASML Holding fair value estimate is €609 Current share price...", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-asml-holding-090229878.html", "published_at": "2025-06-20T09:02:29Z", "source": "Simply Wall St.", "text": "Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nHow far off is ASML Holding N.V. ( AMS:ASML ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nThe €766 analyst price target for ASML is 26% more than our estimate of fair value\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €20b× (1 + 1.5%) ÷ (8.0%– 1.5%) = €314b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= €314b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= €146b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is €239b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of €653, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\n\nENXTAM:ASML Discounted Cash Flow June 20th 2025\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ASML Holding as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.495. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for ASML Holding\n\nSWOT Analysis for ASML Holding\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Dutch market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.
