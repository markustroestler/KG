They’ve done smaller deals, but this week they caught the biggest fish yet: a $29 billion financing package for Meta Platforms Inc.’s massive data center in Louisiana.\n\nThat transaction, led by Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc., hits all the high notes: It’s a top-notch business in a hot sector. It disrupts the usual route that companies like Meta travel to get money from investors through banks. And, it’s huge.\n\n“Private credit has been itching to get into this space,” said John Medina, senior vice president on the global project and infrastructure finance team at Moody’s Ratings. “This deal is one of the first of its kind for private credit and if it is successful, we would expect to see more.”\n\nThe biggest technology companies are in an AI arms race now, and they need cash to win. Elon Musk’s xAI Corp. recently told investors it plans to spend $18 billion on data centers, and is looking at raising debt backed by projects rather than at the corporate level. Others including Amazon.com Inc. and OpenAI Inc. are pursuing their own sites across the US. Morgan Stanley estimates that capital expenditures on AI could exceed $3 trillion in the next three years.\n\nFor Meta, Pimco is leading $26 billion in debt and Blue Owl is providing $3 billion in equity. The debt portion is likely to be issued in the form of investment-grade bonds backed by the data center’s assets, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the final structure is still in flux. Morgan Stanley is advising Meta on the deal and arranging the financing.\n\nThe bidding war for the financing lasted months. It was competitive because private credit firms have been all-but-begging for access to the investment-grade debt world that banks dominate. Other private credit firms that grappled for the top spot include Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co., which made it to the final round, as well as Brookfield Asset Management Ltd., Blackstone Inc. and Ares Management Corp., said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-09T08:38:59.623808+00:00"}

It also accounts for some of Nvidia’s most important, though often overlooked, offerings: its networking technologies.\n\nComposed of its NVLink, InfiniBand, and Ethernet solutions, Nvidia’s networking products are what allow its chips to communicate with each other, let servers talk to each other inside massive data centers, and ultimately ensure end users can connect to it all to run AI applications.\n\n“The most important part in building a supercomputer is the infrastructure.

Nvidia’s networking sales accounted for $12.9 billion of its $115.1 billion in data center revenue in its prior fiscal year. That might not seem impressive when you consider that chip sales brought in $102.1 billion, but it eclipses the $11.3 billion that Nvidia’s second-largest segment, Gaming, took in for the year.\n\nIn Q1, networking made up $4.9 billion of Nvidia’s $39.1 billion in data center revenue. And it’ll continue to grow as customers continue to build out their AI capacity, whether that’s at research universities or massive data centers.\n\n“It is the most underappreciated part of Nvidia's business, by orders of magnitude,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “Basically, networking doesn't get the attention because it's 11% of revenue. But it's growing like a rocket ship.”\n\nConnecting thousands of chips\n\nWhen it comes to the AI explosion, Nvidia senior vice president of networking Kevin Deierling says the company has to work across three different types of networks. The first is its NVLink technology, which connects GPUs to each other within a server or multiple servers inside of a tall, cabinet-like server rack, allowing them to communicate and boost overall performance.\n\nThen there’s InfiniBand, which connects multiple server nodes across data centers to form what is essentially a massive AI computer. Then there’s the front-end network for storage and system management, which uses Ethernet connectivity.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang presents a Grace Blackwell NVLink72 as he delivers a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025.

Investors were not enthused. The stock dipped 10% and is now trailing the valuation of its big technology peers, with Nvidia and Microsoft having market caps of around twice the size of Amazon today. Wall Street is concerned about slower growth in cloud computing and Amazon falling behind in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis pins the stock down on one topic when in reality Amazon has all the ingredients to keep growing its profits over the long term, which is what will drive the share price higher. Here's why Amazon -- with a market cap of $2.3 trillion right now -- can finish 2025 valued at over $3 trillion.\n\nMore profits arriving in e-commerce\n\nThe biggest reason for Amazon's profit expansion in its e-commerce division the last few years is advertising. High-margin advertising revenue has grown from $7.4 billion in the second quarter of 2021 to $15.7 billion last quarter, and is still growing 22% year over year. This division has now generated $61 billion in revenue over the last 12 months and has incredibly strong profit margins.\n\nAdvertising, along with growth in third-party seller services, subscription revenue, and operating leverage over its fixed cost base, has enabled Amazon's North American retail division to expand its profit margin to 7% over the last 12 months. Through the rest of 2025, there is plenty of room for this expansion to keep occurring, which will have a large impact on profitability given how much revenue the division generates ($400 billion over the last 12 months). Even slight profit margin enhancements mean billions of dollars in extra earnings for Amazon.\n\nThe same thing is happening in international markets, where Amazon has a 3.4% operating margin on $150 billion in revenue. These segments are behind North America but have the same business model at the end of the day, meaning there is even more room for margin expansion over the long haul.\n\nOver $500 billion in annual revenue for segments growing revenue in the double digits means Amazon can add tens of billions of dollars in earnings power from North America and international retail in the years to come just by expanding its profit margin slightly each year. Through the rest of 2025, this story will continue to unfold.\n\nSustained cloud computing tailwind\n\nA once shining star of Amazon's business, cloud computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the reason for the stock falling after its latest quarterly result. Revenue grew 17.5% for AWS in the quarter, which was well behind competitors Microsoft and Alphabet.\n\nEven though AWS is growing slower than its peers, it will still benefit greatly from the AI revolution, especially because of its relationship with Anthropic. The fast-growing AI start-up is seeing booming revenue and is planning to spend a boatload of money at AWS, its key partner. This can drive an acceleration of revenue growth for AWS through the rest of 2025. With over $130 billion in annualized sales, AWS is on a path to hitting close to $150 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of 2025.\n\nIts profit margin is also strong, at 37% over the last 12 months. A strong profit margin and fast revenue growth mean huge earnings gains for AWS, which will lead to consolidated earnings gains for Amazon.\n\nThe math to a $3 trillion valuation\n\nOver the last 12 months, Amazon has generated $76 billion in operating income and $70 billion in net income. Through continued margin expansion in retail and fast growth at AWS, both of these figures can keep chugging higher through the end of 2025. In 2026, it is likely that Amazon's annual earnings will be close to or exceed $100 billion.\n\nToday, Amazon trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 33. The S&P 500 index trades at a P/E ratio of close to 30. A forward P/E ratio of 30 and $100 billion in 2026 earnings means that Amazon would trade at a market cap of $3 trillion by the end of this year. That is the math behind Amazon's potential in 2025, and why the stock is set to surge in the next few quarters. Buy Amazon stock and hold on tight for the long term.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T07:36:08.060161+00:00"}

The cohort consists of:\n\nNvidia NVDA 1.05% ) Microsoft MSFT 0.22% ) Apple AAPL 4.24% ) Amazon AMZN -0.20% ) Alphabet GOOG 2.44% ) GOOGL 2.48% ) Meta Platforms META 0.92% ) Tesla TSLA 2.29% )\n\nAll of these companies (except for Nvidia) have reported results, and investors may be curious as to which ones look like solid buys. I think all of these stocks are growing more interesting each day, but of the seven, I think five are a buy and two are to be watched.\n\nI'm keeping an eye on Apple and Tesla\n\nOver the past few years, many of these companies have delivered explosive revenue growth, except for Apple. Apple's growth finally returned in Q3 FY 2025, delivering double-digit growth (if you round up) for the first time since early 2022.\n\nStill, there are some questions about being behind in the AI arms race and what Apple's next big product is. I'm not ready to declare Apple a buy yet, but it's growing more intriguing with each quarter.\n\nTesla is in the worst shape of any Magnificent Seven company, with revenue falling 16% year over year in Q2. Additionally, with EV and regulatory credits getting eliminated, significant headwinds are popping up. However, Tesla's business has never been solely about EVs; otherwise, its valuation wouldn't make sense. An investment in Tesla is a bet that its humanoid robots, AI, self-driving, and rob-taxis will all be successes eventually. But for right now, I'm comfortable waiting on Tesla's situation to improve.\n\nI'm a buyer of the remaining five\n\nThe other five members of the Magnificent Seven all look promising to me, as they're all experiencing strong growth.\n\nMeta Platforms delivered a shocking Q2 report that delivered 22% revenue growth despite only guiding for 13% growth. That strength is expected to continue through Q3, with 20% revenue growth expected.\n\nMeta's advertising business is second to none, and the improvements it's making with AI to aid in ad creation and engagement are starting to pay off.\n\nAlphabet similarly had a strong advertising quarter, despite many investors being worried about Google Search potentially being left behind by generative AI. Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year, showcasing its strength and silencing doubters about its longevity.\n\nCompanywide, Alphabet's revenue rose 14% year over year, with diluted earnings per share rising 22%. That's an impressive result from a company that is supposed to be struggling. Additionally, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading for 20 times forward earnings.\n\nAll of this combines to make Alphabet one of the best stocks to buy right now.\n\nDespite Microsoft being the second-largest company in the world, it delivered monster growth in Q4 FY 2025 (ended June 30). Revenue was up 18% year over year, but the biggest shock in its report was Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing product and is a leading platform for building AI models. Azure's revenue was up a jaw-dropping 39% this quarter, showcasing strong demand for computing power.\n\nThis tailwind will persist for some time, making Microsoft an excellent stock to scoop up now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN -0.20%) investors had a negative reaction to its report, which caused shares to sink following earnings. However, I don't think they were as bad as the market thought, and the long-term outlook is still positive for the company.\n\nAmazon's profit growth continues to outpace revenue growth thanks to the strength of high-margin businesses like advertising and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAs long as this trend continues, Amazon will be a strong long-term pick. With both advertising and AWS being Amazon's fastest-growing segments by far, this trend looks primed to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nLast is Nvidia, which hasn't reported earnings yet. However, all of the companies involved in building out AI infrastructure on this list stated that their capital expenditures will be rising next year due to increased data center spend. This bodes well for Nvidia, as it receives a huge chunk of this spend. Additionally, Nvidia has reapplied for its export license to begin shipping H20 chips to China again, which will provide another growth tailwind for its business.\n\nI expect Nvidia to report blowout earnings on Aug. 27, making the stock a smart stock to scoop up before then. Nvidia may be the world's largest company, but I expect it to get even bigger with increased AI buildout.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T07:36:09.271391+00:00"}

Because a large chunk of its sales comes from data center expenditures, Nvidia investors can look at what some of its largest clients are saying about their capital expenditure plans to determine if Nvidia has a bullish or bearish outlook.\n\nAfter some of the information investors received during the Q2 earnings announcement, it's pretty clear that Nvidia's stock will have another fantastic year. This makes Nvidia a potential buy before Aug. 27, when Nvidia reports its Q2 results.\n\nThe AI hyperscalers are still rapidly building data centers\n\nNvidia's business revolves around selling its graphics processing units (GPUs) and other supporting hardware and software. While GPUs are used in multiple applications, the largest demand by far comes from data centers being built to handle the demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Companies competing in the AI arms race are scrambling to ensure they have enough computing power to handle the workloads and are rapidly building data centers to meet it.\n\nSome of the biggest spenders in this area are Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. All three of these companies have already reported Q2 results and given bullish commentary regarding data center capital expenditures.\n\nStarting with Microsoft, they stated that capital expenditure growth won't be as rapid as it was in fiscal year 2025 (ending June 30), but will still increase for fiscal year 2026.\n\nAlphabet is probably displaying the most aggressive spending behavior of the three, raising its 2025 capital expenditure guidance from $75 billion to $85 billion. While they didn't give details on 2026's capex plans, they mentioned they will further increase this figure to meet customer demand.\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms' capital expenditures are expected to rise $30 billion year over year, with 2025's total expected to be between $66 billion and $72 billion, indicating that its capital expenditures have nearly doubled year over year. For 2026, Meta's management stated, \"We currently expect another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.\"\n\nWith strong guidance appearing for 2026, Nvidia will likely experience an additional year of strong growth as it receives a large chunk of that spend.\n\nHowever, Nvidia also has a growth lever up its sleeve.\n\nNvidia expects China sales to bolster its revenue growth rate moving forward\n\nIn April, Nvidia's China export license was revoked. This crippled sales of its H20 chip, which was specifically designed to meet export regulations. However, Nvidia has reapplied for an export license with assurances from the U.S. government that it will be approved. This is huge news and opens another growth avenue for Nvidia.\n\nFor Q2 of fiscal year 2025 (ended July 27), Nvidia expects 50% revenue growth. However, management estimated that H20 chips would have added around $8 billion in sales during Q2 if their export license hadn't been revoked. If nothing had happened, Nvidia's sales would have been estimated to rise 77% year over year.\n\nWith H20 chip sales likely returning in Q3, this will also bolster Nvidia's growth rate for the next year.\n\nNvidia has several strong tailwinds blowing in its favor that will push its revenue higher. So, if you're worried about Nvidia's growth slowing, I wouldn't be, as all signs point toward Nvidia's growth remaining strong for at least another couple of years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:21.534902+00:00"}

SK Hynix's projections are conservative and include constraints such as available energy, he said.\n\nBut the memory business is undergoing a significant strategic change during this period as well. HBM - a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 - involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, helping to process the large volumes of data generated by complex AI applications.\n\nSK Hynix expects this market for custom HBM to grow to tens of billions of dollars by 2030, Choi said.\n\nDue to technological changes in the way SK Hynix and rivals such as Micron Technology and Samsung Electronics build next-generation HBM4, their products include a customer-specific logic die, or \"base die\", that helps manage the memory.\n\nThat means it is no longer possible to easily replace a rival's memory product with a nearly identical chip or product.\n\nPart of SK Hynix's optimism for future HBM market growth includes the likelihood that customers will want even further customisation than what SK Hynix already does, Choi said.\n\nAt the moment it is mostly larger customers such as Nvidia that receive individual customisation, while smaller clients get a traditional one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n\"Each customer has different taste,\" Choi said, adding that some want specific performance or power characteristics.\n\nSK Hynix is currently the main HBM supplier to Nvidia, although Samsung and Micron supply it with smaller volumes.

He had already become the wealthiest person in the world, reaching centibillionaire status briefly in 1999. He slowly stepped back from the company he founded over the next 20 years, ultimately resigning from its board in 2020.\n\nGates' focus over the last 25 years has shifted from building a leading technology company to solving some of the world's toughest health, equality, and educational challenges through the Gates Foundation. In that time, he and ex-wife Melinda French Gates donated about $60 billion of their wealth, making them two of the biggest donors in history. Their philanthropic giving is only outdone by Gates' friend Warren Buffett, who has been a longtime donor to his foundation.\n\nWhile Gates' fortune was built on Microsoft, he's mostly followed Buffett's investing style when it comes to his personal portfolio and that of the Gates Foundation trust fund. Buffett is a big proponent of the idea of putting a lot of your capital to work in just a few outstanding companies. As a result, over two-thirds of the Gates Foundation's trust's marketable equity portfolio is held in just three marvelous stocks all reflecting the combined influence of Gates and Buffett.\n\n1. Microsoft (33%)\n\nThe majority of Gates' wealth comes from his stake in Microsoft, the company he co-founded in 1975. After his most recent donation to the Gates Foundation in 2022, Gates' stake in the company fell to less than 1%. Of course, 1% of a $4 trillion company is still $40 billion.\n\nThe Gates Foundation still holds a significant stake in Microsoft as well, even though it regularly sells shares to fund its operations. As of its most recent 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Gates Foundation held 28.5 million shares of Microsoft. Those shares are worth $14.8 billion as of this writing.\n\nMicrosoft's seeing strong results across its cloud computing business, Azure, as well as its core enterprise software. Both are benefiting from growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAzure is now a $75 billion business, up 34% over the past year, generating a strong operating margin for Microsoft. Not only that, but Azure revenue is accelerating, as demand continues to outstrip supply. Microsoft is investing tens of billions of dollars in building capacity for AI training and inference.\n\nOn the software side of the business, management is seeing strong adoption of its Copilot AI agent. Management said it surpassed 100 million monthly active users across its family of Copilot apps. Moreover, its Copilot Studio, which enables businesses to harness their own data to develop custom AI agents, saw customers create 3 million new agents over the past year.\n\nThat's resulted in revenue acceleration over the past year (up 18% last quarter) as well as margin expansion. Earnings per share climbed an impressive 24% last quarter. While the stock responded positively, increased earnings expectations for the stock mean shares trade for about 34 times earnings estimates. That's an attractive price for the stock with accelerating earnings growth and tens of billions in quarterly free cash flow it can use to invest in future opportunities or return to shareholders.\n\n2. Berkshire Hathaway (17%)\n\nWarren Buffett makes an annual donation of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.40%) (BRK.B 0.83%) shares to the Gates Foundation every summer. Buffett earmarked 10 million Class B shares for the foundation in 2006, or 500 million shares after adjusting for splits. Every year, Buffett donates 5% of the remaining earmarked shares as long as the Gates Foundation's total giving from the previous year is equal to the amount donated in the previous year plus 5% of the foundation's other assets.\n\nDespite that stipulation, the foundation has managed to hold onto a good chunk of Berkshire shares. It counted 17.2 million shares as of the end of March this year. Those shares are worth about $7.9 billion as of this writing. The foundation received another 9.4 million shares on June 30, according to SEC filings.\n\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway suffered since the company's annual meeting in May, when Buffett announced his resignation as CEO effective Jan. 1. While some of that is due to a loss of the \"Buffett premium\" some shareholders may have put on Berkshire Hathaway, the company has also faced some challenges.\n\nThe insurance business saw outstanding results in 2024, but that's normalized in 2025. Price increases haven't added meaningful revenue while increases in payouts in the first quarter led to worse underwriting results.\n\nAdditionally, Buffett hasn't seen very many opportunities to invest Berkshire's capital, leading him to leave a lot of cash on the sidelines even as stock prices continue to rise. In fact, Buffett's been a net seller of stocks for 11 consecutive quarters. Berkshire ended the second quarter with $344 billion in cash and equivalents, significantly more in value than its marketable equities.\n\nBuffett hasn't even found Berkshire shares particularly attractive, passing on the opportunity to buy back shares with Berkshire's cash hoard. Even after the pullback in price, shares trade for roughly 1.5 times book value. That's around the valuation where Buffett initially stopped repurchasing shares.\n\nHowever, if the stock falls meaningfully below that 1.5-times-book-value threshold, Buffett might resume buying shares, and investors should consider buying up the stock at that price as well. Berkshire's operations remain strong and the opportunity for Buffett or his team of investment managers to make a move with $344 billion at their disposal holds a lot of potential value.\n\n3. Waste Management (17%)\n\nWaste Management (WM 0.80%) is a boring stock that the Gates Foundation Trust has held in its portfolio for decades. In fact, it's added to its stake in the company, and it now holds 35.2 million shares (up from 1.2 million shares in 2002). Those shares are worth about $7.5 billion as of this writing.\n\nThe waste collection and disposal company has seen strong organic growth over the last few years, with revenue climbing 6% per year from 2022 through 2024. That's continued in 2025, growing 5.4% in its most recent quarter.\n\nOn top of that organic growth, management has made strategic acquisitions that have been accretive. Its most recent acquisition, Stericycle, pushed Waste Management into the medical waste space. Rebranded as WM Healthcare Solutions, the business contributed about 10% of Waste Management net operating revenue in the second quarter.\n\nThe company managed to produce strong operating margins despite taking on the lower-margin medical waste business. Last quarter's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 29.9% was essentially in line with last year's margin without the Healthcare Solutions business. As management unlocks synergies in the acquisition and scales the business, it should see strong improvements in profitability over time.\n\nThat margin expansion is supported by Waste Management's incomparable position in the industry thanks to its landfill portfolio. New entrants face high barriers to entry as regulatory hurdles make it impractical to develop new landfills. Additionally, Waste Management's scale gives it a better margin profile as it's able to develop denser routes and benefit from economies of scale.\n\nDespite Waste Management's dominant position in the industry, the stock trades at a lower valuation than its two biggest competitors. At an enterprise value of 15 times forward EBITDA estimates, it's a fair price to pay for a company with expanding EBITDA margins and strong organic revenue growth.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:30.843354+00:00"}

That hasn't stopped investor interest, as quantum computing stocks are some of the hottest on the market right now.\n\nIf you're looking to get in on the quantum computing investment trend, I've got a few solid picks that make for smart buys now and help balance out the risk that comes with investing in this space.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 2.44%) (GOOGL 2.48%) is the parent company of Google and many other brands. It's well known for using the resources that its Google Search engine generates to invest in various technologies and see what comes out of it. One of the more promising investment areas in quantum computing, and its breakthroughs kick-started the quantum computing investment race in December 2024.\n\nGoogle's Willow chip completed an incredibly difficult computing task rapidly, and this made investors realize that quantum computing could be coming soon. This chip performed a task in five minutes that would have taken traditional computing 10 septillion years (10 to the 25th power), showcasing its impressive capabilities.\n\nAlphabet is heavily investing in quantum computing because it can bolster its AI goals. Additionally, with its massive cloud computing business, offering a quantum computing solution of its own eliminates the need for intermediaries (like how it needs Nvidia GPUs now), allowing this segment to become far more profitable.\n\nWith Alphabet, it doesn't need quantum computing to be a successful investment, but if it succeeds, it will be a great boost to Alphabet's existing business.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.22%) is in almost the same boat as Alphabet. It's developing a quantum computing capability in-house in an attempt to cut out the middleman to make more profits.\n\nMicrosoft has done extensive work in this field, and even claims to have created a new state of matter for its Majorana 1 chip. Microsoft has a ton of spare cash to invest in this technology, so it should be seen as a huge threat in the quantum computing space.\n\nAdditionally, CEO Satya Nadella is a believer in the technology, and he believes that the next big accelerator in its cloud computing business will be quantum-related. With Microsoft working on widespread quantum computing availability, it looks like a solid stock to buy in the quantum realm.\n\nIonQ\n\nWhile Alphabet and Microsoft are both viable competitors in the quantum computing realm, their upside is limited because they have ancillary businesses that may overshadow the benefits of a booming quantum computing business.\n\nThat's why pure plays such as IonQ (IONQ 3.41%) are popular too, as their stocks stand to skyrocket if they're successful. IonQ is my top pure-play quantum computing pick because of the approach that it's taking.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, and many other competitors are taking a superconducting approach, which requires cooling a particle to near absolute zero. IonQ's trapped ion approach can be done at room temperature, which makes it far more cost-effective. IonQ estimates that it costs less than $50 million for its machines versus $1 billion for superconducting computers.\n\nThat's a huge difference, and having an easily scalable and low-cost quantum computing platform is key to success for emerging technologies. Ultimately, IonQ may not be a winner, as there could be an unknown hurdle it cannot clear while developing its product. As a result, investors should keep position sizing for IonQ relatively small, so that if it goes to $0, it doesn't have a huge effect on a portfolio. But if it succeeds, it can provide portfolio-changing returns.\n\nQuantum computing could be the next biggest technology. By having some exposure to this trio, investors can benefit from a massive long-term trend that could define the next decade of investing.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:32.100943+00:00"}

It was knocked from the top thanks to a lack of growth and innovation, but it was still a best-in-class operator that was well managed.\n\nAs of Apple's most recent results, the issue of lack of growth has been resolved, as Apple managed to post its quickest growth rate in years. But is it enough to make Apple a solid stock to buy now?\n\nApple is behind in AI\n\nApple is the leading consumer tech brand in the U.S., and it is also popular around the world. It rose to this position through continuous innovation and always having some of the best products available. However, it has fallen behind in a key area: Artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIt's no secret that Apple Intelligence (Apple's take on AI) hasn't lived up to the hype, and has failed to launch several key features that it promised would be launched last year. Whether these features will make a difference in selling more phones is up for debate, but this is just one area where Apple has fallen behind recently.\n\nCEO Tim Cook hinted at one way Apple may be open to catching up in the AI race: Acquisitions. On Apple's third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call (ending June 28), Cook mentioned that management is open to making an AI acquisition, and is not concerned about the size of the company. Depending on which company Apple scoops up, this could propel Apple from an AI laggard to an AI leader, and could be the next technological innovation it needs to get back on top.\n\nApple's revenue growth lags compared to its peers\n\nEven without AI, Apple's growth has finally returned. In Q3, Apple's revenue was up 10% year over year. While that's not rapid growth by any means, it's at least market-matching and is a big improvement from where it has been.\n\nIf Apple can continue this trend and return to mid-teens growth, Apple could finally start to justify its valuation.\n\nEven though Apple's growth has been lackluster over the past few years, it still maintains a premium valuation in the market. The argument was that Apple is Apple, and it will eventually return to growth mode. Still, despite Apple's successful quarter, it remains a pricey stock.\n\nAt 31 times trailing earnings and 28 times forward earnings, Apple's stock still trades at the high end of its range over the past four years. Furthermore, Apple is more expensive than the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which trades for 25 times trailing earnings and 24 times forward earnings.\n\nAdditionally, if you compare Apple to its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, it also looks rather expensive for its growth.\n\nCompany Last Quarter Revenue Growth Rate Forward P/E Ratio Apple 9.6% 27.5 Nvidia 69.2% 41.4 Microsoft 18.1% 34.0 Amazon 13.3% 32.5 Alphabet 13.8% 19.7 Meta Platforms 21.3% 27.6 Tesla (11.8%) 183.0\n\nCompanies like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) provide better growth at a cheaper or similar price tag. But if Apple can improve its growth into the low double-digit range, it will start to look like an attractive pick compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) or Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nI don't think Apple is a buy just yet, although it's getting close. I want to see what happens to Apple once its supply of iPhones -- its most important product -- runs out in the U.S., and it has to deal with tariffs.\n\nApple is an improving story, but I'm not quite ready to invest in it yet.

This summer, it is Amazon (AMZN -0.23%) that has begun to fall behind the pack.\n\nThe cloud computing, e-commerce platform, and logistical infrastructure giant saw its stock drop 10% from highs after reporting slower growth in its cloud computing division compared to the competition. However, if you are an investor focused on the long term, you know that it is better to focus on the broad forest while Wall Street looks at the individual trees.\n\nHere's why Amazon stock is set to soar for the rest of the decade and can become larger than Nvidia and Palantir combined in 2030.\n\nFalling behind in cloud computing?\n\nIn the second quarter, Amazon's cloud computing division -- Amazon Web Services, or AWS -- posted 17.5% revenue growth to $30.9 billion. Or, an annualized rate of $123.6 billion. However, this was much slower growth than the competition such as Microsoft Azure, which posted 34% revenue growth due to its large relationship with OpenAI, which is spending like gangbusters on cloud computing services.\n\nInvestors see this dichotomy in growth as a warning sign for AWS. Is it falling behind Microsoft? While it would be nice if Amazon won the OpenAI relationship, it is not getting left out to dry in AI.\n\nAWS has a large relationship with Anthropic, the second-largest AI start-up, which is valued at close to $200 billion. Revenue for Anthropic is exploding, hitting $5 billion in annualized sales in July compared to $4 billion a month prior. Anthropic has committed billions of dollars to spend on AWS, which will help accelerate revenue growth for the division.\n\nWhile Microsoft and others have narrowed the gap, AWS is still the leader in cloud computing today and should benefit from the rising tide of AI spending in the years to come. This will drive revenue and earnings higher for the segment. Operating income was $43 billion for AWS over the last 12 months, and could rise to close to $100 billion by 2030.\n\nA margin expansion story\n\nInvestors may have forgotten the original heartbeat of Amazon's business: e-commerce and its Prime subscription service. North American e-commerce sales are still growing in the double digits, up 11% last quarter to $100 billion and $404 billion over the last 12 months. International -- which includes Western Europe, Japan, and India, among other regions -- has hit $150 billion in trailing-12-month sales.\n\nGrowth of 22% in advertising services is driving margin expansion for Amazon's retail divisions. Over the last 12 months, North American retail has an operating margin of 7% and international a margin of 3.4%.\n\nThis is while Amazon keeps reinvesting in moonshot projects such as Alexa and Project Kuiper, as well as reinvestments into fast delivery services into rural areas of the United States. As these investments either bear operating leverage or are phased out, Amazon's retail divisions will keep expanding profit margins. I expect North American margin to scale to at least 15% due to advertising revenue and 10% for international by 2030, although the path will likely not be linear.\n\nWhy Amazon can beat Nvidia and Palantir\n\nWhich brings me back to Nvidia and Palantir, two behemoths with a combined market cap of $5 trillion. There are three reasons I think Amazon can outpace these AI winners and be the largest company in the world by 2030.\n\nFirst, Amazon has two growth engines at its back: cloud computing and e-commerce/retail. This greatly expands Amazon's addressable market. Even with its overall revenue pushing past $670 billion, there is still plenty of room for the company to keep growing its sales in the years to come. Margin expansion will lead to even high profits for the company.\n\nSecond, Amazon is a customer of Nvidia. It aims to reduce its reliance on the advanced computer chip maker, with its Trainium chip taking on more capacity every quarter. This is market share being taken away from Nvidia.\n\nThird, Amazon has a much cheaper valuation than Nvidia or Palantir. Nvidia has a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 41 compared to 33 for Amazon. Palantir's is a sky-high 278 and will be a major drag on the stock in the coming years. Add it all up, and I think Amazon has a chance to have a much larger market cap by 2030 while Nvidia and Palantir will struggle to grow, making Amazon a better buy for investors at current prices.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:34.978807+00:00"}

That's great news for Nvidia (NVDA 1.05%) investors. Let's see what's happening and why investors should get excited about what Nvidia will have to say when it reports quarterly earnings later this month.\n\nWinning with AI\n\nAI has become an enormous growth driver for tech companies, and really all kinds of companies. It unlocks productivity and aids in creativity in ways that make it essential if a company doesn't want to be left behind.\n\nAmazon said that its AI business through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division continues to grow at triple digits year over year, \"with more demand than we have supplied for at the moment.\" It's launching all sorts of new features as demand grows and changes, and releasing powerful new tools aimed at developers creating large language models and in need of the highest-power AI chips. It also boasted that it rolled out new EC2 instances, a type of virtual server on the AWS cloud supported by new Nvidia Blackwell \"super chips,\" the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) on AWS.\n\nAmazon spent $31.4 billion on capital expenditures, which it says is a reasonable estimate for the back half of the year. Although that could be in many parts of the business, it said the AI business is where most of it is going. That means it could be spending even more than the original $100 billion it said it would spend in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft boasted that its Azure cloud business is grabbing market share, up 34% year over year in the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter (ended June 30), and that it now has 400 data centers, the most of any other cloud business. Management highlighted that while there's industry talk about the first gigawatt or multi-gigawatt data centers, it launched two gigawatts of power in its data centers over the past 12 months, and it's scaling faster than the competition.\n\nAt Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed many exciting developments in AI, including the launch of Meta Superintelligence Labs, which combines all of the company's AI efforts, and progress on upgrades to its Llama LLMs. In April, Nvidia announced its own involvement in the new Llama developments. Zuckerberg said Meta is working on the next generation of products \"that will push the frontier in the next\n\nyear or so.\" Meta has made headlines over the last few weeks as it crafts a team of AI specialists it's been pulling from rival companies.\n\nApple continues to disappoint, or at least confuse, investors with its AI developments. It's taking its time to develop an AI infrastructure that rivals the competition, and it's questionable whether or not it's losing ground or if it's going to eventually release something different and special, which is its signature. Management said it's making substantial investments in AI and that its capital expenditures are going to increase.\n\nAlthough investors seemed disappointed in Apple's AI updates, there's no question that it provided an excellent report, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines, and it's likely to report progress in Apple Intelligence over the coming quarters.\n\nDriving AI\n\nThe common denominator here is Nvidia, which partners with all of these companies. It provides the power for Amazon's and Microsoft's clientele to develop potent LLMs and AI agents, and they also use Nvidia GPUs for the data centers that drive their own LLMs. Meta uses Nvidia's GPUs for its own LLMs and AI agents, and Apple partners with Nvidia for its AI business as well.\n\nNvidia is guiding for sales to increase about 50% over last year in the fiscal second quarter, which it will report on Aug. 27.

And investors have started placing bets on just where that disruption will occur next, ditching shares in companies some strategists expect will see falloffs in demand as AI applications become more widely adopted.\n\nAmong them are web-development firms like Wix.com Ltd., digital-image company Shutterstock Inc. and software maker Adobe Inc. The trio are part of a basket of 26 companies Bank of America strategists identified as most at risk from AI. The group has underperformed the S&P 500 Index by about 22 percentage points since mid-May after more or less keeping pace with the market since ChatGPT’s debut in late 2022.\n\n“The disruption is real,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the Futurum Group. “We thought it would happen over five years. It seems like it is going to happen over two. Service-based businesses with a high headcount, those are going to be really vulnerable, even if they have robust businesses from the last era of tech.”\n\nSo far, few companies have failed as a result of the proliferation of chatbots and so-called agents that can write software code, answer complex questions and produce photos and videos. But with tech giants like Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. pouring hundreds of billions into AI, investors have started to get more defensive.\n\nWix.com and Shutterstock are down at least 33% in 2025, compared with a 8.6% advance for the broad benchmark.

Currently, graphics processing units (GPUs), such as those made by Nvidia, are the most powerful computing devices available that aren't dedicated to a single task. While these devices certainly aren't expected to go obsolete, they could be supplemented by quantum computing, and the future looks to be growing brighter for the technology.\n\nTech giant Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%) had some positive things to say about quantum computing, and it could start to make stocks in this industry more attractive to investors. But is now the right time to buy quantum computing stocks?\n\nCEO Satya Nadella is excited about the future of quantum computing\n\nDuring Microsoft's Q4 FY 2025 (ending June 30) earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella had this to say about quantum computing:\n\nThe next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum, and I am excited about our progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operational deployment of a Level 2 quantum computer, in partnership with Atom Computing.\n\nThis quote tells investors a few things. First, cloud computing is a big deal for Microsoft. At its core, the cloud computing industry is essentially one company building excess computing power and renting it out to clients that need more computing power.\n\nThis has two main use cases: First, when a company doesn't want to handle storing data on its own servers or wants to run workloads on the cloud rather than in-house. Businesses are starting to move more and more of their data to the cloud, and companies like Microsoft and its Azure cloud computing product stand to benefit.\n\nThe second big use case for cloud is for heavy workloads, such as artificial intelligence (AI) model training. Many companies utilize Azure to run AI workloads on it because they don't have the funds to justify building their own supercomputer. This has been a huge growth driver for Azure in recent quarters, and is one of the primary reasons why Azure's growth rate was 39% in the latest quarter.\n\nThe second item this quote tells us is that Microsoft is getting closer to having useful quantum computing. Microsoft states that its Level 2 computer will have resilient logical qubits. This stage will be focused on eliminating background noise and delivering a product that can produce reliable results. Once it completes its Level 2 activities, it will move to Level 3, which involves achieving scale and producing quantum supercomputers.\n\nOnce that last stage is complete, it could usher in a brand-new arms race, and if Microsoft is the first to offer this computing power to its clients, it could give it a huge head start over the competition.\n\nBut what kind of growth can investors expect?\n\nQuantum computing may not have the effect on its stock that some expect\n\nWe're still a few years out from seeing quantum supercomputers on the market. Most companies point to 2030 as a key turning date for quantum computing, so investors shouldn't expect to see any major uses before that date.\n\nAfter that, there are many estimates as to what the quantum computing market will look like. Rigetti Computing points to a projection that states the annual value for quantum computing will be between $15 billion and $30 billion annually starting in 2030.\n\nConsidering Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud division generated nearly $30 billion in Q4 alone, quantum computing likely won't be a huge growth driver for Microsoft. Companywide, Microsoft's revenue was $76.4 billion in Q4, so if Microsoft dominates the quantum computing market and Rigetti's market prediction comes true, quantum computing won't be a massive growth driver.\n\nThe only real explosive growth in the quantum computing realm is if one of the pure plays (such as Rigetti Computing) turns out to be a winner. If a giant like Microsoft rises to the top, it will be just another business unit adding more revenue to the tech giant.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:40.748692+00:00"}

Its chips can be found in popular consumer products like Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox, and even the infotainment systems inside Tesla's electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, AMD's biggest opportunity right now is in the data center. The company is planning to launch a new lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI development in 2026, which could blow the competition -- including Nvidia (NVDA 1.05%) -- out of the water.\n\nAMD stock is up 34% in 2025 already, but it's still below its all-time high just north of $200, which was set last year. Should investors scoop it up while it's still trading at a discount? Read on to find out.\n\nAMD is catching up to Nvidia in the data center space\n\nAMD launched its flagship MI300X data center GPU at the end of 2023, more than a year after Nvidia's industry-leading H100 GPU hit the market. Despite being behind, AMD still managed to attract some of Nvidia's largest customers, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms.\n\nWhile Nvidia continues to leap ahead of the competition with new GPU architectures like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, AMD is quickly closing the gap. It just started shipping its MI350 series GPUs, which are based on a new architecture the company calls Compute DNA (CDNA) 4. These new chips offer 35 times more performance than CDNA 3 versions like the original MI300X, placing them on par with Nvidia's Blackwell lineup.\n\nIn fact, the latest MI355 offers comparable performance to Nvidia's Blackwell GB200 GPU, and it delivers up to 40% more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) in AI inference workloads for the same cost. In other words, it's much cheaper to run over the long term without sacrificing any processing power, which is why it's attracting hyperscalers and even leading AI start-ups like OpenAI.\n\nBut customers' attention is already turning to 2026, when AMD plans to release its MI400 series. These new chips will be combined with specialized software and hardware systems to create a fully integrated AI data center rack called Helios, which will supercharge their performance. AMD CEO Lisa Su believes these MI400-based Helios systems will be the most powerful in the world when they launch, offering a staggering 10 times more performance over the MI350 series.\n\nSimply put, 2026 could be the year that AMD overtakes Nvidia in the AI data center space, at least in terms of technological capability.\n\nAMD's AI data center revenue hit a speed bump in Q2\n\nAMD generated a record $7.7 billion in total revenue during the second quarter of 2025, which was a 32% increase from the year-ago period. The data center segment was responsible for $3.2 billion of that revenue on its own, but it only mustered 14% growth, which was somewhat disappointing given the competitive, high-stakes nature of the GPU market.\n\nExport restrictions were recently imposed by the U.S. government, and they wiped out AMD's AI GPU sales to China, which was the main reason for the underperformance in its data center segment. However, the company says it has applied for licenses to resume sales, and they are currently under review by the Trump administration.\n\nBut there was great news in other areas of AMD's business, like its client segment, where revenue soared 67% year over year to $2.5 billion. This is where the company accounts for sales of its Ryzen AI chips for personal computers, which come with a built-in GPU, central processing unit (CPU), and neural processing unit (NPU). They are installed in a growing number of computers from leading brands like Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus.\n\nAMD's gaming business also roared back to life in Q2, with revenue surging by 73% to $1.1 billion. Revenue declined in this segment last year, and also during the first quarter of 2025, but demand for some of the company's core products is starting to rebound. Console manufacturers are increasing their inventories in preparation for the holiday season, and AMD said demand for its new Radeon 9000 series desktop GPUs is exceeding supply.\n\nShould you buy AMD stock while it's under $200?\n\nDespite the temporary regulatory headwind in AMD's data center business, Lisa Su is as optimistic as ever about its potential. She believes the company's AI revenue will scale into the tens of billions of dollars per year over the long term, driven by the MI400 GPU, which is already experiencing strong customer interest even though it won't hit the market until next year.\n\nOn that note, is AMD stock a buy while it's still below its record high? The company generated $3.45 in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) over the last four quarters, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46.8. That means it's notably cheaper than Nvidia stock, which is sitting at a P/E ratio of 55.7.\n\nMoreover, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests AMD could deliver $5.97 in EPS during 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 27.1. That leaves room for significant upside, because the stock would have to soar by 73% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 46.8.\n\nIt's possible AMD stock will perform even better if the MI400 series blows the competition out of the water next year, like Su expects, so it could be a great addition to any diversified portfolio right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T09:50:42.022450+00:00"}

However, quantum computing is now promising to be the next paradigm-shifting technology. This transformative technology aims to reshape computational capabilities across every industry.\n\nDespite the high future growth potential, monetization opportunities in quantum computing are still limited. Therefore, it makes sense for investors to select companies involved in quantum computing that are already generating revenue and profits. Here are three top-notch companies that can give investors exposure to the quantum computing revolution with limited risk.\n\nNvidia\n\nSemiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA 1.05%) is the undisputed leader in accelerated computing. Thanks to its critical role in building the global AI infrastructure (hardware and software), the company is generating massive cash flows. This, in turn, allowed it to invest in technologies like quantum computing.\n\nNvidia is not building quantum computing chips directly. Instead, it announced the launch of Nvidia DGX Quantum, the first GPU-accelerated quantum computing system globally. The system is powered by Nvidia's advanced Grace Hopper Superchip (CPU+GPU) and open-source CUDA Quantum programming model.\n\nNvidia is providing the essential software and hardware infrastructure that quantum developers require today. Hence, Nvidia plans to start generating revenue even though the quantum industry has not yet matured.\n\nNvidia has already formed partnerships with companies including IQM Quantum Computers, Pasqal, Honeywell subsidiary Quantinuum, Quantum Brilliance, and Xanadu. These deals allow software developers to work effectively with quantum hardware through Nvidia's platform.\n\nUnlike pure quantum start-ups struggling financially, Nvidia boasts strong profitability. The company generated $60.8 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2025 (ending Jan. 26). Nvidia's revenue surged 69% year over year to $44.1 billion, while net income was up 26% year over year to $18.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending April 27). This financial strength enables the company to invest in new opportunities without risking the core business.\n\nTrading at almost 36 times forward earnings, Nvidia commands a premium valuation. However, as the company provides essential tools that every quantum company needs rather than developing specific quantum hardware, its stock is positioned to grow even higher in the coming years.\n\nInternational Business Machines\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM -2.70%), or IBM, quietly transformed itself from a legacy technology company to a major enterprise AI player that generates revenue through enterprise software sales, consulting services, infrastructure systems, and cloud-based solutions. The company has also been making inroads in the quantum computing space since the 1980s. However, it is only in the past few years that its quantum investments have begun delivering tangible results.\n\nIBM's launch of the 127-qubit Eagle processor in 2021 and the recent deployment of its Quantum System Two in Japan are significant milestones in the company's quantum strategy. The company offers quantum computing capabilities through the IBM Cloud and is powered by its quantum software stack called Qiskit. Qiskit is already the most popular software platform for quantum programming. Through the IBM Quantum Network, over 250 organizations collaborate on practical quantum applications. Since the launch of the quantum business in 2017, the company earned cumulative revenue of around $1 billion from quantum computing initiatives.\n\nUnlike smaller quantum start-ups, IBM has a cash-generating and profitable core business. The company made rapid progress in the enterprise AI segment, as is evident from its generative AI book of business worth $7.5 billion from inception to date. With free-cash-flow guidance of over $13.5 billion for 2025, IBM has sufficient financial flexibility to build quantum capabilities. Yet the company is committed to returning capital and boasts a dividend yield of around 2.69%.\n\nHence, although quantum represents a growing but still modest portion of IBM's business, the technology can prove to be a significant growth catalyst in the long run.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nTechnology giant Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%) is also at the forefront of the emerging quantum computing technology. The company's recent breakthroughs, including creating 24 advanced quantum bits with partner Atom Computing and unveiling the Majorana 1 quantum processor in February 2025, demonstrate its quantum computing leadership.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure Quantum service offers customers cloud-based quantum compute capabilities. The service provides clients access to quantum hardware, quantum software, and quantum services for running quantum programs on real quantum hardware, simulating quantum algorithms, and estimating resources needed to scale quantum programs. Even CEO Satya Nadella recently pointed out that \"The next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum.\"\n\nAzure Quantum offers quantum hardware from various third-party providers such as IonQ, Quantinuum, Pasqal, and Rigetti Computing. Microsoft and Atom Computing have planned to ship commercial quantum computers in 2025, featuring over 1,000 physical qubits (unlike regular binary bits used in traditional computing, which can be expressed either as 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously), thereby starting to monetize its quantum technology. Microsoft achieved the first operational deployment of a Level 2 Quantum computer with Atom Computing in July 2025, marking significant progress toward commercial viability.\n\nMicrosoft is integrating quantum computing with AI to deliver a decisive competitive advantage. In January 2025, the company launched its Quantum Ready program to help businesses prepare for quantum transformation.\n\nIts Azure cloud computing business generated more than $75 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, up 34% year over year. Microsoft's revenue also surged 15% year over year to $281.7 billion, while free cash flow was $71.6 billion in fiscal 2025, which ended June 30. Hence, it is clear that Microsoft has sufficient financial strength to support its quantum ambitions without straining resources.\n\nConsidering all the factors, Microsoft offers a low-risk way of investing in the quantum computing opportunity.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:34:50.530082+00:00"}

You never know when a CEO of a major company is going to mention another business or progress in an innovative field. Microsoft's (MSFT 0.22%) CEO Satya Nadella recently gave some commentary regarding quantum computing, and it could have huge ramifications for companies involved in the field, like IonQ (IONQ 3.41%).\n\nMicrosoft believes quantum computing will be a huge boost for one of its primary businesses, which could lead to major growth for IonQ.\n\nMicrosoft is bullish on quantum computing viability\n\nDuring Microsoft's fourth quarter of fiscal-year 2025 (ending June 30) conference call, Nadella stated: \"The next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum, and I am excited about our progress.\" Following that statement, he discussed how Microsoft recently launched a Level 2 quantum computer, which he describes as a device with reliable logical qubits. While Microsoft is pursuing quantum computing technology, it also supports another business in the field.\n\nMicrosoft has long taken the stance in the cloud computing realm of staying neutral. That's why it offers several of the leading AI models on its platform, beyond its partners. While it's pursuing quantum computing by itself, it also has IonQ's quantum computing platform available for use.\n\nThis is key for a company like IonQ, as all three of the major cloud players are attempting to develop their own quantum computing technology. This could ease barriers to entry, but IonQ already has its quantum hardware available on Microsoft's Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nIf quantum computing ends up being the next big thing for cloud computing and IonQ can beat the competition to the punch, it could enjoy a role similar to Nvidia, which is a great place to be.\n\nI think IonQ has what it takes to reach that spot, as it has a few key advantages over its competition.\n\nIonQ is taking a unique approach to quantum computing\n\nNearly every company in the quantum computing race is taking the same approach: superconducting. This requires cooling a particle to near absolute zero, which is a very expensive proposition. IonQ's trapped ion approach eliminates the need for this, as it can be done at room temperature. Additionally, the trapped ion approach may provide increased error correction due to the ability to connect every qubit in the system. Right now, IonQ is the industry leader, as it holds the current world record in both one-qubit and two-qubit fidelity (a measure of how accurate a calculation is).\n\nIonQ has also laid out a path to building devices with 2 million qubits by 2030, which doubles the 1 million qubits that most companies agree is the minimum amount necessary for quantum computing to achieve commercial relevance.\n\nIf IonQ can win the quantum computing race, there's a huge market opportunity available. Management projects that the total addressable market will be about $87 billion by 2035 -- a massive market considering IonQ's small size.\n\nI think IonQ is one of the best pure-play quantum computing investments that investors can make right now, but that doesn't mean investors should go all-in. There's still a ton of risk involved with IonQ's stock, so investors need to keep their exposure relatively minimal. By devoting no more than 1% of total portfolio value to IonQ, investors won't feel the pain if the stock goes to $0. But if it explodes, that 1% exposure will be all you need to make a massive profit on the investment.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:34:51.702418+00:00"}

But today, that perception is increasingly misleading. The index has never been more concentrated in just a few names than it is right now which introduces risks investors can’t afford to ignore.\n\nNvidia Corp. alone currently represents nearly eight per cent of the S&P 500, the highest weighting for a single stock in the index’s history.

Two AI businesses to consider are ASML Holding (ASML 1.33%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 0.17%), since they provide key hardware to the industry.\n\nThe former makes cutting-edge lithography machines, which are necessary for producing the advanced microchips that power AI systems. AMD, one of Nvidia's top competitors, sells AI chips to cloud computing companies such as Microsoft.\n\nASML and AMD are both strong businesses. But determining which is a better AI investment isn't simple. So let's evaluate them in more detail.\n\nA look into ASML\n\nASML's lithography equipment is essential for manufacturing AI microchips because the technology demands immense computing power. This necessitates shrinking chip components to minuscule dimensions. For instance, a microchip the size of your fingernail contains billions of transistors. ASML's machines support this.\n\nAlthough the Dutch company plays an important role in AI, its stock has struggled in 2025, remaining essentially flat through Aug. 6. Part of this is because management anticipates economic uncertainty ahead as a result of factors such as President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nEven so, ASML expects 2025 sales to rise 15% over 2024's 28.3 billion euros ($33 billion). This is significant since 2024's revenue represents only a 2.6% year-over-year increase. And so far this year, the company is doing well.\n\nThrough two quarters, revenue stood at $18 billion, up from the prior year's $13.4 billion. Operating income rose to $5.8 billion from 2024's $3.7 billion. This robust growth resulted in net income of $5.4 billion, a strong increase over the previous year's $3.3 billion.\n\nThe excellent first-half results were tempered by a third-quarter revenue forecast between $8.6 billion and $9.2 billion. This outlook, when compared to the prior year's sales of $8.9 billion, suggests the current trend of strong year-over-year growth may be slowing down, which contributed to ASML's tepid stock performance.\n\nHow AMD is faring\n\nLike rival Nvidia, AMD stock is having a stellar year. Shares are up 35% in 2025 through Aug. 6. This performance is understandable following the company's second-quarter earnings results. The quarter's revenue reached a record $7.7 billion, a 32% year-over-year increase.\n\nCEO Lisa Su said, \"We are seeing robust demand across our computing and AI product portfolio and are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year.\" In that second half, AMD expects revenue of $8.7 billion, a strong increase over the previous year's $6.8 billion.\n\nDespite the sales growth, AMD exited the second quarter with an operating loss of $134 million compared to operating income of $269 million in the previous year. The substantial drop was due to new U.S. government restrictions introduced earlier this year on the sale of AI chips to China. As a result, AMD could not sell chips it had intended for Chinese customers, forcing the company to write off that inventory by $800 million.\n\nYet this makes its second-quarter sales growth all the more impressive. In the quarter, net income was $872 million, up 229% year over year. Consequently, diluted earnings per share soared 238% to $0.54 in a boon to shareholders.\n\nAMD is working to get government approval to sell AI chips to China again. When that OK is obtained, the company is in a position to deliver more outsize sales growth.\n\nDeciding between ASML and AMD\n\nAMD's outstanding performance, its anticipated third-quarter revenue growth, and an eventual return of sales to China point to it being the superior AI stock versus ASML.\n\nHowever, an important consideration is share price valuation. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.\n\nThe top chart shows ASML's P/E ratio has declined over the past year, indicating its stock's valuation has improved. Compared to AMD's recently rising earnings multiple, as seen in the bottom chart, ASML shares look like a bargain.\n\nASML's short-term sales may slow due to the current macroeconomic uncertainty, but over the long run, it's likely to benefit from the rise of AI. The company sees the technology as a significant chance for growth in semiconductors, similar to previous opportunities like PCs, the internet, and smartphones.\n\nIndustry forecasts support ASML's perspective. The AI sector is projected to grow from $244 billion in 2025 to $1 trillion by 2031. While this market growth is a tailwind for both companies, ASML's attractive valuation makes it look like the more compelling AI stock to buy right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T11:37:29.485435+00:00"}

Lock-up periods prevent company insiders from selling stock, usually for 180 days. When the lockups expire, insider selling sometimes pressures a stock.\n\nCoreWeave Stock: IPO Lockup Ends Thursday?\n\nThe company launched its IPO offering and the lockup normally would be around Sept. 24. In CoreWeaves case, though, the lockup will apparently expire two days after it reports earnings for the second time as a public company.\n\n\"The prospectus is clear: it's going to be two days after this week's earnings report,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Nick del Deo told IBD in an email.\n\nA Citigroup report published today said: \"Heading into Q2 earnings for CoreWeave, we reiterate our bullish stance on AI demand and CRWV's ability to outperform near-term topline targets. Though CoreWeave has an expiring lock-up that frees up 83% of Class A shares beginning the morning of Aug. 15 we believe strong fundamentals can help absorb the increase in float. Specifically, we see room for another double-digit percentage top-line beat possible in Q2 amidst countless signs of inflecting AI demand across the industry.\"\n\nWill Core Scientific Deal Fall Through?\n\nCoreWeave stock has jumped 225% in 2025. But the stock sold off in June after the company announced a deal to acquire Core Scientific (CORZ) in an all-stock deal initially valued at $9 billion. Amid the pullback in CoreWeave stock, some CoreScientific shareholders will reportedly vote against the deal.\n\nCore Scientific also offers data-center infrastructure.\n\nSo the IPO lockup expiration comes at a crucial time. And some Wall Street analysts say it's unclear when the IPO lockup expires.\n\n\"It is unclear,\" Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson told IBD in an email. \"There is some language in the original S1 that leaves it open that they would end the lockup right after reporting the second quarter, but it is ambiguous enough that the date may still be the six month date (Sept. 24).\"\n\nLuria added: \"It is possible that they would do a secondary issuance of locked up shares in order to preempt a lockup up as well. We may get an update on that when they report Tuesday.\"\n\nCoreWeave Stock Technical Rating\n\nCoreWeave operates 33 data centers in the U.S. and Europe. Also, CoreWeave has preferred access to Nvidia's graphic processing units. Its cloud offerings are optimized for training and inference required to perform AI tasks.\n\nFor the June quarter, analyst estimate an adjusted loss of 23 cents per share for CoreWeave stock on revenue of $1.082 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, CoreWeave stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A-minus. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. (A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling.

Until we get more clarity, here’s where things stand:\n\nEarnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nBut growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.\n\nActions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nStocks are not the economy: There’s a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nMind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nInvesting is never a smooth ride: There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nThink long-term: For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T13:44:50.773115+00:00"}

Now that app is being discontinued, Microsoft says, as it directs its users to its Copilot AI chat app instead.\n\nAccording to a new support document, Lens will be retired from iOS and Android devices starting on September 15, 2025, then removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play on November 15, 2025.

This aligns with overall tech sector optimism and positions Microsoft to potentially leverage these advancements in bolstering its revenue and earnings forecasts.\n\nOver a longer five-year period, Microsoft's total shareholder return, including share price appreciation and dividends, stands at 160.48%. This significant return outpaced the overall market, highlighting Microsoft's strong competitive position and growth initiatives. Despite its positive annual return, Microsoft underperformed the US Software industry over the past year. The recent developments could support future revenue growth, forecasted at an annual rate of 11.6%, although it remains below the 20% threshold typically considered high. The positive outlook on earnings, with expectations of reaching $157.3 billion by 2028, may receive a further boost from these partnerships, enhancing earnings predictability and margin stability.\n\nCurrently trading at US$520.84, Microsoft's share price remains at a discount to the consensus price target of US$606.61, reflecting a potential 16.47% upside. This price movement, in conjunction with strategic enhancements and the sustained emphasis on AI and cloud capabilities, could positively impact investor sentiment and contribute to the achievement of revenue and earnings forecasts. However, challenges such as CapEx pressures and industry competition remain critical factors to consider as part of the broader financial outlook.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T13:50:36.330407+00:00"}

The outperformance can be attributed to Alphabet’s strong second-quarter 2025 results that revealed the benefits of AI infusion across its Search business and a surge in Google Cloud revenues.\n\n\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Google Search and other revenues increased 11.7% year over year to $54.19 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.04% and accounting for 56.2% of total revenues. Overall queries and commercial queries on Search continued to grow year over year in the reported quarter.\n\n\n\nGoogle continues to dominate the Search business, handling over 5 trillion queries annually, per Semrush. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. Google accounts for 89.66% market share, followed by Microsoft’s MSFT Bing, with 3.88% share.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues surged 31.7% year over year to $13.62 billion and accounted for 14.1% of the quarter’s total revenues. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.24%. The year-over-year growth was driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core GCP products, AI Infrastructure, and Generative AI Solutions. Google Cloud’s annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion.\n\n\n\nThe strong growth in Search and Google Cloud has helped Alphabet shares outperform its closest peers in the cloud computing domain, Microsoft and Amazon. According to Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s AMZN cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, continues to lead with a 30% market share in the second quarter of 2025, while Alphabet and Microsoft had 20% and 13% market share, respectively.\n\nGOOGL Stock’s Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Push to Boost GOOGL’s Prospects\n\nAlphabet is advancing visual and contextual search capabilities. The Circle to Search feature is now active on more than 300 million devices. The company is adding functionalities to help people explore complex topics and ask follow-up questions without switching apps. For instance, gamers can now use Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI Overview or answers.\n\n\n\nAI Overviews now reach more than 2 billion users per month and are available in over 200 countries across 40 languages. It is now driving over 10% more queries globally. Powered by Gemini 2.5, AI Overviews currently delivers the fastest AI responses in the industry. The combination of lens or Circle to Search, together with AI Overviews, is driving multimodal search usage.\n\n\n\nGoogle’s AI-powered Search features are driving deeper engagement, with AI Mode offering advanced reasoning and multimodal responses. Users are generating queries twice as long as those in traditional searches. The launch of AI Mode in the United States and India — where it currently has more than 100 million monthly active users — is expected to drive further growth.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud is benefiting from its partnership with the likes of NVIDIA and PayPal PYPL. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. PayPal will expand its Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven recommendations, transaction processing and enhanced security. The partnership expands the availability and functionality of PayPal’s payment services and capabilities across a range of Google products.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud’s expanding clientele is expected to boost Alphabet’s top line. In the second quarter of 2025, the number of deals was over $250 million, doubling year over year, and the number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 28% sequentially.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T13:50:38.857525+00:00"}

Well, yes, that’s technically true, but it’s not very exciting or interesting. What’s symbolically bigger and better than $4 trillion? $5 trillion? There we go; now, we’re talking.\n\nLast month, chipmaker Nvidia became the first company in the world to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Currently valued at roughly $4.4 trillion, it achieved the landmark a little more than three years after tech giant Apple became the first $3 trillion company in 2022. Now, a seemingly two-horse race for the first-place $5 trillion trophy is underway.\n\nTale of the Market Tape\n\nTemporarily joining Nvidia, which achieved the landmark on July 10, was Microsoft, which became the second member of the $4 trillion club on July 31 after blowing past earnings expectations. But it exited shortly thereafter, with shares softening enough to bring its market cap back down to $3.9 trillion as of Friday.\n\nAnticipating that both companies would reach $4 trillion, Wedbush analysts wrote in June that they could reach the $5 trillion landmark in the next 18 months, noting the “tech bull market is still early, being led by the AI Revolution.” Both happen to be benefiting from overlapping tailwinds. Microsoft’s Azure is growing at breakneck speed as it has become the leading cloud platform for workplaces. The company’s cloud revenues for its latest fiscal year, which ended on July 31, rose 23% year-over-year to $168 billion. Meanwhile, the cloud computing surge that Microsoft has benefited from, of course, has increased the demand for computing hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia. Demand for hardware to support AI computing has, naturally, led to more promising growth in demand: All told, Nvidia predicted at its March technology conference in San Jose, capital expenditures on data centers will rise to $1 trillion by 2028 from $400 billion last year. As for who will hit $5 trillion with the wind in its sails first, the odds seem to favor the chipmaker:\n\nMicrosoft does earn more money. Net income in its fiscal year ending June 30 was $101.8 billion. Nvidia’s net income for the 12 months ending April 30 was a lesser $76.8 billion — but this ultimately impressive haul was achieved as the United States revoked the company’s license to export to China. (Nvidia is poised to reenter the market after the Trump administration offered assurances last month that it will be granted licenses again.)\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, is growing faster. In Microsoft’s latest quarter ending June 30, net income rose 24% year-over-year to $27 billion, and revenue climbed 18% to $76.4 billion. Nvidia’s net income in its latest quarter ending April 30 increased 26% to $18.7 billion, and revenue jumped 69% to $44 billion. And, again, it achieved that growth even with the ban on Chinese chip exports.\n\nThe Dark Horses: The only other companies with a current market cap above $2 trillion are Apple ($3.4 trillion), Google-owner Alphabet ($2.4 trillion) and Amazon ($2.4 trillion). But, unless Tim Cook rolls up to Apple’s next Worldwide Developers Conference with an iPhone that can teleport you to the French Riviera on your lunch break, these thoroughbreds are likely to remain dark horses.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T14:54:27.153416+00:00"}

Earnings were $2.31 per share compared with a Bloomberg consensus estimate of $2.18.\n\nOn a business segment level, advertising revenue came in at $71.3bn versus expectations of $69.6bn. Search revenue topped out at $54.1bn versus an anticipated $52.7bn. YouTube ad revenue was $9.8bn versus expectations of $9.5bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud Platform revenue hit $13.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $13.1bn.\n\nThe company's outlook for capital expenditures (capex), however, was higher than expected. The tech giant expects to spend $85bn in the year, $10bn more than had been previously expected.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nBen Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the concerns around disruption from artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, Alphabet produced a really good set of numbers in its latest results. Revenues were up 15%, three percentage points better than expected and the search business delivered at the top of its range. The cloud business, meanwhile, was also a strong performer with revenues up 32% so it is encouraging to see the business growing strongly in the face of pressures.\"\n\nHe said that the increase in its capex guidance \"is a very solid raise and should be viewed as a positive, with investment looking to drive away the threat of Chat GPT\".\n\n\"Alphabet has been playing catch up somewhat in the AI arms race, but it is doing well to fend off the likes of Chat GPT,\" said Barringer. \"The big question will be whether it can keep innovating at a pace that allows it to maintain its search monopoly. This boost in investment suggests the fight will continue.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the next big event on the horizon for Alphabet's Google is a judge's ruling in an search antitrust case. Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to issue a ruling on \"remedies\" that follows the Justice Department's victory against the company sometime next month.\n\n\"While it is unlikely to be the end of the saga regardless of the result, any indication that its search monopoly will weaken will not be taken well by the market, especially given the AI threat currently,\" said Barringer. \"This ruling has the potential to either be a clearing event or add to Alphabet’s uncertainties. Investors remain very much in wait and see mode as a result and will remain cool on the stock until that ruling makes it clear what the next steps are.\"\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) – Released fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday 30 July\n\nShares in Microsoft (MSFT) popped nearly 5% on Thursday, following the release of its results, seeing it become the second publicly-traded company ever to cross the $4tn market capitalisation mark.\n\nMicrosoft reported revenue of $76.4bn in the fourth quarter compared to expectations of $73.89bn, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $3.65 compared to expectations of $3.37.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes the Azure cloud, produced $29.88bn in revenue in the final quarter. For the entire fiscal year, this AI division saw revenue surge 34% to a record $75bn.\n\nThe company predicted its capital expenditure for the next fiscal year would top $100bn, a 14% increase from the year prior.\n\nRead more: Shell announces further $3.5bn in share buybacks as profits beat estimates\n\nIt’s the fifth quarter in a row that Microsoft has beaten Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nBarringer said that \"while AI demand is clearly helping Microsoft, it isn’t the only game in town for the tech giant. Its cloud business, Azure, saw revenues grow 39%, well ahead of expectations, highlighting that demand for more traditional cloud based services remains strong. Microsoft has a good backlog in this business area too so we should see strong results continue to flow there.\n\n“The company did announce it was slowing the growth of its capex and changing the mix slightly, but as demand remains strong for AI we will likely see the likes of data centres take priority for a number of years yet.\n\nMeta (META) – Released second quarter results on Wednesday 30 July\n\nFacebook-parent Meta (META) surged 12% on Thursday after posting a bumper set of results after the market close on 30 July.\n\nMeta said revenue for the three months to the end of June rose 22% from the same period last year to $47.5bn. Meanwhile, profits jumped by 36% to $18.3bn. Profit per share came in at $7.14, above analysts' estimates.\n\nThe company said it expected its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114bn and $118bn. The company added its AI initiatives will “result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.”\n\n\"I think there are all these questions that people have about what are going to be the timelines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence ... we've observed the more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen.

Pick your metric and Meta crushed it, from ad revenue growth to daily users, all the way down to the profit lines.\n\n\"AI is clearly delivering real-world benefits for advertisers, and they're willing to pay more as a result. Average price per ad was up 9% over the quarter, a clear indication that Meta is delivering an improved product for both users and advertisers.\n\n\"The broader focus now turns to Meta's mammoth AI investment plans and whether it can continue to manage those costs without hurting earnings or free cash flow.\n\n\"CFO commentary called out higher costs next year, and another year of similar capex growth, which many analysts did not have on their bingo cards. Clearly, all this spending adds some near-term risks to the bottom line, but Meta looks set to be a clear winner in the AI space over the longer term.\"\n\nApple (AAPL) – Released third-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nInvestors in Apple (AAPL) had a muted response to its latest earnings in after-hours trading following their release, despite a surge in iPhone sales driving record revenue at the Cupertino-based company.\n\nThe company posted better-than-expected 10% growth in revenue year-on-year for the quarter to the end of June and an upbeat forecast.\n\nEarnings of $1.57 per share topped the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $1.43. Revenue of $94.04bn was better than the expected $89.30bn. Mac and iPhone revenue were both better than analysts had anticipated, while wearables and iPad numbers fell short. Greater China revenue was $15.37bn compared to an estimate of $15.19bn.\n\nApple expects tariffs to cost the company $1.1bn this quarter, CEO Tim Cook told investors on the earnings call. That's after the iPhone maker took a tariff-related hit to the tune of $800m during the fiscal third quarter which ran through June.\n\nServices revenue, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Pay, came in at $27.4bn, up about 13% year-on-year, continuing its double-digit growth.\n\nCook said Apple (AAPL) was increasing its AI investments. “We did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter,” he told analysts, without giving specific numbers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook warned in a second quarter earnings call at the beginning of May that tariffs were expected to add $900m to costs in the third quarter. · REUTERS / Reuters\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Britzman said: \"Apple is caught in a sentiment trap. On paper, the company delivered one of its strongest sets of results in recent years – robust iPhone sales, a return to growth in China, and encouraging guidance. Ordinarily, that would send shares meaningfully higher. There’s a sense of unease hanging over Apple, something we haven’t seen in a long time. Scepticism around its AI positioning, combined with lingering tariff uncertainty, continues to weigh on investor confidence.\"\n\n\"Apple should be a leading name in AI hardware, but that’s simply not the case,\" he added. \"Apple Intelligence was a flop, so a lot of hope now lies in an AI-powered Siri – but that might not come until next year. Brand loyalty gives Apple time to get the AI transition right, but it needs to start delivering.\"\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – Released second-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nShares in Amazon (AMZN) fell on the back of its second quarter results, as its outlook for operating income fell short of investor expectations.\n\nThe tech company beat estimates with its revenue up 13.3% year over year to $167.7bn. Market experts had estimated the company would report around $162bn in revenue and 9% growth. The company’s Amazon Web Services cloud computing division reported its sales reached $30.9bn in an increase of 17.5% year over year.\n\nHowever, Amazon projected that operating income in the third quarter would be $15.5bn-$20.5bn, which fell short of analyst expectations of $19.4bn.\n\nChief executive Andy Jassy warned of further uncertainty around Trump’s tariff policies and said he remained “unsure” who would absorb potentially higher costs over time.\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nHe also gave a clear indication that the e-commerce giant will continue its AI push. \"AI is going to be the biggest transformation of our lifetime,” he said during a call with analysts on Thursday. “Every single area of the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by AI.\"\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Just as it looked as if investors were ready to go all-in to big tech again, Amazon has come along and spoiled the party. A negative reaction to its results and a lacklustre response to Apple’s numbers would suggest the market has become more discerning.\"\n\n\"It is spending big on AI infrastructure, leading to more subdued profit guidance than expected,\" he said. \"The retail side of its business is caught up in Trump’s spiderweb of tariffs, which creates ongoing uncertainty.\"\n\n“Competition remains fierce for cloud computing services and Amazon’s sales growth rate is struggling to match rivals Microsoft and Alphabet,\" Coatsworth added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 27 August\n\nAs an enabler of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings have become a major event in the earnings calendar, with some build up to the release of its results as it tends to report later in the season.\n\nInvestor expectations have become increasingly high around Nvidia's earnings, with markets sensitive to any signs of slowdown for the chip giant.\n\nThe stock has seen a marked rebound following turbulence in the first few months of the year amid the DeepSeek AI market shock and Trump's tariff agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed curbs on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China in April. Shares popped last week after the company said that it would resume sales of its H20 chips in China. Nvidia said that the US government had assured the company that licences will be granted, with the chipmaker adding that it hoped to start deliveries soon.\n\nThe recovery in Nvidia shares since mid-April lows has meant the stock is now up 25% year-to-date and recently saw the company become the first publicly traded company to pass the $4tn market capitalisation milestone.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia beat expectations, posting revenue of $44.1bn compared with an expected $43.29bn. The chipmaker guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2% for the second quarter.\n\nGoing into the second-quarter earnings, Britzman warned that investors shouldn't expect \"any meaningful impact\" from the recent turnaround on H20 chip curbs, given the timeframe.\n\n\"However, taking a conservative view, new Chinese sales could drive a $10bn uplift in revenue by year-end, potentially more if things move fast,\" he said. \"NVIDIA may also be able to reverse some of the $4.5bn inventory write-down from the first quarter, providing a direct boost to earnings.\"\n\nHe added: \"Outside of China, overall demand remains critical. Markets have already heard from major customers that data centre expansion is a priority, which should benefit Nvidia.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T15:12:23.570593+00:00"}

AAON’s backlog reached $1.12 billion in the latest quarter and averaged 71.9% year-on-year growth over the last two years. Because this number is better than its revenue growth, we can see the company accumulated more orders than it could fulfill and deferred revenue to the future. This could imply elevated demand for AAON’s products and services but raises concerns about capacity constraints.\n\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. AAON’s annualized revenue growth of 9.6% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\n\nA company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, AAON’s 20.3% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis.\n\nBacked by two million square feet of lab testing space, AAON (NASDAQ:AAON) makes heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment for different types of buildings.\n\n\"Our second quarter results fell short of our expectations and do not reflect the high standards we set for ourselves as an organization,\" said CEO Matt Tobolski.\n\nFree Cash Flow was -$57.62 million, down from $4.85 million in the same quarter last year\n\nOperating Margin: 7.6%, down from 21.7% in the same quarter last year\n\nRevenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $335.4 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $391.2 million\n\nIs now the time to buy AAON? Find out in our full research report .\n\nHeating and cooling solutions company AAON (NASDAQ:AAON) missed Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales flat year on year at $311.6 million. Next quarter’s revenue guidance of $335.4 million underwhelmed, coming in 14.3% below analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.22 per share was 32.5% below analysts’ consensus estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAON Backlog\n\nThis quarter, AAON missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 0.6% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $311.6 million of revenue. Company management is currently guiding for a 2.5% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\n\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 19.4% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is eye-popping and implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nAAON has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for an industrials business, boasting an average operating margin of 16.1%.\n\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, AAON’s operating margin decreased by 5.2 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\n\nAAON Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nIn Q2, AAON generated an operating margin profit margin of 7.6%, down 14.1 percentage points year on year. Since AAON’s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead increased.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nRevenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nAAON’s EPS grew at a solid 11.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. However, this performance was lower than its 20.3% annualized revenue growth, telling us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\nAAON Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\nWe can take a deeper look into AAON’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, AAON’s operating margin declined by 5.2 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 4.8%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders.\n\nAAON Diluted Shares Outstanding\n\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\n\nFor AAON, its two-year annual EPS declines of 8.3% mark a reversal from its (seemingly) healthy five-year trend. We hope AAON can return to earnings growth in the future.\n\nIn Q2, AAON reported adjusted EPS at $0.22, down from $0.62 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts’ estimates, but we care more about long-term adjusted EPS growth than short-term movements. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects AAON’s full-year EPS of $1.52 to grow 58.1%.\n\nKey Takeaways from AAON’s Q2 Results\n\nWe struggled to find many positives in these results. Its revenue guidance for next quarter missed and its revenue fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 15.6% to $68 immediately following the results.\n\nAAON’s earnings report left more to be desired. Let’s look forward to see if this quarter has created an opportunity to buy the stock. What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Microsoft (MSFT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nMicrosoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.19, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 47 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.19 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 47 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and five are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.1% and 10.6% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MSFT\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MSFT\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Microsoft, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.

After years of consistent double-digit revenue increases, the momentum has faded. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues rose just 7.7% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew by only 5.7%.\n\nThis slowdown reflects cautious enterprise spending amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical pressures. Analysts anticipate that this trend will persist, with mid-to-high single-digit growth expected for fiscal 2026 and 2027.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe impact is also visible in profit forecasts. Salesforce’s EPS is now expected to witness a CAGR of 12.9% over the next five years, a big drop from the 27.8% CAGR it posted over the previous five years.\n\nThis changing growth profile shows how businesses are adjusting their IT budgets.

The merger, announced in July, was seen by many on Wall Street as a strategic move to reduce costs for CoreWeave ( CRWV ) by eliminating roughly $10bn in lease obligations. Core Scientific, which operates AI data centres across the US, leases out its computing power to these tech giants.\n\nThis will mark CoreWeave’s ( CRWV ) second earnings release since it began trading publicly on March 28, 2025. The company, which focuses on providing scalable cloud infrastructure to support and accelerate generative AI has emerged as a key player in the AI data centre market.\n\nCoreWeave, the New Jersey-based AI infrastructure firm with a market capitalisation of roughly $59bn, is set to report its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting a loss of $0.21 per share on revenues of $1.08bn. The Zacks Consensus Estimate , which has remained unchanged for the past 60 days, puts the anticipated loss at 23 cents per share, while total revenue is projected to reach $1.08bn.\n\nHere's more on what to look out for:\n\nPersimmon ( PSN.L ), one of the UK's largest housebuilders, will on Wednesday offer a telling glimpse into the state of its own business, the housing market, and the broader UK economy.\n\nAlso in the UK but with a US reach, Entain ( ENT.L ) the owner of Ladbrokes and Coral will report its interim result on Tuesday. Markets will want to hear more about the performance of its US joint venture, BetMGM.\n\nIn the UK, insurer Aviva ( AV.L ) will release its first results since acquiring Direct Line in a £6bn deal, with analysts divided on the short-term outlook.\n\nMarkets are optimistic about Cisco ( CSCO ), who is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $0.98 per share on $14.63bn in revenue. The company has consistently surpassed Wall Street estimates so we'll find out Wednesday if it's the case once again.\n\nIn the US, AI infrastructure CoreWeave ( CRWV ) will tell markets on Tuesday how its $9bn all-stock acquisition of Core Scientific is going along, following resistance from Core Scientific's shareholders due to CoreWeave’s stock price decline since the merger announcement.\n\nEarnings season is slowing down but in the coming week several key companies are still set to release earnings, giving markets some insight into their performance and future prospects.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more: UK taxpayers ‘subsidising’ S&P 500, says LSEG boss\n\nHowever, the deal has been met with resistance from some of Core Scientific’s top shareholders. According to sources familiar with the matter, a number of these investors are preparing to vote against the merger unless the terms are adjusted. The core issue lies in the fixed ratio of 0.1235 newly issued CoreWeave (CRWV) shares offered to Core Scientific (CORZ) shareholders. This arrangement does not offer any protection if CoreWeave’s stock price declines, which it has done significantly since the merger was first announced.\n\nCoreWeave’s stock has dropped by around 30% since the deal was made public on July 7, causing Core Scientific’s valuation in the acquisition to fall from approximately $20.25 per share to just over $13 per share. This sharp decline in value has left Core Scientific shareholders concerned about the fairness of the deal, with many now fearing they will be left short-changed.\n\nCisco (CSCO) – reports fiscal fourth-quarter results on Wednesday 13 August\n\nCisco, the $270bn California-based networking giant, is set to release its results amid a quietly growing wall of optimism. Deutsche Bank (DB) recently highlighted “improved visibility towards durable mid-single-digit growth in upcoming years”, noting tailwinds from AI infrastructure, enterprise deployments and sovereign spending.\n\nCisco (CSCO) develops, manufactures and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment.\n\nAccording to Koyfin consensus data, the market expects Cisco (CSCO) to report $0.98 in earnings per share (EPS) on $14.63bn in revenue, reflecting year-on-year growth of approximately 13% and 7%, respectively. The company has beaten Wall Street estimates for 11 consecutive quarters. Full-year 2025 revenue and EPS are forecasted to reach $56.62bn and $3.79, respectively, with mid-single-digit growth expected in fiscal 2026.\n\nJPMorgan analysts have maintained their overweight rating on Cisco (CSCO), with a price target of $73.00. They cited anticipated revenue growth driven by the ongoing Campus upgrade cycle and the launch of the next-generation Catalyst-2026 switch series. This new product is expected to boost revenue by increasing both the average selling price and adoption rate.\n\nAviva (AV.L) – reports half-year results on Thursday 14 August\n\nInsurer Aviva (AV.L) is set to release its first set of results since completing its takeover of Direct Line, following rival Legal & General’s (LGEN.L) earnings a week earlier. The market is eager to see how the £6bn acquisition will impact Aviva’s financials, with analysts divided on the near-term outlook.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts believe Aviva (AV.L) could exceed consensus forecasts, citing strong potential from the integration of Direct Line. However, UBS (UBS) analysts suggest investors will need to be patient, as a more detailed update on the integration won’t come until later in the year. The insurer's management has targeted £125m in cost savings from the acquisition, a goal shared prior to the deal’s completion.\n\nIn the meantime, dividends are expected to continue growing, with a yield forecast of 6.04% for 2025 and 6.48% for 2026. As of now, 10 out of 14 analysts rate the stock as a Buy or Strong Buy, reflecting optimism about the company’s future.\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\nIn Aviva's most recent full-year results, published on 27 February, operating profit rose 20% to £1.77bn, while the dividend climbed 7% to 35.7p a share. Looking ahead, the insurer is targeting £2bn of operating profit by 2026. General insurance premiums and assets under management also showed robust growth.\n\nEntain (ENT.L) – Reports interim 2025 results on Tuesday, 12 August\n\nEntain (ENT.L), the owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, has seen its shares soar more than 40% since the beginning of the year, with some analysts predicting the strong momentum could continue. A key driver behind this surge has been the impressive performance of its US joint venture, BetMGM, which has turned profitable and continues to show robust growth.\n\nIn a recent second-quarter update, Entain (ENT.L) revealed that BetMGM is expected to generate net revenue of at least $2.7bn and EBITDA of at least $150m for the year. The company has lifted its annual guidance for BetMGM, thanks to ongoing strong online growth in the US.\n\nFor 2025, Entain (ENT.L) forecasts that BetMGM’s net revenues will total at least $2.6bn, up from an earlier forecast of $2.4bn to $2.5bn. The company credited this upgrade to higher punter bets in internet gaming and online sports, noting that trading has been “broadly consistent” with the 34% jump in net revenues achieved during the first quarter.\n\nBetMGM, a joint venture between Entain and MGM Resorts, has been a growth engine for the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) bookmaker. Entain also expects BetMGM to deliver a minimum of $100m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), an improvement from prior predictions that it would just be positive.\n\nFor the wider business, analysts at Citi (C) expect modest revenue growth in both the full year and into 2026, with earnings per share forecast to rise by just over 2% in each of the next two years.\n\nPersimmon (PSN.L) – reports first-half results on Wednesday 13 August\n\nPersimmon (PSN.L), one of the UK's largest housebuilders, has seen its shares drop by more than 25% over the past year, despite broader market gains. Rising input costs, sluggish interest rate cuts, and housing affordability issues continue to weigh on the company, alongside the ongoing burden of fire safety and cladding remediation costs.\n\n“Persimmon’s shares have crumbled over the past year. They have fallen by more than a quarter, despite healthy gains from the headline indices. Input cost inflation remains an issue, as does housing affordability as interest rates come down only slowly, while the industry remains dogged by costs for fire safety and cladding remediation on historic projects. Taylor Wimpey (TW.L) has become the latest builder to set aside further provisions here,\" Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis and Dan Coatsworth, AJ Bell investment analyst, wrote.\n\nThe company has already set aside £275m for fire safety provisions, but investors are closely watching key metrics like its £1.1bn order book.\n\nLooking ahead, Persimmon has forecast between 11,000 and 11,500 completions this year, up from 10,664 in 2023. Analysts expect an operating profit of £447m, a 21% increase, largely due to a 4% rise in sales and the absence of last year’s £36m in exceptional charges.\n\nWith £259m in net cash as of December, analysts predict a small increase in Persimmon’s dividend for 2025, from 60p to 62p per share.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 11 August\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS)\n\nBarrick Mining (B)\n\nAMC (AMC)\n\nHypoport (0JVS.IL)\n\nING Group (ING)\n\nMarshalls (MSLH.L)\n\nPlus500 (PLUS.L)\n\nSalzgitter (SZG.MU)\n\nTuesday 12 August\n\nDerwent London (DLN.L)\n\nSea Limited (SEAMECLTD.NS)\n\nSpirax (SPX.L)\n\nWednesday 13 August\n\nBalfour Beatty (BBY.L)\n\nBeazley (BEZ.L)\n\nHill & Smith (HILS.L)\n\nThursday 14 August\n\nAdmiral (ADM.L)\n\nAntofagasta (ANTO.L)\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT)\n\nDeere & Co (DE)\n\nJD.com (JD)\n\nNetEase (NTES)\n\nNu (NU)\n\nFriday 15 August\n\nFlowers Foods (FLO)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:03:15.464666+00:00"}

AI closed fiscal 2025 with strong momentum, positioning its Generative AI and agentic AI platforms as central growth drivers for fiscal 2026. The company reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $108.7 million, up 26% year over year, exceeding estimates, with subscription and prioritized engineering services comprising 96% of total sales.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI revenue more than doubled in fiscal 2025, fueled by 66 initial production deployments across 16 industries, including notable wins with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dow, the U.S. Navy, and the USC Shoah Foundation. The latter’s deployment alone is expected to save more than $33 million and cut archival processing time by a decade, underscoring the tangible business and societal value of C3.ai’s solutions.\n\n\n\nThe company’s partner-driven go-to-market approach—anchored by deep alliances with Microsoft, AWS, Google Cloud, and new collaborations with PwC and McKinsey QuantumBlack—accelerates distribution and adoption. Federal contracts, such as the expanded $450 million U.S. Air Force PANDA program, add a recurring, high-credibility revenue stream.\n\n\n\nWith 95% of fiscal 2025 bookings tied to AI applications and more than 130 turnkey enterprise AI solutions deployed, C3.ai has differentiated itself from infrastructure and model providers. Management projects fiscal 2026 revenues of $447.5–$484.5 million, with free cash flow turning positive by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\n\n\nWhile macro and geopolitical uncertainties could temper near-term results, the Generative AI surge, combined with a $742.7 million cash reserve and expanding vertical reach, positions C3.ai to capture outsized gains as enterprise AI adoption accelerates.

Its aiWARE platform integrates generative AI to automate workflows, offering niche, high-value solutions. Veritone has also been targeting government and regulated industries, encroaching on areas where C3.ai seeks to expand.

But the market is now counting on the AI boom continuing.\n\nFund investors enjoyed gains. Still, the average U.S. diversified equity fund's 1.5% July advance and 4.7% year-to-date gain trails the S&P 500's 2.24% return in July and 2025 gain of 8.59%, according to Lipper Refinitiv data.\n\nStock Market Tests Highs\n\nThe S&P 500 finished with 10 new highs in July, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The rally took flight with President Donald Trump inking trade deals with Vietnam, the European Union and Japan. Better-than-expected profit reports from AI leaders Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) near month-end also breathed life into the bullish AI investment trend.\n\n\"There was a lot of big expectations going into earnings season,\" said Doug Rogers, manager of Eaton Vance Focused Growth Opportunities Fund (EIFGX). \"I think those expectations were largely met, especially on the AI side.\"\n\nBut storm clouds appeared at the end of July and early August when Trump followed through with higher tariffs on other trading partners. A weak July jobs report also gave investors pause, raising concerns about the health of the economy and reigniting a debate about Federal Reserve interest rate policy.\n\nLooking At Sector Winners\n\nFrom a sector standpoint, utility funds won big in July. They surged 4.36%. Rising demand for energy to power data centers and the AI buildout has driven utility funds to a 12.9% year-to-date gain. The other big sector winner are industrials funds. They gained 2.96% to extend their 2025 gain to 15.68%, the best year-to-date gain of all sectors. Industrials got a lift from Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" The bill included an array of tax incentives to spur U.S. manufacturing growth, as well as more expected infrastructure business related to AI.\n\n\"It's a little bit of the picks and shovels sort of argument,\" said Rogers. \"You've had HVAC companies doing very well just building out the cooling for the data centers. And you have to supply power to the data centers. So, utilities have been working well, too.\"\n\nScience and technology funds were up 2.62% in July, stretching their 2025 gain to 11.84%.\n\nAI Is A Big Stock Market Force\n\nThe AI boom continues to be a tailwind for the U.S. stock market. The large hyperscalers and megacap techs — Microsoft, Meta, Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Broadcom (AVGO) — continue to spend heavily on AI chips, AI-focused software, and other related technologies to bolster the next wave of growth, says Rogers.\n\nRogers notes that capital expenditures by the five top hyperscalers were less than $200 billion at the beginning of 2024 and estimates are for $422 billion by the end of this year. \"Those are big, big numbers,\" said Rogers.\n\nThat spending, Rogers says, feeds into the tech ecosphere and other sectors of the economy, fueling growth. \"That's a lot of revenue to be spread around a lot of different sectors,\" said Rogers. \"It's a little bit of a rising tide lifts all boats story.\"\n\nFor the market to continue to trade upward, AI must continue to be a tailwind, says Rogers.\n\n\"It's hard to see a market that works well, that doesn't include continued growth in the AI space,\" said Rogers. A big reason is the Magnificent Seven stocks now account for a huge weighting in key market benchmarks like the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000 Growth index, where the seven megatechs make up more than 50% of the index.\n\nWhat's Next For AI?\n\nRogers says there is a big catalyst coming for AI in August, most notably the Aug. 27 quarterly earnings report from AI chipmaker and $4 trillion market-cap company Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAs has been the case for some time now, big companies and growth stocks outpaced smaller stocks and value names.\n\nLarge-cap growth funds gained 2.94% in July, pushing their 2025 gain to 10.02%. In contrast, large-cap value funds rose just 0.74% last month and are up just 7.56% for the year. Small-cap growth funds rose 1.38% in July to put them up 0.2% for the year.\n\nVanguard Growth Index ETF (VUG) rallied 3.75% in July and is now up 11.06% in 2025. In contrast, Vanguard Value Index ETF (VTV), eked out a 0.16% gain last month and is up only 5.7% this year.\n\nDiversification In Stock Market\n\nDiversifying abroad was more of a mixed bag in July, although the average world equity fund's 15.03% year-to-date gain through July tops the S&P 500's 8.59% rise and the average U.S. diversified fund's 4.7% advance.\n\nLast month's foreign stock winners included China region funds. They gained 3.94% to extend their 2025 gain to 17.48%. Despite a 2.44% drop last month, European region funds still sport solid gains of 22.02% for the year. European equities have come back into favor as Germany and other European allies boost their defense spending.\n\nBond fund investors eked out gains or suffered minor losses. General domestic taxable bond funds inched 0.2% higher in July and are now up 3.91% on the year. High yield bond funds, which invest in companies with lower credit ratings and therefore typically have higher yields than investment grade bonds, rose 0.47% last month. High-yield funds are up 4.59% on the year. So-called core bond funds, which invest in a diversified basket of investment-grade bonds, dipped 0.22% in July, trimming their year-to-date gain to 3.8%.\n\nVanguard Total Bond ETF (BND) fell 0.3% in July but is still up a solid 3.73% on the year. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate (AGG) dipped 0.25% in July but is 3.75% higher on the year.\n\nBonds Regain Footing\n\nThe big news for bond investors, however, came on Aug. 1 in the form of a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, according to Thomas Urano, co-chief investment officer, managing partner at Sage Advisory Services.\n\n\"This jobs number and restatement kind of reset the way the market is thinking about the labor market,\" said Urano. It calls into question the strength of the economy and job market. And that could pave the way for Federal Reserve rate cuts. \"The rate cuts are coming,\" said Urano.\n\nA big catalyst for markets in the months ahead could be more certainty on the policy front, Rogers says. \"If there's any resolution to all the uncertainty, I think that helps drive markets higher,\" said Rogers.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nThis Popular Investment Is Doomed To 'Lost Decade,' Research Says\n\nMissed The AI Bonanza? 12 Stocks Drive The Coming Quantum Boom", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:03:32.172287+00:00"}

But Rahul Narang, a top manager, delivers benchmark-beating returns with lower risk.", "url": "https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/technology-mutual-fund-managers-secret-sauce/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo", "published_at": "2025-08-08T11:00:52Z", "source": "Investor's Business Daily", "text": "There's no such thing as a risk-free technology mutual fund.\n\nBut Rahul Narang, manager of Columbia Global Technology Growth Fund (CMTFX), has mastered the art of delivering benchmark-beating returns while taking middle-of-the-road risk.\n\n\"We're not out over our skis on the risk curve,\" said Narang, who started his investing career more than 30 years ago analyzing computer hardware companies.\n\nNarang says his views on risk were shaped during the 1999-2000 tech bubble working at a hedge fund as a short seller. Investing in value stocks at a later job broadened his skill set further. Thirteen years ago, he began managing Columbia Global Technology Growth, which he's grown from a $100 million fund to a $4 billion fund today.\n\nColumbia Global Technology Growth's winning formula? Invest in both secular growth companies and tech stocks that offer attractive value opportunities.\n\nThe fund is a 2025 IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, meaning it has topped the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2025, this top mutual fund is up 11.33% through Aug. 1, besting the S&P 500's 6.75% gain. IBD caught up with Narang to learn more about his investment philosophy and the state of tech stocks.\n\nTechnology Mutual Fund Goes For Wins\n\nIBD: What's the fund's main goal?\n\nRahul Narang: Consistently delivering strong, risk-adjusted returns over time.\n\nIBD: The fund falls dead in the middle of Morningstar's risk spectrum. Explain.\n\nNarang: Our philosophy is to build a global, diversified technology strategy, which offers a balance of secular growth opportunities and value opportunities.\n\nIBD: What do you look for in a stock?\n\nNarang: We try to own great businesses run by the best management teams regardless of market cap or geographic location. We're looking for sustainable competitive advantages, high barriers to entry, strong return on investment (ROE). We gravitate to moat-type businesses, which could come in the form of cost advantage, high switching cost, strong intellectual property, durable brand, global scale, pricing power or network effects on a durable platform. We really try to avoid businesses in secular decline.\n\nTech Fund Has Balanced Approach\n\nIBD: How did you come by this balanced approach to tech investing?\n\nNarang: In terms of portfolio construction, we've divided it into three buckets: moat-type businesses, secular growth themes and value opportunities. I spent seven years at a deep value shop. I wanted to come up with a unique technology strategy that will keep our clients in the game when there's a risk-off period.\n\nIBD: Cite examples of moat stocks the fund owns?\n\nNarang: These are names that we've owned for over a decade. That's really important. Our turnover is 7%, (which means the fund rarely sells stocks it owns). That's generated good tax-efficiency and compounding for our clients. The fund has posted compound returns of 20.5% over the past 10 years.\n\nNames include Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet (GOOGL), Broadcom (AVGO), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Booking Holdings (BKNG) and, yes, Nvidia (NVDA). We've held Nvidia for 11 years. (It's the fund's top holding with a 15.2% weighting, according to Morningstar.) It gives you a sense of the type of businesses we gravitate to and the long duration we hold these stocks.\n\nGuiding Moneymaking Factors\n\nIBD: What else is key to your investment philosophy?\n\nNarang: Identifying the correct theme and ride the curve over time. This can create tremendous shareholder value. Some of the themes we've been invested in over the years include cloud computing, cybersecurity, digital transformation, digital payments, autonomous driving, digital media and, of course, AI.\n\nIBD: Is AI a big focus of the fund?\n\nNarang: AI is now the largest theme in our strategy. We've been invested in this theme since 2016. AI names are sprinkled throughout the portfolio. And some of the emerging themes that we're doing work on currently include defense tech, quantum computing, and humanoid robots. In visual media we own (streaming service) Netflix (NFLX) and (music streaming platform) Spotify (SPOT). In cybersecurity we like CrowdStrike (CRWD). Names in digital payments would be Visa and Mastercard.\n\nKeeping Turnover Down At Tech Fund\n\nIBD: Why is your turnover so low?\n\nNarang: We tend to take a very long-term lens and realize that things usually don't go up straight to the right. There may be periods of digestion. You don't want to get shaken out of a theme based upon short-term noise.\n\nIBD: What's the final part of your investment strategy?\n\nNarang: The last bucket is value opportunities, which brings balance into the portfolio. Here's where the valuations are much cheaper and where we believe the inherent value of the business should be higher than the current stock price. Some examples include NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Samsung and Western Digital (WDC). Look at a company like Western Digital; they just reported quarterly earnings on July 30, and revenues were up 30% versus a year ago. The stock is trading around 15 times forward earnings.\n\nIBD: Why throw value stocks into a growth fund?\n\nNarang: This is part of our secret sauce. When we were constructing this approach 13 years ago, we looked at a lot of data. What we found (looking at research) is that over the last 40 years in technology investing, stocks in the most expensive and least expensive quintiles of valuation metrics tend to outperform, and names in the middle get stuck in growth purgatory.\n\nTech Fund Focused On The U.S.\n\nIBD: It's a global fund but U.S. tech stocks make up 91% of the fund. Why?\n\nNarang: What I've noticed over time is that the best business models with leading innovation are based here in the U.S.\n\nIBD: Talk about some foreign moat stocks.\n\nNarang: One of the names we own outside of the U.S. that have moat characteristics is Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). They're the largest semiconductor manufacturer tied to the AI theme. That's a top 10 position for us, and a name we've held for many years.\n\nAll the leading tech companies in the U.S., whether it's an Nvidia or an Apple (AAPL), have their chips typically manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor. They have one of the best management teams I've met. Taiwan Semiconductor won the foundry game. Taiwan Semiconductor is a classic example of a great business with a strong moat. And the valuation is also not egregious, plus they have pricing power. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it wouldn't surprise him if Taiwan Semiconductor were to raise prices because of the value that they add. They're also in the sweet spot of a big secular trend. They're right in the middle of this AI thing.\n\nOther global names include Samsung, which is more in the value camp. The stock's done well this year. It's up 30%-plus on the resurgence of orders, like the big $16.5 billion deal for Samsung to make chips for Tesla (TSLA) recently. And RELX (RELX) out of London has a really interesting AI and legal angle coming together.\n\nSafety With Moats\n\nIBD: These moat companies are the real deal, aren't they?\n\nNarang: Absolutely. When I look at AI, I divide them into pretenders versus contenders. My antenna goes off when I hear a lot of hype, and there's no real revenue. Those AI names I call pretenders. But then there's real companies that have real revenues and earnings. Obviously, Nvidia. Taiwan Semiconductor is right up there.\n\nIBD: Is the AI trade still alive?\n\nNarang: We've been invested in AI since 2016, so almost 10 years. But the inflection point, and this is really important, started to happen in late 2022 when companies finally had the computing power and data to harness more performance from these deep neural networks. And then OpenAI released ChatGPT in late November of 2022 for public use, which is (like) the iPhone moment for AI.\n\nMind The Downsides As A Tech Fund\n\nIBD: What are some risks?\n\nNarang: One needs to pay attention to the timeline of investments that companies are making around AI, as it may take time to see the ROI on these investments, or productivity improvements they were hoping for. We have seen a few 20% or so drawdowns in the AI complex over the last few years as they have proved to be excellent long-term buying opportunities. Other risks include government restrictions on chip sales to China, tariffs and geopolitics.\n\nIBD: What makes Nvidia, your top holding, a good core holding?\n\nNarang: We've held it for 11 years. If you want one AI name, Nvidia is it. They are very representative of what we call the picks and shovels of AI. Semiconductors provide the computing power for these cloud companies to harness the data that they have. That's key.\n\nPlug Into AI\n\nIBD: What other stocks are positioned to keep profiting from AI?\n\nNarang: We still feel like we're very early in AI. We saw stellar earnings results (last week) from Meta (META) and Microsoft. Meta is seeing strong performance in advertising, largely thanks to AI unlocking greater efficiency and gains across their app system. AI is improving engagement for their users. It's also improving Meta's ability to show people more relevant targeted content.\n\nMicrosoft, obviously, with their Azure cloud business. That business grew 39% in their latest fiscal quarter, and is now a $75 billion business. What's driving that? It's continued adoption in the cloud, and some AI workloads are moving into the cloud. You've got Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia. Another name that's benefiting from the AI theme is Broadcom, a name we've held for over a decade and our third-biggest holding. They do custom AI chips. One of their customers is Alphabet (GOOGL). It's been a monster of a compounder for us. They are part of the AI picks and shovels stocks. They're a huge semiconductor supplier with a great balance sheet, strong free cash flow generator. Hock Tan, the CEO, is probably one of the best CEOs in semiconductors, right up there with Nvidia's Huang.\n\nTech Fund Mines Big Earnings Gains\n\nIBD: What message does the blowout earnings from Meta and Microsoft send?\n\nNarang: We're seeing growth at scale and the moat widening for these megacap companies. That's the message.\n\nIBD: You're not worried about all the spending on AI?\n\nNarang: Let me just give you some estimates I saw this morning of the AI capital spending from the Big Five: Alphabet, Oracle (ORCL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta and Microsoft. These are just rough numbers, $350 billion plus in 2025 going to $450 billion plus in 2026. The point is these businesses have required a tremendous amount of capital, but then you're seeing Meta say, \"Oh, our revenue growth accelerated 22% from 16% in the first quarter.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says there's a very high chance the world is going to look pretty different a few years from now. So, this helps explain why we're seeing these strong capex numbers from the hyperscalers. The competitive landscape is changing so quickly, and they don't want to be left out.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, we're seeing growth and scale and moating. It's really remarkable.\n\nIs $4 Trillion The Limit?\n\nIBD: What do you say to investors who say, \"Nvidia and Microsoft are $4 trillion companies. How high can they go?\"\n\nNarang: It's funny, I got asked that question the day they hit $1 trillion, $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion. It's a fair question. We try to step back and look at the total addressable market: is it expanding? Are the companies seeing a return on their investment (ROI)?\n\nIBD: It's about sales and earnings, right?\n\nNarang: I remember 1999 when tech stocks were trading at 100, 200, 300 times earnings. They were trading on price to eyeballs. But this go around, these companies are generating real cash flows, real earnings, real scale, and they're not trading at crazy valuations. As long as the earnings come through, growth will continue to accelerate.\n\nIBD: To make money, do investors have to invest in these big trends like AI?\n\nNarang: One of the mistakes people make is that they identify a big trend correctly. But then when there's a little bit of noise, they get scared out (of the market). And then they miss that long-term (compounding) over time.\n\nTech Fund Taps Into The Legal Market\n\nIBD: Why are you bullish on RELX?\n\nNarang: We bought RELX a year or two ago. So, it's a newer name. They own an asset called LexisNexis, a legal database that law firms use. They are starting to bring AI capabilities into some of their legal products. It's a steady grower with good valuation support. We just saw this as an interesting asset tied to legal AI, and they have a real moat around their business, because their product, LexisNexis, is highly regarded in the legal field.\n\nIBD: What non-megacap companies are in the fund?\n\nNarang: Robinhood (HOOD), the financial services platform that's now valued at nearly $90 billion. They reported second-quarter earnings July 30 (and revenue jumped 45%, driven by crypto.) The stock was up 125%. It's a name we added this year.\n\nIBD: What do you like about Robinhood?\n\nNarang: Growth is accelerating. We really like their focus on the younger demographic. The pace of innovation at the company has been spectacular. Their strong position in crypto trading, along with product innovation, were two of the main reasons we started a position. (Another plus) is we just saw a sea change in the regulatory environment with the new Trump administration.\n\nAre We In A Tech Bubble?\n\nIBD: There's been talk of a bubble. Is the stock market frothy?\n\nNarang: In the bubble years of 1999-2000, Cisco was trading at 100 plus times earnings. Now Cisco trades at 16, 17 times earnings. Meta is trading around 27 times. The valuations are nowhere close to the 1999 bubble valuations. The other big difference is now the free cash flow characteristics of these tech companies are so much stronger than in prior years. Through the first quarter, tech free cash flow margins were 22%. That's three times the rest of the market. That points to the quality of the business.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:03:34.126811+00:00"}

The integration follows a pilot program in which more than 2,000 city employees used the technology and reported productivity gains.\n\nThe city updated its generative AI guidelines ahead of the rollout, making staff accountable for any materials they use or share and incorporating the city's transparency ordinance to provide “full visibility” into the city’s use of AI.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nState and local government use of AI has roughly tripled since 2020, from 13% to 45%, according to a survey of government IT leaders. Questions surrounding cybersecurity and clear guidelines for the technology have lingered, however.\n\nA survey of IT leaders in late 2024 found that 38% believed their local government was “not prepared at all” to use AI. And while some localities have quickly embraced the technology, others have approached it with “the utmost caution,” a 2024 ICMA report found.\n\nAI developers are looking to alleviate public-sector concerns.

Now that two competitors have broken the $4 trillion threshold, the question shifts to which company will reach $5 trillion first.\n\nClimbing from $4 trillion to $5 trillion is much easier than going from $3 trillion to $4 trillion, as it only requires a 25% rise versus a 33% rise. As a result, these companies are going to continue breaking these market cap barriers more quickly, but when can we expect these two to hit that mark?\n\nMicrosoft and Nvidia are succeeding thanks to a few shared tailwinds\n\nMicrosoft has become one of the most prominent tech giants, and offers a wide variety of products ranging from business software to cloud computing to gaming devices. However, the show's focus is clearly on its Intelligent Cloud division, led by Azure, its cloud computing service.\n\nAzure is seeing massive growth as Microsoft has become the top platform for building cloud workloads. Cloud computing can run traditional business workloads like data processing, information storage, or website hosting, but it's also useful for running AI workloads. The dual tailwind that cloud computing is receiving is impressive and will likely be around for many more years.\n\nWhen a company like Microsoft builds new cloud servers to meet demand, they're often filled with computing hardware from Nvidia. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class and are extremely flexible for running various workloads. This flexibility makes them ideal for data centers, as the same computing units can run various workloads when needed.\n\nNvidia has GPUs for multiple use cases, but its biggest by far is data centers. Thanks to the same tailwinds that are increasing demand for cloud computing and AI, Nvidia expects data center capital expenditures to rise from $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028. This bodes well for Nvidia's growth story and shows that it can continue rising at its rapid pace.\n\nBoth Nvidia and Microsoft have solid growth stories, but what do the numbers say?\n\nMicrosoft appears to produce more profits than Nvidia\n\nIf you look at how much income each company is generating, it's clear that Microsoft has a head start over Nvidia.\n\nHowever, a few factors are holding Nvidia back. First, Q1 had poor net income numbers because the U.S. revoked its export license to China. Nvidia has reapplied for that license with assurances that it will be approved. Still, the lost sales of Nvidia's H20 chips will harm its net income figures in both Q1 and Q2. Second, Nvidia hasn't reported Q2 results yet (it's due to report them later this month), so Microsoft has a bit of a head start that way.\n\nLast, and likely the most important, Nvidia is growing much faster than Microsoft. In Q4 of fiscal 2025 (ending June 30), Microsoft's net income rose 24%. Considering Microsoft's size and maturity, that's impressive growth, and investors shouldn't have any qualms with the results Microsoft delivered. However, Nvidia's net income increased by 26% in Q1 fiscal year 2025 (ending April 27), despite being severely hampered by a write-off of H20 chips.\n\nWith Nvidia expected to grow earnings faster than Microsoft, it has a slight premium to Microsoft.\n\nThis premium is why Nvidia is worth more than Microsoft despite having a smaller net income.\n\nBecause of Nvidia's faster growth rate and premium valuation, I think it will likely beat Microsoft to the $5 trillion mark. While Microsoft's growth is impressive, it's still slower than Nvidia's, despite Nvidia's results being hampered. I think both stocks are excellent companies to own at these points, but Nvidia still has the edge.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:03:38.392371+00:00"}

But Microsoft's long and impressive dividend track record doesn't automatically make it the better dividend stock when comparing the two.\n\nOn the surface, software giant Microsoft's dividend yield of about 0.6% comfortably exceeds social media specialist Meta's yield of roughly 0.3%. But beneath this headline dividend metric, the comparison isn't so straightforward. Ultimately, though, one of the two stocks does come out ahead when comparing them as dividend stocks. So, which is it?\n\nMicrosoft: a reliable dividend growth stock\n\nHighlighting Microsoft's track record of dividend growth, its quarterly payout of $0.83 per share, or $3.32 annually, represents a 10% boost over its dividend last year. Furthermore, the dividend marks the company's 20th consecutive year of increases.\n\nDespite Microsoft's modest dividend yield of just 0.6%, the company's payout is backed by one of the most durable business models in tech. In addition, the dividend is easy for the company to pay out. It taps into only 24% of the company's annual earnings and a third of its annual free cash flow.\n\nLooking ahead, Microsoft should be able to not only sustain but also grow this payout. Recent business performance shows a healthy, fast-growing company. In fiscal 2025, which ended June 30, Microsoft generated $281.7 billion in revenue, up 15% year over year. Operating income rose 17% to $128.5 billion. On the heels of such strong performance, the software company returned over $37 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.\n\nMeta: early days with upside potential\n\nMeta Platforms' dividend is still new to Wall Street. Introduced last year, the company, which is the parent of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, has already increased the payout once. In February, the company said it would boost its dividend by 5% to 52 and a half cents per share, translating to $2.10 annually.\n\nAlthough the company's dividend yield of 0.3% and recent dividend increase are small, investors shouldn't count Meta out as a dividend stock. After all, its dividend consumes only about 7% of earnings and roughly 10% of free cash flow -- extremely conservative metrics. Further, the company's recent business momentum is extraordinary. Meta's second-quarter revenue soared 22% year over year, and its earnings per share jumped 38%. This business strength was helped by 6% year-over-year growth in daily active users across its family of social media apps, an 11% year-over-year increase in ad impressions, and a 9% jump in price per ad.\n\nAs with Microsoft, Meta is returning cash in more ways than one. Indeed, this explains why it has been so modest with its dividend; management favors share repurchases by a wide margin. In its most recent quarter, management repurchased nearly $10 billion worth of its stock while paying out just $1.33 billion in dividends.\n\nAll that said, Meta's entire business model is comparatively new and potentially riskier. The company's reality labs segment continues to burn cash as Meta invests heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). Highlighting how Meta's business is showing signs of potentially becoming more capital-intensive over time, the company's capital expenditures this year are expected to be between $66 and $72 billion. This means capital expenditures will rise about 77% year over year.\n\nOf course, there's massive upside potential to the dividend, and the company's share repurchase program, if Meta's aggressive investments today help the company keep growing rapidly for years to come.\n\nThere's a clear winner\n\nSo, which tech giant is the better dividend stock? Microsoft is arguably the clear winner today. But that could change in the future.\n\n\n\nMaking the case for Microsoft, its yield is higher, its dividend is more established, and a long track record of consistent growth and strong free cash flow generation supports the payout. Investors can count on Microsoft to keep raising its dividend year after year, even as it continues to invest heavily in AI and cloud computing.\n\nMeta, on the other hand, is still a newcomer. Its dividend may grow substantially over time, but there's no proven history yet. And while management's capital allocation has been increasingly shareholder-friendly, the company's rapidly rising capital expenditures and still-nascent dividend policy make it a riskier choice for income-focused investors. Sure, the stock trades at a more conservative valuation of 28 times earnings, compared with Microsoft at about 39 times earnings. But this lower valuation makes sense given Meta's dependence on advertising, a much more volatile and unpredictable source of revenue than Microsoft's diversified business.\n\nLong term, Meta could very well become the better dividend stock of the two. But the safer bet today is Microsoft. For investors seeking dividend dependability with upside, the software giant is the more compelling choice.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:03:40.359774+00:00"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nLAS VEGAS — The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has continued its work to protect federal networks and support critical infrastructure providers despite massive job cuts and resource constraints, two senior CISA officials said during the Black Hat USA cybersecurity conference here Thursday.\n\n“We are not retreating, we’re advancing in a new direction,” CISA CIO Robert Costello said during a panel discussion.\n\nChris Butera, the acting head of CISA’s Cybersecurity Division, added that, while the agency “did lose people” to the Trump administration’s downsizing program — roughly a third of its employees — CISA still has “a very talented workforce.” He cited the agency’s around-the-clock response to major vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint as an example of CISA’s continued capacity.\n\nButera and Costello were the only CISA officials speaking at Black Hat this year, a dramatic departure from the agency’s past representation at the annual event and a stark reminder of the Trump administration’s crackdown on government travel and conference participation. CISA’s diminished presence at industry events over the past six months has alarmed some cyber experts who worry that the new administration is undermining CISA’s years-long effort to strengthen relationships with its partners in private industry and the security community.\n\nThe two CISA officials used Thursday’s panel to push back on that narrative, arguing that their agency remained committed to supporting critical infrastructure providers and state and local governments with free cybersecurity services and guidance.\n\nIn the next few months, Costello said, CISA will release new tools that make it easier for critical infrastructure organizations to sign up for the agency’s Cyber Hygiene service. More than 11,000 partners rely on this free offering, which scans internet-facing systems for vulnerabilities. Costello said CISA has automated additional aspects of the service so that partners will soon be able to log into a portal, track the progress of the scans and easily see their findings.\n\n“You can actually work with us through that to see how you're doing, track your progress, [and] engage with our cybersecurity advisers in a method [that’s] not over an email,” he said.\n\nCISA will also launch a new “industry engagement portal” before the end of the year to make it easier for private companies to get access to the agency, Costello said.\n\nAmid concerns about the effects of CISA cutting contracts for staff and services, both officials said they were intently focused on giving agency employees the tools they needed to succeed.\n\n“We’re releasing a lot of new capabilities almost every week to enable the cyber operators to operate better,” Costello said. “We are very, very hard at work.”\n\nButera said AI could help defenders at CISA and elsewhere rapidly analyze vast quantities of information and reduce “the asymmetric advantage that the attacker has.”\n\nContinued funding for CVE program\n\nThe officials also discussed several other important aspects of CISA’s mission.\n\nFollowing months of confusion about the status of the government’s commitment to MITRE’s CVE program, Butera said CISA was “heavily invested” in it and would “continue to fund” and improve it. “That program is super foundational to our agency,” he said, calling it “the basis and foundation for the whole vulnerability and cybersecurity ecosystem.”\n\nButera also provided an update on CISA’s use of administrative subpoenas, which allow it to compel internet service providers to provide identifying information about organizations that the agency finds to be using vulnerable technology through its internet scans. Since Congress authorized the service at the beginning of 2021, Butera said, CISA has used it to identify and contact more than 3,000 organizations to warn them that their systems are vulnerable. In 80% of those cases, CISA has convinced the organization to shield vulnerable systems from the internet.\n\nCostello also shared a progress report on CISA’s IT modernization efforts, revealing that by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, the agency will be “completely done with our on-premises environments and migrated to the cloud.”\n\nRead more news from Black Hat USA 2025 here.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:03:42.178536+00:00"}

Discover SCENE\n\nOpenAI unveiled GPT-5 during a Thursday livestream, marking what the company called a qualitative shift in artificial intelligence capability after several months of anticipation and multiple delays. The model is being rolled out to all ChatGPT users throughout the day today.\n\nThe release represents OpenAI's attempt to unify its various AI technologies into a single system. The company described reasoning as central to its artificial general intelligence strategy, with the breakthrough eliminating previous trade-offs between speed and analytical depth. Users no longer need to choose between fast responses and deep reasoning capabilities—GPT-5 delivers both simultaneously.\n\nHere’s a cheatsheet on what you need to know.\n\n1. When can I get it?\n\nGPT-5 rolls out today on ChatGPT and via its API. Microsoft has also incorporated GPT-5 into its products immediately, making it available through Copilot and GitHub Copilot.\n\nIf you updated your Edge browser with Copilot, you should be ready to use it now.\n\n2. Does everyone get the same version?\n\nYes, sort of: Free tier users will start with the standard GPT-5 before transitioning to a lighter \"GPT-5 mini\" version when they deplete their usage quota. Pro subscribers ($200 a month) get unlimited access to the full model while Plus subscribers ($20/month) get access to standard GPT-5.\n\nPro subscribers can run GPT-5 at its highest intelligence level with additional features like early access to its advanced agents, unlimited usage, more capabilities for deep research, priority access, and advanced voice mode with higher limits for video and screen sharing.\n\n3. What does multimodal mean? Does a separate image generator go away?\n\nMultimodal means GPT-5 can process and generate different types of content—text, images, voice, and now even video—all within the same conversation. The model showed enhanced foreign language understanding for complex tasks, generating complete websites with French words and proper pronunciation.\n\nInstead of juggling between Vision, Sora, GPT, and the “o” models to reason, GPT-5 can do everything on its own.\n\n4. How big is the context window and why does it matter?\n\nGPT-5 has a 256,000 token context window for input, with the API accepting up to 272,000 input tokens and emitting a maximum of 128,000 reasoning and output tokens, for a total context length of 400,000 tokens.\n\nThis means it can process roughly 200,000 words at once—equivalent to a long novel. The larger context window allows GPT-5 to maintain coherent conversations over much longer interactions and analyze entire codebases or lengthy documents without losing track of important details.\n\nThat said, this window is not very big by today’s standards. Just for context, Gemini 2.5 is capable of handling 1 million tokens,\n\n5. What new features does it have?\n\nNone, really, but some of its skills are upgraded to such a degree that they will feel like new features.\n\n6. So what’s so great about it?\n\nGPT-5 is more powerful in just about every way. For instance, it demonstrated remarkable coding capabilities during the presentation, writing over 400 lines of code in two minutes when prompted to create a Bernoulli effect simulation from scratch. Other cool things shown off in the demo:\n\nVoice interactions sound less robotic and live video capabilities were introduced that match competitors like Gemini Live.\n\nThe model can now analyze uploaded images and incorporate them into its responses.\n\nIt’s better at agentic tasks and is supposedly able to handle real-world applications and explain its reasoning.\n\nNext week users will be able to integrate Gmail and Google calendar, which will allow it to be a much better assistant.\n\n7. Has pricing changed?\n\nChatGPT subscription pricing remains unchanged at $20/month for Plus and $200/month for Pro.\n\nFor API users, GPT-5 costs $1.25 per million input tokens and $10.00 per million output tokens for the standard model. GPT-5 mini costs $0.25 per million input tokens and $2.00 per million output tokens, while GPT-5 nano runs $0.05 for input and $0.40 for output.\n\nThis would make the model competitive against offerings from other companies and even cheaper than other models from OpenAI like GPT-4.1 or OpenAI o1 pro which costs a whopping $600 per million tokens.\n\n8. Are we at AGI yet?\n\nNo. However, the company positioned reasoning as \"at the heart of our AGI program.\"\n\nThe model represents significant progress but remains focused on specific tasks rather than matching human intelligence across all domains. For instance, GPT-5 is great at language tasks but lacks the general intelligence required to perform a wide range of activities independently. It’s not yet self-teaching or self-adapting.\n\n9. Can GPT-5 generate videos?\n\nNot yet. While video generation wasn't included in the initial release, OpenAI has Sora for video creation as a separate product.\n\nCEO Sam Altman previously indicated that future versions would support video “eventually.”\n\nThe current version does understand live video, however, so it could watch you try to fix a bike and provide live instructions.\n\n10. How reliable is it compared to previous models?\n\nOpenAI reported that GPT-5 is \"significantly less deceptive\" than previous models, addressing one of the most persistent challenges in large language model deployment.\n\nOn factual accuracy benchmarks, GPT-5 makes approximately 80% fewer factual errors than o3, making it substantially more trustworthy for enterprise applications according to Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s chief scientist.\n\n11. What about memory and personalization?\n\nGPT-5 supposedly will offer better persistent memory across sessions, remembering facts, preferences, and instructions across multiple conversations, even if you close the app and open a new tab days later. GPT-4’s memory was limited, especially days after a session paused.\n\nThe company said you can now set long-term objectives (e.g. help me lose 10 pounds in a healthy way, or help me prepare for my physics test), and GPT-5 will adapt its responses accordingly to proactively align with your goals.\n\n12. How private is my personal data?\n\nAltman previously acknowledged that OpenAI might have to hand over a user’s personal data to the government if legally required to do so.\n\n13. Do I need to switch between different models anymore?\n\nNot anymore—unless you want to generate video via Sora. With GPT-5's launch, OpenAI expressed confidence in deprecating all previous models.\n\nThe company designed GPT-5 to handle all use cases that previously required specialized models, though users can still choose between GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, and GPT-5 nano based on speed and cost requirements.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:03:47.855687+00:00"}

The commentary from the industry leader, coupled with multiple analyst downgrades, fueled fears of a broader slowdown in the cybersecurity sector. This led to a ripple effect, dragging down shares of other cybersecurity companies as investors re-evaluate the industry's near-term growth prospects.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nCrowdStrike’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 3.6% on the news that the White House announced a new round of steep global tariffs, sparking concerns of a trade war and its impact on the U.S. and global economies. This move creates significant uncertainty for businesses and investors. The new tariffs, with rates of up to 41% on imports from 68 countries and the European Union, prompted a broad market sell-off, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index showing notable weakness. Adding to the bearish sentiment was a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which revealed that employers created only 73,000 jobs, far below economists' expectations. This combination of trade fears and signs of a slowing labor market has created a \"risk-off\" environment, leading investors to pull back from growth-oriented sectors like software and technology.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 23.1% since the beginning of the year, but at $427.90 per share, it is still trading 16.8% below its 52-week high of $514.10 from July 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,203.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

With AI momentum accelerating and strong guidance, MSFT presents a buy opportunity in 2025.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/msft-q4-earnings-beat-cloud-163200423.html", "published_at": "2025-08-07T16:32:00Z", "source": "Zacks", "text": "Looking ahead, Microsoft's guidance suggests continued strength. The company projected fiscal first-quarter 2026 revenues between $74.7 billion and $75.8 billion. More importantly, Azure revenues are expected to grow approximately 37% at constant currency (cc) in the upcoming quarter, indicating sustained momentum despite the massive scale already achieved. The Zacks consensus estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $75.38 billion, indicating 14.93% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $3.64 per share, indicating an increase of 10.3% from the year-ago period.\n\nThe standout performer was Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, which achieved remarkable growth of 39% year over year. For the first time, Microsoft disclosed Azure's standalone annual revenues, revealing it surpassed $75 billion for fiscal 2025, representing 34% growth driven by broad-based demand across all workloads. This disclosure provides crucial transparency for investors and demonstrates Azure's substantial scale in competing with Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services, Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform and Oracle ORCL Cloud. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which houses Azure and server products, generated $29.88 billion in revenues, rising 26% and beating consensus estimates of $28.92 billion. The company has transformed every Azure region into an AI-first environment with liquid cooling capabilities, positioning itself at the forefront of the artificial intelligence infrastructure wave. Management revealed that Microsoft added more than two gigawatts of new datacenter capacity over the past 12 months alone, now operating over 400 datacenters across 70 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider. The AI momentum extends beyond infrastructure, with Microsoft's Copilot products achieving significant traction. The company reported that its AI assistants, including Microsoft 365 Copilot for commercial customers and the consumer Copilot in Windows, have reached 100 million monthly active users. This rapid adoption demonstrates Microsoft's ability to monetize AI investments through practical applications that enhance productivity across its ecosystem. The integration of AI capabilities across Microsoft's product portfolio is driving higher revenue per user for Microsoft 365 commercial cloud products, creating a powerful growth catalyst.\n\nMicrosoft MSFT delivered exceptional fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate across all key metrics, demonstrating the company's dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and artificial intelligence markets. The technology giant reported revenues of $76.44 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7%, while earnings per share reached $3.65, beating the consensus mark by 8.96%. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nCloud Market Dynamics and Competitive Position\n\nThe global cloud computing market presents enormous growth opportunities, with the market expected to reach $912.77 billion in 2025 and projected to witness a CAGR exceeding 21% through 2034. Within this expanding market, Microsoft has steadily gained ground against competitors. While Amazon Web Services maintains the largest share at approximately 31%, Microsoft Azure has captured between 20% and 24% of the market, showing consistent share gains quarter after quarter throughout fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft's competitive advantages extend beyond raw market share statistics. The company benefits from deep enterprise relationships and seamless integration with its Office productivity suite, Windows operating system, and enterprise software solutions. This ecosystem approach creates significant switching costs and drives adoption of Azure services among existing Microsoft customers. Furthermore, Microsoft's early and aggressive investments in AI, particularly through its partnership with OpenAI, have positioned Azure as the preferred platform for AI workloads, attracting both startups and enterprises seeking to leverage cutting-edge AI capabilities.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has outperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector in the past six months. While shares of Oracle and Google have returned 42.2% and 5.6%, respectively, Amazon has lost 3.9% in the same time frame. Microsoft's solid 27.5% six-month performance demonstrates superior execution.\n\nMSFT Outperforms Sector YTD\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite facing competition from AWS, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud, Microsoft's differentiated approach focusing on hybrid cloud solutions and enterprise integration continues to resonate with customers. The company's ability to deliver consistent growth while operating at such a massive scale demonstrates the sustainability of its competitive advantages and the effectiveness of its strategic investments.\n\nValuation Considerations\n\nMicrosoft currently trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 12.1x, representing a premium to the Zacks Computer-Software industry average of 8.86 times. While this elevated valuation might typically signal caution, several factors justify the premium. The company's accelerating Azure growth, expanding margins, and leadership position in the AI revolution support higher multiples. Microsoft's operating margin expanded to 44.9% in the fiscal fourth quarter, demonstrating improved efficiency even while investing heavily in AI infrastructure.\n\nMSFT’s P/S F12M Ratio\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Outlook for 2025\n\nThe premium valuation reflects investor confidence in Microsoft's ability to sustain above-market growth rates and capture an outsized share of the cloud and AI opportunity. With Azure showing acceleration rather than deceleration at its current scale, and AI monetization still in early stages, Microsoft appears well-positioned to grow into and potentially exceed its current valuation multiples. For growth-oriented investors seeking exposure to secular technology trends, Microsoft presents an attractive entry point despite the premium valuation, particularly given its proven execution track record and multiple growth drivers extending well into the future.

That will help them avoid heavy losses in a game in which the winners take all and the playing field is tilted heavily toward those with the biggest budgets.\n\nAccording to data from Bloomberg, four of the world’s largest tech firms – Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta – are expected to funnel more than $344 billion into capital expenditures this year, much of which will go toward data centers that feed their lofty AI ambitions.\n\nThey aren’t alone:\n\nAccording to data from Pitchbook, reported by CNBC in late July, AI startups raised more than $104 billion in the first half of 2025, nearly matching the total amount invested in AI startups in 2024. Around two-thirds of all venture funding during that period went to AI.\n\nAnd investors are devising their own AI infrastructure strategies, too. On Wednesday, Apollo Global Management agreed to acquire a majority stake in Stream Data Centers, and Brookfield Asset Management announced a strategy dedicated to developing AI infrastructure, aiming to capitalize on a “significant pipeline of opportunities.”\n\nThe firms are all vying for a piece of a market that’s estimated to be worth multiple trillions, said Brian Sathianathan, CTO and co-founder of Iterate.ai. Some are already starting to see the payoff. Industry darling Nvidia has been able to “sell and move servers with all the data center buildouts,” he said, and the three biggest cloud providers – Google, Amazon and Microsoft – are seeing significant growth. “It’s already working,” he said.\n\nThose that manage to win have a shot at massive returns. “This market’s got the potential to do that,” Sathianathan said. But with all the cash flowing into developments, some companies may be digging themselves into a hole that they’re not able to get out of, he said.\n\n“This is a winner takes all,” said Sathianathan. “If 20 players are vying for a spot that five can fill, then 15 are going to fail. That’s just the nature of free markets.”\n\nSo where does this leave the average enterprise? The best place to start is determining what “core competencies” your business has and how AI fits into them, Sathianathan said.\n\nWhen choosing an AI vendor, he added, it’s best not to put all your eggs in one basket. “I would warn enterprises from fully betting on one Big Tech firm,” he said. Doing so could create a “lock-in” that ends up making it more difficult to switch if better options present themselves. “Bet on a few, and also bet on startups,” he recommended.\n\n“Big companies have invested so much in this,” Sathianathan said. “They’re going to try and put you into a place where you are stuck with their software or their infrastructure.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:04:02.079575+00:00"}

But when it comes to long-term value, growth potential and financial stability, how do they really compare?\n\nDiscover More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\n\nFor You: How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting out, understanding key metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio can help you make smarter decisions. This ratio, which compares a company’s stock price to its earnings per share, offers insight into how the market values a company’s profitability.\n\nTo better understand the strengths and weaknesses of each company, GOBankingRates reached out to stock experts for their insights. Here’s what to consider before adding either stock to your portfolio.\n\nThe Case for Tesla\n\nStock price: $308.95\n\nMarket cap: $997.5 billion\n\n52-week high: $488.54\n\n52-week low: $191.48\n\nP/E ratio: 178.34\n\nTesla’s stock is currently trading at a P/E ratio of over 178, which is extremely high, according to Scott Ritchie, an investing expert at Stoculator.\n\nTesla is a unique company because it straddles two worlds: automotive and tech. As a tech company, Tesla is heavily invested in artificial intelligence and robotics, but Ritchie has a warning for investors. “It is still too soon to bet on it at this valuation,” he said, “especially since most of Tesla’s developments are focused on autonomous driving, which still faces a lot of challenges including regulatory ones that could delay it for at least a couple of years.”\n\nCompared to other tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon, Tesla still has a higher P/E ratio, but this may be more due to its leadership as a car company.\n\nAs a car manufacturer, Tesla’s market cap of nearly $1 trillion dwarfs that of legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors. However, recent performance has raised concerns. In Q2 2025, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries dropped 13.5%, falling to 384,122 units compared to 443,956 in the same period last year. This decline has impacted earnings and shaken investor confidence in some markets.\n\nAdditionally, according to David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX, an automated trading platform, “[Tesla hasn’t] yet proved that they can dominate the EV market. They don’t have as much money in the bank, and it’s still quite a young company.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:04:08.570027+00:00"}

As of this writing, the stock is down about 8% since the report in late July. The main reason for the stock's severe decline is likely the company's lower than anticipated growth in its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The market may be worried that much faster growth at Microsoft (MSFT 0.80%) and Alphabet's (GOOGL -0.17%) cloud businesses is a sign that the important Amazon service is losing its edge in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, investors may have some concerns about Amazon's guidance for third-quarter profitability.\n\nBut has the market overreacted? I believe so. Yes, AWS's slowing growth is something investors should keep an eye on. But the stock's pullback has arguably more than compensated for the increased risks associated with this part of Amazon's sprawling business.\n\nWhat spooked investors\n\nOn the surface of Amazon's second-quarter results, the company crushed it. The e-commerce and cloud-computing juggernaut reported revenue of $167.7 billion, up 13% year over year. Earnings per share grew even faster, climbing 33% to $1.68. The consensus analyst forecast called for revenue and earnings per share of just $162.1 billion and $1.33, respectively.\n\nMaking the report look even better, the company guided for another quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Q3. Specifically, management said it expected revenue for the period to be between $174.0 billion and $179.5 billion, translating to 10% to 13% year-over-year growth.\n\nStill, the company may have missed the mark in the report in two areas.\n\nFirst, AWS revenue grew about 18% year over year. That's a meager growth rate compared with the 39% and 32% year-over-year revenue growth seen at Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, respectively. These two competitors' revenue in their cloud businesses was significantly higher than analysts' average forecasts for the important units, while Amazon's barely beat forecasts. Investors may be concerned that Amazon's lower growth indicates the company isn't effectively capitalizing on cloud-computing opportunities in the rapidly expanding AI services market.\n\nAnother potential reason for investor skittishness is Amazon's guidance for third-quarter operating income to be between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion. The midpoint of this guidance range is $18 billion, representing only 3% year-over-year growth.\n\nA buying opportunity\n\nBut here's where things turn optimistic for investors. Sure, shares have taken a painful hit. But with the stock down more than 9%, the market has arguably overreacted to Amazon's more modest cloud growth compared to its competitors, and to management's muted expectations for third-quarter profitability.\n\nZooming out, this is still a business growing its sales at double-digit rates. In addition, its business is supported by both a robust e-commerce business and a cloud business, which has just nearly 18% year-over-year top-line growth -- slightly faster than the segment's growth rate in the prior quarter. Sure, it may not be as fast as Azure's and Google Cloud's growth. But it's still a very strong rate.\n\nWith the stock now trading at just 33 times earnings, this is a rare opportunity for investors to buy into one of the United States' best companies at a reasonable valuation. Sure, there's no telling where the bottom is. Shares could get cheaper. Additionally, the risks of Amazon losing its edge as AI becomes more central to cloud computing are real. Investors, therefore, will have to continue keeping tabs on how AWS performs in the coming quarters. Ultimately, however, risks seem largely priced in. The long-term investment outcome from this price will likely be respectable.\n\nSo should investors buy the dip in Amazon stock? I think so.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:04:15.190989+00:00"}

Throughout the software landscape, we have seen the AI transition process with differing results for the different companies. To help us navigate it, I'm joined by Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler Equity Research Analyst. Brent, it's good to see you. You know, we've been having this discussion over the past couple of years about AI sort of making its way through software, both as a disruptor, but also as something additional that they can sell.

Yeah, it's, uh, it's been an interesting earnings season. We've seen a lot of volatility in software, and, uh, some good, some bad. And, and as we think about the process, the journey we are in, it really is being dominated today, the AI discussion, by AI infrastructure. It's the Microsofts of the world, the Oracles of the world. Um, uh, these are the companies, the big platforms that are, uh, standing up the infrastructure to, uh, to drive inference, uh, as folks, uh, start to offload some of these workloads, uh, to the machines, if you will. Uh, and that's where we've seen most of the upside. Um, as you think about new model releases, obviously, there's a big one last week with, uh, GPT 5, uh, from, uh, from OpenAI, Chat GPT, the new version there. Uh, a lot of volatility in these software names, uh, with the launch of that sense. I think you're seeing a continuation of that, uh, with monday today, some volatility around that. So, in the interim, at least at the app layer, I would say there's a, a lot of hyper sensitivity, uh, to any sort of kind of blemish, even if it has nothing to do with AI. Um, there's nervousness of, of, of does AI drive a disruption to the app layer? Uh, at the infrastructure layer, still lots of optimism, accelerating growth, lots of, uh, positive things happening in AI infrastructure. So, I kind of really see, uh, a split, kind of a, a two-part split here on the AI discussion, infrastructure, and then apps.\n\n04:16 Speaker A\n\nWell, and there are some, uh, software companies that are at the infrastructure layer, right? Like I think of a Microsoft or an Oracle, for example, as being more in that category. So, how are you thinking about that, which are in which, and where investors should, therefore, be looking?\n\n04:52 Brent Bracelin\n\nSo, if we look at prior tech cycles, often times the spend on infrastructure happens first, and then over time, uh, we see either a new wave of applications created, or existing incumbents leverage some of these new technologies, and roll out new products. It just takes time. I think it's very different. Enterprise spend is very different than, um, consumer. Uh, and so, uh, it's just, just going to take time is the, uh, the short answer. Um, infrastructure is happening. Apps is just going to take time before we see it show up. And so, it's kind of a, a tale of two cities today, if you will. Um, but, um, it is, uh, obviously something we're paying very close attention to.

Plenty of other companies are using AI to great effect, but they don't get the same level of attention.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM -2.60%) is killing it in AI, and it's a real shame many investors haven't caught on. IBM's AI strategy is focused on providing solutions to its enterprise clients. The company isn't plowing mountains of capital into AI data centers, and it isn't splurging on training industry-leading models. Instead, through a mix of consulting services, software, and hardware, IBM is emerging as a leader in enterprise AI.\n\n$7.5 billion and counting\n\nSince IBM kicked off its generative AI strategy, the company has booked more than $7.5 billion worth of business. Around 80% of this total comes from the consulting business, with the rest coming from software. Playing a supporting role is hardware, namely IBM's decades-old mainframe business.\n\nIBM's consulting-forward strategy works because enterprise clients need more than software. IBM's watsonx platform provides the software tools necessary for clients to develop, fine-tune, deploy, and govern AI agents and applications, but implementation services and other offerings from the consulting business are equally important. A client who uses AWS and Azure for cloud computing may want to deploy watsonx on those platforms, for example, requiring a complex solution that IBM can provide.\n\nIBM does train its own AI models, but the focus is on speed, safety, and cost. IBM's Granite family of models are designed to be fine-tunable for specific tasks. They're open source, perform well in safety benchmarks, and are cost-effective for businesses. In terms of performance, Granite beats competing AI models of similar complexity in a variety of benchmarks.\n\nIBM's mainframe business shouldn't be ignored. Major industries including financial services still depend heavily on IBM's mainframe systems, and the latest z17 model brings some serious AI firepower. The z17 is designed for more than 250 distinct AI use cases, ranging from loan risk mitigation to medical image analysis, and it can handle 450 billion AI inferencing operations per day with response times of one millisecond. For enterprises needing real-time AI inferencing and rock-solid reliability, IBM's mainframes continue to be the best option.\n\nImportantly, IBM's AI strategy doesn't depend on AI technology making exponential gains in capabilities, or on ever-increasing AI infrastructure investments. Because IBM is focusing on delivering AI solutions that help companies reduce costs or boost efficiency, demand should hold up even if the AI frenzy cools off. As it stands today, AI is incredibly useful for businesses, and IBM is playing a critical role in enabling enterprises to tap into the technology.\n\nSurging free cash flow\n\nAfter a decade of uninspiring results and inconsistent revenue growth, IBM has settled into a groove. The company has shed slow-growing businesses and bet on its hybrid cloud computing and AI platforms. Revenue is not only growing again but accelerating, and profits are improving.\n\nFor 2025, IBM expects revenue at constant currency to grow by at least 5%. That may not seem all that quick, but IBM is still a sprawling company with numerous product and service offerings, and it's currently facing a slowdown in demand for discretionary tech projects.

The company acquired AI start-up Paperspace in mid-2023 to get its foot in the door. Under CEO Paddy Srinivasan, who took over in early 2024, DigitalOcean has been building out a full-scale AI computing platform.\n\nOn top of offering virtual servers outfitted with powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), DigitalOcean's new Gradient AI platform enables customers to build AI agents without managing infrastructure. The company's AI-related revenue more than doubled year over year in the second quarter, which was one reason why the stock exploded higher. The day after that earnings report, DigitalOcean stock soared nearly 29%.\n\nAI is helping reaccelerate growth for DigitalOcean, and the stock looks like a solid buy, despite the higher price tag.\n\nMoving in the right direction\n\nDigitalOcean's total revenue rose by 14% year over year in the second quarter, a bit faster than the 13% growth the company reported for the same period last year. Under the surface, revenue is shifting toward larger customers willing to spend more on the platform. The number of Scalers+ customers, which spend at least $100,000 annually on DigitalOcean's platform, rose by 23%, while the revenue generated by those large customers surged by 35%.\n\nThese larger customers help make DigitalOcean's revenue more reliable and predictable. The company still has plenty of small customers, with 174,000 customers who spend at least $50 per month. But 24% of total revenue now comes from the roughly 500 customers spending at least $100,000 per year on the platform.\n\nThis growth in larger customers and the improvement in the net dollar retention rate in the second quarter to 99% is partly due to DigitalOcean's quicker pace in launching new products and features. The company launched more than 60 new features across its cloud computing and AI products in the second quarter, including the general availability of its Gradient AI platform. While DigitalOcean must strike a balance between keeping its platform simple and rolling out new features, the AI industry is moving so quickly that the company can't afford to sit still.\n\nWith a strong second quarter under its belt, DigitalOcean raised its outlook for the full year. Revenue is now expected to grow by 13.8% to 14.3%, and the free-cash-flow margin is now expected to be between 17% and 19%. Free cash flow had taken a hit from the company's AI infrastructure investments, but it now appears to be recovering as the AI business takes flight.\n\nDigitalOcean's accelerating revenue growth and boosted guidance come despite a tough economic backdrop. By not having a customer base loaded with big enterprise customers, the company may be less exposed to the phenomenon of cloud customers hunting for cost savings during tough times.\n\nA reasonable valuation\n\nBased on DigitalOcean's outlook for 2025, the company is on track to generate around $160 million in free cash flow at the midpoint of its guidance range for the full year. With a market capitalization hovering around $3 billion, that puts the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio at just under 19.\n\nWith DigitalOcean's revenue growth accelerating, thanks in part to the company's progress building out its AI platform, that seems like a reasonable price to pay. While a volatile macroeconomic environment could negatively impact the company later this year, DigitalOcean's AI efforts look likely to drive revenue and free-cash-flow growth in the long run as companies embrace AI technology.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:07.594463+00:00"}

It's also one of the hottest large-cap tech stocks on the market. Only two members of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have delivered greater gains than Microsoft this year.\n\nMeta Platforms (META -0.49%) is one of them. Outside of gaming, Meta's and Microsoft's paths have rarely intersected in the past. However, Meta's newest artificial intelligence (AI) initiative could change that. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent explanation of his company's strategy could even be interpreted as a warning shot fired across Microsoft's bow.\n\nMeta's dream\n\nLess than two weeks ago, Zuckerberg described Meta's dream for superintelligence in a public statement. He said that Meta wants \"to bring personal superintelligence to everyone.\"\n\nWhat is superintelligence? It's similar to artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is defined differently by some but usually refers to AI that can learn and perform tasks at least as well as humans. Superintelligence goes further than AGI, though, with capabilities that far exceed humans.\n\nZuckerberg envisioned a future where every person has a \"personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.\" That sounds better than the dark predictions that AGI and superintelligence could eliminate many jobs and leave humans with little to do.\n\nIs Meta's dream pie in the sky? Maybe not. The company seems to be making tangible progress toward developing superintelligence. Zuckerberg said:\n\nOver the last few months we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves. The improvement is slow for now, but undeniable. Developing superintelligence is now in sight.\n\nMicrosoft investors' worst nightmare\n\nMeta's superintelligence vision might not seem to affect Microsoft at first blush. However, note something else Zuckerberg said: \"If trends continue, then you'd expect people to spend less time in productivity software, and more time creating and connecting.\"\n\nMicrosoft is practically synonymous with productivity software. Its apps, including Excel, Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Teams, all of which are now bundled into Microsoft 365, are used by millions of people across the world.\n\nIn the quarter ending June 30, 2025, Microsoft's productivity and business processes segment generated revenue of $33.1 billion. The segment is Microsoft's biggest moneymaker, contributing 43% of its total revenue.\n\nGranted, some of Microsoft's productivity and business processes segment revenue stems from LinkedIn. The professional networking social media platform doesn't fall into the category of productivity software. While Microsoft didn't release a specific revenue figure for LinkedIn, external estimates of the platform's revenue indicate that it likely accounts for less than 15% of the productivity and business processes segment's revenue.\n\nThe bottom line is that any major slashing of productivity-software revenue and profits would arguably be Microsoft investors' worst nightmare. And Zuckerberg has predicted that Meta's superintelligence initiative will lead to a significant drop in the time people spend using productivity software.\n\nCould Microsoft be in trouble?\n\nWhether or not Microsoft's business could be jeopardized by Meta's superintelligence efforts depends, in large part, on how successful those efforts are. Skepticism on this front could be warranted. Technology executives have made predictions in the past that didn't come true.\n\nHowever, I think there's another more important reason why Meta's superintelligence vision might not threaten Microsoft all that much. Note that Zuckerberg said that people would probably spend less time using productivity software; he didn't say that productivity software would be used less.\n\nThat's a critical distinction, because AI may continue to use productivity software. Microsoft itself is investing heavily in enabling AI to do many of the tasks that people have done in the past with its productivity software.\n\nIs Meta's superintelligence dream Microsoft investors' worst nightmare? I don't think so. Instead, I expect both Meta and Microsoft to enable long-term investors to sleep peacefully for a long time to come.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:08.930415+00:00"}

It has since recovered some of those losses but remains up just slightly year-to-date -- underperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nHere's why Amazon is out of favor, along with the biggest mistake investors make when buying the growth stock.\n\nAmazon's underwhelming guidance\n\nAmazon reported excellent quarterly results, including growing operating income far faster than revenue. However, its third-quarter guidance and anticipated growth slowdown in Amazon Web Services (AWS) may be reasons for the stock's pullback. The AWS results are particularly jarring, considering Microsoft (MSFT -0.16%) Azure and Alphabet's (GOOGL -0.27%) (GOOG -0.30%) Google Cloud are growing more quickly than AWS.\n\nWhat's more, Amazon's free cash flow plummeted to $18.2 billion for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $53 billion for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024. The company is deploying excess cash back into the business to invest in big ideas, such as building out AWS data centers, launching generative AI tools, expanding Amazon Prime delivery capabilities, and more. And yet, Amazon's third-quarter guidance calls for just 10% to 13% revenue growth and between an 11% decline in operating income and an 18% increase.\n\nAmazon's aggressive capital allocation strategy\n\nThe biggest mistake investors make when buying Amazon stock is not realizing that the company's modus operandi is plowing profits back into innovative ideas rather than booking short-term profits. Amazon takes a lot of risks, most of which have paid off and led to phenomenal long-term gains for patient investors. But this strategy also produces inconsistent earnings per share and cash flow. Amazon has fallen at least 25% from its all-time high three times in the last decade -- showcasing the stock's volatility.\n\nAmazon's stock-based compensation regularly exceeds its buybacks. Amazon hasn't repurchased stock in years, and it doesn't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, its stock-based compensation is over $20 billion for the trailing 12 months, and its outstanding share count continues to climb as Amazon dilutes existing shareholders.\n\nThis is a far different approach from other big tech giants like Apple (AAPL -0.92%), Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (META -0.49%). Like Amazon, these tech giants shell out billions in stock-based compensation each year to attract top talent, but they more than offset this expense with buybacks, which avoid dilution. In fact, having buybacks outpace stock-based compensation accelerates earnings growth by lowering the number of outstanding shares.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is ramping up spending in the pursuit of long-term growth. As you can see in the following chart, the company has grown its operating income at an impeccable pace over the last five years, but it has also magnified its capital expenditures.\n\nAWS remains the undisputed leader in the global cloud market, but its dominant market share is partly due to its entrenched position in the industry. In this vein, Amazon is making the right decision to reinvest profits in AWS to expand capacity and build out its AI capacity to bolster its competitive advantages. But investors will want to see these investments pay off.\n\nThe good news is that Amazon's valuation has gotten much more attractive as its earnings have grown and the stock price has stagnated. Amazon commands a 33.9 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- which is nearly identical to Microsoft's 33.6 forward P/E ratio.\n\nThe best way to approach Amazon stock\n\nInvestors who buy and hold Amazon stock must do so for the right reasons. Amazon's capital spending is surging, and if Wall Street doesn't see these investments pay off, the stock could keep tumbling.\n\nAmazon tends to get a shorter leash than other mega-cap names, so buying the stock requires a high risk tolerance. But this shorter leash is by design, as Amazon could easily pull back on spending and boost its cash flow or return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\n\nInvestors looking for a company with a more balanced capital allocation may want to consider Microsoft or Alphabet as preferred cloud plays over Amazon. However, Amazon is a decent valuation for folks looking to invest in the cloud and who believe in the strength of Amazon's core e-commerce and advertising business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:15.500097+00:00"}

Twenty years ago, the largest companies in the land hailed from the oil and industrial industries. For example, in 2005, the largest companies in the U.S., measured by market cap, were ExxonMobil and General Electric, worth $392 billion and $375 billion, respectively. Now, two decades later, technology enterprises, particularly those involved in artificial intelligence (AI), are at the top of the charts.\n\nThree of the world's most recognizable companies are at the forefront. AI chipmaker Nvidia leads the field at $4.3 trillion, within striking distance of a new all-time high. Software and cloud purveyor Microsoft also appears poised to climb to new heights, recently climbing to $3.9 trillion. Rounding out this tech trifecta is iPhone maker Apple at $3.1 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of $2.3 trillion, it might seem a bit premature to predict Amazon's (AMZN -0.70%) admission. After all, fair-weather investors have fled, and the stock is flat so far this year, weighed down by tariff-related uncertainty. However, other segments of Amazon's business appear poised to spark a renaissance in the company's growth, securing its membership in the $3 trillion club.\n\nThe tariff conundrum\n\nThe Trump administration's tariff policies remain in flux, and the resulting uncertainty is weighing on Amazon's stock. That's easy to understand, as third-party merchants generate roughly 62% of unit sales, and many of these goods are sourced from China. A recent deal set a minimum levy of 30% on Chinese imports, while some products are saddled with a higher rate. The recent trade agreement notwithstanding, investors are wary of the ongoing impact on Amazon's e-commerce sales.\n\nResults from the second quarter and Amazon's forecast seemed to confirm their worst fears. Overall net sales increased 13% year over year to $167.7 billion, with 61% of its revenue from digital sales or third-party seller services. The company's third-quarter outlook is telling. While Amazon is forecasting revenue growth of 11.5% at the midpoint of its guidance, it expects operating income to be essentially flat, in no small part thanks to tariffs.\n\nPartly cloudy\n\nThe good news is that its cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), won't be directly affected by tariffs. For context, AWS generated 19% of Amazon's revenue and 58% of operating income so far this year, helping insulate the company somewhat from tariffs.\n\nFurthermore, AWS is the worldwide leader in cloud infrastructure services, with a market share of 32% in Q1, according to market analyst Canalys. Furthermore, the segment is growing at a respectable pace, with sales of $31 billion representing a roughly 18% increase.\n\nGrowth has reaccelerated over the past year, driven by rising demand for AI. In June, CEO Andy Jassy pulled back the curtain, revealing that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and apps in development or already built, and the company plans to create many more. \"AI will be a substantial catalyst,\" Jassy said.\n\nAmazon's cloud customers represent a captive audience and target market for its AI products and services, which will be a catalyst for future growth.\n\nA distinct \"ad\"vantage\n\nAnother area fueling Amazon's growth is advertising, which is by far the company's fastest-growing segment. Ad revenue grew 23% year over year to $15.7 billion in Q2, and now accounts for more than 9% of total revenue. Its growth has expanded beyond in-search advertising, driven by Amazon Prime, live sports programming, Fire TV, and Twitch -- the company's live-streaming gaming platform.\n\nAmazon also recently inked deals with Roku and Disney to drive future growth. The company now reaches more than 80% of connected TV (CTV) households in the U.S., significantly expanding the reach of its advertising.\n\nThe path to $3 trillion\n\nAmazon has a market cap of roughly $2.32 trillion as of this writing, so it will only take a stock price increase of about 29% to boost its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $708 billion in 2025, resulting in a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would need revenue of roughly $914 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting Amazon's growth to be roughly 10% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that target, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2028.

This move cemented Nvidia's position as the world's most valuable company, beating out other tech heavyweights, including Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia has become the poster child for the accelerating adoption of AI, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) underpin the technology.\n\nAnother big development helped propel the stock higher. In a blog post published on July 14, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the company would resume sales of H20 chips to customers in China after a three-month moratorium. After the ban was issued in early April, Nvidia had taken a $4.5 billion charge related to these H20 chips. The charge combined with the $4.6 billion in quarterly sales that had already occurred suggested there was more than $9 billion in quarterly revenue at stake.\n\nIn the wake of this announcement, several Wall Street analysts issued bullish takes on the chipmaker, citing the resumption of sales in this important market.\n\nMore to come\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report the results of its fiscal 2026 second quarter after the market close on Aug. 27, and investors are likely in for a pleasant surprise. Management was guiding for revenue of about $45 billion, which would represent growth of 50%, but that was before the company resumed chip sales to China. Nvidia had a limited supply of its H20 chips in stock, so the full impact of the easing of import restrictions likely won't be felt until Q3. Furthermore, Nvidia has a history of issuing conservative guidance, so the results will likely be higher than its forecast.\n\nFinally, Nvidia controls about 90% of the data center GPU market, and spending by big tech on capital expenditure (capex) to support AI continues at a brisk pace. At the same time, Nvidia is selling for just 31 times next year's earnings, an attractive price for a company with so much opportunity.\n\nThat's why Nvidia stock is a buy.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:18.609714+00:00"}

Understanding this, Ocean made the decision to work with Gmail, not compete against it. As a third-party client, gaining a footing in the market can be difficult, but successful email apps have proven lucrative acquisitions. Yahoo bought email app Xobni for $60 million and Microsoft snapped up Accompli for $200 million in the previous decade, for instance.\n\nThis market opportunity attracted co-founders Martin Dufort and Scott Lake — an early Shopify co-founder — who created BigWave Labs in early 2019 and began to tackle email. This work ultimately resulted in Ocean, an app focused on more efficient email management. (Scott now functions as more of the app’s financial backer and advisor, Dufort says.)\n\nThe app works with Gmail or Google Workspace accounts, allowing users to turn their emails into tasks and action items so they’re not forgotten.\n\nTo make this work, the app includes its own Task Manager that has access to the user’s email. That means you don’t have to copy or paste information into an external to-do app while instead gaining access to features that go beyond what Google’s task manager offers Gmail users.\n\nWith Ocean, you can create tasks using rich formatting, set due dates, organize tasks into folders, and link emails to your task’s notes. It can also automatically pull out action items from longer emails for you.\n\nYou can choose to manage the emails you mean to reply to later by creating a task as well, instead of leaving them unread or applying a label of some sort.\n\nImage Credits:BigWave Labs Inc.\n\nFor inbox zero enthusiasts, the killer feature will be Ocean’s inbox triage tools.\n\nThe app lets you filter emails by categories like first-timers (people who emailed you for the first time), persistent pingers (people who email you repeatedly), and emails from your contacts. It can even surface emails that are marked as spam but might belong in your inbox, so you don’t miss anything important.\n\nOcean also offers subscription management tools — a feature Gmail recently added — in addition to the baseline email functions of composing, replying, flagging, archiving, and deleting email.\n\nPlus, Ocean offers built-in meeting scheduling tools that let you set your availability based on your pending and booked events. Here, you can set your open times and block others from booking those meetings at the last minute, which is a handy trick.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:24.313079+00:00"}

The company's cloud segment showed tentative recovery with revenues excluding consolidated subsidiaries growing 17% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, while AI-related products maintained triple-digit growth for five consecutive quarters. Recent launches, including Qwen-Max, QwQ-Plus reasoning model, and QVQ-Max visual processing, demonstrate technical capabilities, with management claiming performance matching Western rivals. However, these positives cannot mask deepening structural problems. Cloud growth remains sluggish compared to global peers, with public cloud revenues achieving only modest double-digit expansion while Microsoft's Azure rockets at 39%. The pivot toward high-quality revenues disguises market share losses and monetization failures. More troublingly, Alibaba canceled its cloud unit IPO, citing U.S. chip restrictions, exposing critical vulnerability to escalating technology sanctions that could cripple AI ambitions. The company's financial deterioration accelerates despite heavy investment. Free cash flow collapsed 70% year over year due to infrastructure spending and merchant refunds, while adjusted EBITDA declined 5% even as revenues grew. Core e-commerce faces margin compression with customer management revenues crawling at 1% growth. Chinese regulatory uncertainty persists as authorities maintain unpredictable intervention patterns. Alibaba confronts a combination of geopolitical hostility, competitive displacement, and strategic confusion that renders its AI investments potentially worthless. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicates a downward revision of 10.9% over the past 30 days to $8.58 per share. The market appears to be pessimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.\n\nAlibaba Group BABA and Microsoft MSFT represent two divergent paths in the global cloud and AI race. While Microsoft dominates Western enterprise computing through Azure and its OpenAI partnership, Alibaba maintains leadership in China's cloud market despite mounting challenges. Both companies have made massive AI commitments that will define their trajectories for years to come. Recent data from Synergy shows Microsoft achieved a 20% share of the global cloud market in second-quarter 2025, while Alibaba won 4% share. The timing for this comparison is critical as generative AI transforms cloud computing economics. Microsoft recently became the second company to surpass $4 trillion in market value following explosive Azure growth, while Alibaba announced a historic $53 billion infrastructure investment even as its stock languishes near decade lows.

Azure's remarkable 39% growth, reaching $75 billion annual revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter, demonstrates explosive adoption as organizations embrace AI capabilities at scale. The exclusive OpenAI partnership provides unmatched access to frontier models, while Azure AI Foundry's general availability supporting 1,900+ models establishes Microsoft as the comprehensive AI development ecosystem. Infrastructure leadership through first-to-market Nvidia GB200 deployment, achieving 865,000 tokens per second throughput, creates insurmountable competitive advantages.\n\n\n\nAI integration across Microsoft's portfolio multiplies growth vectors and deepens competitive moats. GitHub Copilot's evolution to autonomous coding agents, accelerating Microsoft 365 Copilot enterprise adoption, and Dynamics 365 AI enhancements drove commercial bookings past $100 billion. With remaining performance obligations hitting $368 billion, up 37% year over year, Microsoft enjoys extraordinary revenue visibility. The company's execution excellence shows in delivering 18% revenue growth to $76.4 billion while expanding operating margins to 44.9%, demonstrating pricing power that will persist as AI becomes mission-critical.\n\n\n\nStrategic advantages compound Microsoft's dominance. Leadership in multi-agent orchestration through Copilot Studio, pioneering enterprise AI governance via Entra Agent ID, and establishing industry standards with Model Context Protocol cement architectural control. Azure's 70+ region presence, each AI-optimized with liquid cooling, provides unmatched global scale. Revolutionary services like autonomous SRE Agents and Project Amelie automated ML pipelines position Microsoft years ahead. Microsoft offers unparalleled exposure to AI's transformative potential backed by proven execution and accelerating adoption.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microsoft’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $15.32 per share, indicating an upward revision of 2.3% over the past 30 days\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nValuation and Price Performance Comparison\n\nBoth stocks carry premium valuations but for opposite reasons. Microsoft's 33.42x forward P/E and 11.92x sales multiple reflect justified confidence in sustained growth, with the stock reaching record highs above $550. Alibaba stock is trading at a 12.92x P/E, masking fundamental deterioration.\n\nBABA vs. MSFT: P/E F12M Ratio\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhile Microsoft consistently achieves new highs, Alibaba stock has declined 9.3% over the past three months compared with Microsoft’s 15.8% growth.\n\nBABA Underperforms MSFT in 3-Month Period\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nMicrosoft decisively wins this comparison through superior AI execution, dominant positioning, and accelerating momentum. Azure's 39% growth crushes Alibaba's 6% expansion while Microsoft's proven AI monetization contrasts with Alibaba's struggling unit economics. Geographic advantages, regulatory stability, and enterprise trust create sustainable competitive moats that Alibaba cannot overcome despite massive spending. Microsoft's premium valuation reflects genuine growth while Alibaba's discount signals existential risks. Investors should buy Microsoft to capture AI's generational opportunity and sell Alibaba to avoid deteriorating fundamentals, regulatory uncertainty, and strategic displacement threatening permanent capital impairment. MSFT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas Alibaba has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\n\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NBIS has set ambitious 2025 goals of reaching $1.1 billion in annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) and $630 million in total group revenues. In the second quarter of 2025, the company delivered robust performance with $105.1 million in revenues, up 625% year over year and more than double the prior quarter, largely driven by the core artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure business.\n\nGlobal demand for AI-specific infrastructure is booming, with hyperscalers, startups and enterprises increasing GPU investments. In the second quarter, the company’s AI cloud infrastructure revenues soared, driven by robust customer demand for its copper GPUs and the platform operating at near-peak utilization.\n\nNebius’ core business is an AI cloud platform designed for intensive workloads, powered by in-house developed software and hardware with R&D hubs across Europe, North America and Israel. Nebius provides AI builders with the compute power, storage, managed services and tools required to build, fine-tune and deploy their models. The Group also operates businesses under distinct brands, including Avride and TripleTen.\n\nManagement reported that in the second quarter, the core unit achieved positive adjusted EBITDA ahead of schedule. The company had sold out its entire supply of previous-generation hoppers and chose to wait for the launch of the new generation of GPUs. With the new Blackwell GPUs entering the market at scale and its data center capacity expanding significantly in parallel, the company expects a substantial increase in sales by year-end. As a result, NBIS raised its year-end ARR guidance from the prior range of $700 million–$1 billion to $900 million–$1.1 billion.\n\nThe company is rapidly expanding, aiming for 220 MW of active or GPU-ready power by year-end, including data centers in New Jersey and Finland. It is also finalizing two major U.S. greenfield sites and targeting more than 1 GW of power by 2026 to capitalize on industry growth.\n\nNebius enhanced its cloud software to support growing capacity and large-scale clusters, expanded its customer base with major tech firms like Cloudflare, Prosus and Shopify, and maintained its lead as the go-to cloud provider for native AI startups.\n\nThe company raised more than $4 billion in capital so far and has a strong balance sheet, with access to more funds through its other businesses and investments like Avride, ClickHouse and Toloka. AI compute demand is growing fast, and the company is expanding capacity to boost growth in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHowever, increasing market competition and macroeconomic uncertainties may adversely impact NBIS’ growth trajectory.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe three largest hyperscalers — AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud — captured nearly 71% of the expanding market for cloud infrastructure services last year, according to a Gartner report published Wednesday.\n\nGlobal IaaS market growth showed no signs of slowing down, thanks to enterprise AI adoption plans, the analyst firm said. Cloud infrastructure services spend increased 22.5% year over year to $171.8 billion in 2024. In comparison, the market grew just 16.2% to $140 billion the prior year.\n\n“As enterprises continue to seek greater flexibility, improved resilience and optimized performance, there is sustained demand for cloud migration and modernization services,” Gartner Principal Analyst Hardeep Singh said in the report. “Enterprises want to transform their IT infrastructure by leveraging multiple platforms for AI and prioritizing modernization by migrating existing workloads to the cloud.”\n\nDive Insight:\n\nGenerative AI’s outsized appetite for high-capacity compute remains a driving force behind massive cloud infrastructure investments, as hyperscalers race to meet enterprise demand.\n\nOngoing efforts to expand cloud capacity were the prime mover behind a more than 50% year-over-year data center spending spike during the first three months of 2025, when infrastructure CapEx reached $134 billion, according to Dell’Oro Group. Cloud buildouts helped drive data center investments to over $450 billion last year, a 51% increase over the prior year, the analyst firm said in March.\n\nInfrastructure services constitute the bedrock of digital transformation, despite accounting for less than one-third of a global market that surpassed $600 billion last year, Gartner told CIO Dive. While software and platform services — SaaS and PaaS — account for the bulk of cloud spend, AI adoption is shifting hyperscaler and enterprise priorities.\n\n“Cloud providers are investing heavily in AI infrastructure and capabilities to become leaders in the rapidly evolving AI-optimized IaaS market,” Singh said. “They expect that AI will become a much larger revenue contributor in the future, even though it currently remains a relatively small slice of their overall revenue within the IaaS space.”\n\nAWS owned the largest share of the IaaS pie, with nearly 38% of the global market last year. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud captured 24% and 9%, respectively.\n\nGartner expects global cloud spend to top $700 billion in 2025, as the infrastructure services market expands by 25% year over year to more than $210 billion.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:36.404662+00:00"}

Many leading cybersecurity companies are also deeply invested in artificial intelligence (AI), utilizing the latest models to identify, detect, and eliminate threats more quickly than ever.\n\nHowever, with a plethora of cybersecurity stocks to choose from, it can be difficult to know which companies are true standouts. Here's why Palo Alto Networks (PANW 0.66%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.16%), and CrowdStrike (CRWD 0.43%) could be great stocks to buy and hold for the next decade.\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks\n\nUnsurprisingly, Palo Alto Networks tops this list right now after the company just announced a monster $25-billion deal to acquire fellow cybersecurity company CyberArk. The acquisition puts Palo Alto in a better position to take on rivals in the identity access management space.\n\nPalo Alto's stock dipped on the news, but there's good reason to believe it can successfully integrate CyberArk into its broadened suite of products, considering that the company has made nearly two dozen acquisitions over the past decade. CyberArk is a particularly expensive one, no doubt, but the company is also growing at a healthy clip, with sales rising 46% in Q2 to $328 million.\n\nPalo Alto had 80,000 customers before the acquisition, and its third quarter was impressive, with revenue rising 15% to $2.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings jumping about 21% to $0.80 per share. The company's shares took a recent dip after the CyberArk acquisition announcement, so investors may have a good buying opportunity before the company reports its Q4 results on Aug. 18.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft spans so many different technology opportunities that it's almost hard to keep up with them. As one of the top cloud computing companies -- and certainly the fastest growing, with sales from Azure and other cloud services up 39% in Q4 -- it's no surprise that Microsoft would need its own cybersecurity services to offer its customers.\n\nAzure is taking 21% of the cloud market, and Microsoft 365 is a mainstay of many offices, so the company benefits from upselling cybersecurity services to its millions of customers. The result is that it could generate an estimated $37 billion in cybersecurity sales this year.\n\nInvestors get the added benefit of Microsoft being a leading AI stock, as well. The company is on the cutting edge of integrating chatbots into its products and services and made early investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. That's already helped it expand AI-powered security, like its Microsoft Security Pilot and Azure AI Security services.\n\n3. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity pure play that's consistently on many tech investors' buy lists because it's so good at what it does. The company's Falcon security platform gives customers an all-in-one solution that's easy to set up and manage because it's 100% cloud-based.\n\nIf you're wondering whether or not it matters that Falcon is easy to use and offers a one-stop shop for cybersecurity, consider that CrowdStrike's customer-retention rate is currently hovering around 97%. The company's subscription gross margin is just as impressive and was at 77% in Q1 of fiscal 2026. CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) is $4.4 billion, and the company recently reiterated its goal of reaching $10 billion in ARR in the coming years.\n\nIf all of that's not impressive enough, consider that CrowdStrike is also a leader in cybersecurity AI, with the company launching its Charlotte AI tool two years ago. Charlotte can automatically detect and contain threats without managers having to lift a finger. The company estimates it saves customers about 40 hours per week.\n\nAny of the above companies will likely be a good long-term investment over the next decade as AI-powered cybersecurity threats increase. If I had to pick one right now, I'd personally choose Microsoft, since it has additional opportunities for growth in AI and cloud computing. But each one has its own unique approach in the market and will likely be a good investment in the coming years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:14:58.152332+00:00"}

That alliance is now paying off, CEO Alexandre L'Heureux said on a second-quarter earnings call Aug. 7.\n\n“In our bidding group … we believe that very soon we will be able to reduce some of our human output by close to 80%,” L’Heureux said. “So that's not de minimis, because we have bidding groups across each and every segment and across each and every country. So that's an example of where we feel we can make a tremendous improvement and reduce human intervention.”\n\nIt’s not just AI creating those results, though: In the past decade, the Montreal-based construction giant’s revenue per employee has seen constant growth while labor became cheaper, according to L’Heureux.\n\n“Our revenue at the moment is growing much faster than our headcount,” L’Heureux said. “That's why today, unlike perhaps five, six, seven years ago, I am not talking as much about headcount as we used to. To me, it's becoming more irrelevant.”\n\nAlthough the market is still “very, very dynamic,” WSP has not seen much election-related disruption amid recent or upcoming votes in major markets including New Zealand, the U.K., Australia, Canada and the U.S., according to L'Heureux.\n\nEven with regime change in the U.S. and U.K., infrastructure spending remains a top priority for both of those countries, L’Heureux said. Although President Donald Trump’s administration has brought some shifts in priorities — for instance, away from renewables and towards fossil fuels — he aims to facilitate and expedite investment.\n\nProjects and sectors\n\nData centers and related projects remain hot, with “robust activity across all of our geographies,” according to L’Heureux.\n\n“Mandates encompass site acquisition, due diligence, master planning for new AI factories, greenfield data center design projects, brownfield data center upgrades and the growing power and water infrastructure demand,” L’Heureux said.\n\nWSP has also seen “tremendous growth in power generation,” L’Heureux said, citing thermal and nuclear energy in particular. To that end, Power Engineers, the Hailey, Idaho-based engineering and environmental consulting firm it purchased in August 2024, had an organic growth rate of 16% this quarter.\n\n“It was a must-do deal, and I'm extremely pleased that we completed this acquisition. It's very, very strategic for our platform,” L’Heureux said. “I'm feeling very bullish on this acquisition and very bullish around this [power generation] sector.”\n\nWater continues to benefit from investment across most of WSP’s geographies, L’Heureux said. The firm recently secured a role in an Ontario wastewater treatment plant expansion, as well as a major PFAS project for the U.S. Air Force in the Midwest that “shows our strong position in the combined defense and water markets,” according to L’Heureux.\n\nDespite the Trump administration’s reversal of environmental projects and protections, WSP’s environmental backlog has continued to grow, even in the U.S., L’Heureux said. In particular, WSP’s biodiversity and marine expertise are in high demand in Canada.\n\nThe transportation infrastructure sector, including rail, continued to perform well, per L’Heureux. WSP won a role in the $3.9 billion Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel project in Virginia, as well as in the new terminal of Perth International Airport in Australia.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nWSP reported revenues of $4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.3 billion) in its second quarter earnings, up 14.6% from CA$3.9 billion in Q2 2024. The firm’s profits grew to CA$279 million in Q2 2025, up nearly 52% from the same period last year.\n\nBacklog stood at CA$16.3 billion, a 10.9% increase from Q2 2024.\n\nThat was due mostly to continued strong performance in Canada, the Americas and Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, according to WSP CFO Alain Michaud, and to the fact that WSP reduced its presence in the Asia-Pacific region in the first half of the year after its performance slowed.\n\n“Clients are recognizing the expertise that we bring to the table,” L’Heureux said. “It allows us to be more selective in the projects that we undertake, but it also allows us to charge for the great work that our engineers are doing.”\n\nMore M&A\n\nAlthough L’Heureux noted last quarter that election-related uncertainty was dampening the M&A market, he said his firm is continuing to pursue merger and acquisition opportunities.\n\nIn June WSP acquired Lexica, a U.K.-headquartered consulting firm specializing in healthcare and life sciences, which adds 90 experts to the firm’s Planning, Property and Advisory business in the region and forms a new Healthcare and Life Sciences Advisory team.\n\nWSP also announced an agreement in June to purchase the U.K.-based consultancy Ricardo, which delivers strategic advisory and engineering solutions that intersect the global transport, energy and environment agenda.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T15:01:15.741245+00:00"}
