The website of the Department of Government Efficiency, the agency he created to spearhead those efforts, lists over $14 billion in Defense Department contracts it claims to have cancelled.\n\nThe reason for the unusual move: officials at those departments, who have so far put the existing projects on hold, want other firms, including Salesforce and billionaire Peter Thiel's Palantir, to have a chance to win similar projects, which could amount to a costly do-over, according to seven sources familiar with the matter.\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump 's Navy and Air Force are poised to cancel two nearly complete software projects that took 12 years and well over $800 million combined to develop, work initially aimed at overhauling antiquated human resources systems.\n\nStory Continues\n\n'STRATEGIC PAUSE'\n\nIn 2019, Accenture said it had won a contract to expand an HR platform to modernize the payroll, absence management, and other HR functions for the Air Force with Oracle software.\n\nThe project, which includes other vendors and was later expanded to include Space Force, grew to cost $368 million and was scheduled for its first deployment this summer at the Air Force Academy.\n\nAn April \"status update\" on the project conducted by the Air Force and obtained by Reuters described the project as \"on track,\" with initial deployment scheduled for June, noting that it would end up saving the Air Force $39 million annually by allowing it to stop using an older system.\n\nBut on May 30, Darlene Costello, then-Acting assistant Secretary of the Air Force, sent out a memo placing a \"strategic pause\" on the project for ninety days and calling for the study of alternate technical solutions, according to a copy of the memo seen by Reuters that was previously unreported.\n\nCostello, who has since retired, was reacting to pressure from other Air Force officials who wanted to steer a new HR project to SalesForce and Palantir , three sources said.\n\nPalantir co-founder Thiel was an early backer of President Donald Trump and has close ties with key Washington lawmakers, including Vice President JD Vance, whom he supported in a 2022 U.S. Senate race.\n\nPalantir in April won a $30 million contract from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to develop an operating system that identifies undocumented immigrants and tracks self-deportations, its largest single award from the agency among 46 federal contract actions since 2011.\n\nThe Air Force said in a statement that it \"is committed to reforming acquisition practices, assessing the acquisition workforce, and identifying opportunities to improve major defense acquisition programs.\"\n\nAccenture, Costello, Palantir and SalesForce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSpace Force, which operates within the Air Force, was set to receive the Air Force's new payroll system in the coming months. But it is also pulling out of the project because officials there want to launch yet another HR platform project to be led by Workday, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe service put out a small business tender on May 7 for firms to research HR platform alternatives, with the goal of selecting a company that will recommend Workday as the best option, the people said.\n\nSpace Force did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nNow the Air Force and Space Force \"want to start over with vendors that do not meet their requirements, leading to significant duplication and massive costs,\" said John Weiler, director of the Information Technology Acquisition Advisory Council, a government-chartered nonprofit group that makes recommendations to improve federal IT contracting.\n\nOracle said in a statement it was \"working closely with DOGE to accelerate the government's transformation to modern technology at the best price for the taxpayer.\"\n\n'BEYOND EXASPERATED'\n\nIn 2022, the Honolulu-based Nakupuna Companies took over a 2019 project with other firms to integrate the Navy's payroll and personnel systems into one platform using Oracle software and known as \"NP2\".\n\nThe project, which has cost about $425 million since 2023, according to the Government Accountability Office, was set to be rolled out earlier this year after receiving a positive review by independent reviewer and consulting firm Guidehouse in January, according to a copy obtained by Reuters.\n\nBut the head of Navy's human resources, now retired Admiral Rick Cheeseman, sought to cancel the project according to a June 5 memo seen by Reuters, directing another official to \"take appropriate contractual actions\" to cancel the project.\n\nNavy leaders instead mandated yet another assessment of project, according to a memo seen by Reuters, leaving it in limbo, two sources said.\n\nCheeseman's reason for trying to kill the project was his anger over a decision by DOGE earlier this year to cancel a $171 million contract for data services provider Pantheon Data that essentially duplicated parts of the HR project. In an email obtained by Reuters, he threatened to withhold funding from the Nakupuna-led project unless the Pantheon contract was restored.\n\n\"I am beyond exasperated with how this happened,\" Cheeseman wrote in a May 7 email to Chief Information Officer Jane Rathbun about the contract cancellation, arguing the Pantheon contract was not \"duplicative of any effort.\"\n\n\"From where I sit, I’m content taking every dime away from NP2 in order to continue this effort,\" he added in the email.\n\nCheeseman did not respond to a request for comment. Rathbun and Pantheon Data declined to comment.\n\nThe pausing of NP2 was \"unexpected, especially given that multiple comprehensive reviews validated the technical solution as the fastest and most affordable approach,\" Nakupuna said in a statement, adding it was disappointed by the change because the project was ready to deploy.\n\nThe Navy said it \"continues to prioritize essential personnel resources in support of efforts to strengthen military readiness through fiscal responsibility and departmental efficiency.\"\n\n(Reporting by Alexandra Alper, Additional Reporting by Mike Stone and Brad Heath; editing by Chris Sanders and Anna Driver)", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:38:24.815049+00:00"}

(MNDY) shares grabbed investor attention in Europe on Tuesday, with some analysts saying the drop reflected concerns over the long-term competitive threat of AI as much as results that failed to meet higher investor expectations.\n\nSuch worries fueled big losses across the sector.

(NYSE:CRM) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Salesforce\n\nThe President, Srinivas Tallapragada, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$253 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$233. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.\n\nIn the last twelve months insiders purchased 5.58k shares for US$1.5m. But insiders sold 36.14k shares worth US$9.5m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Salesforce shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Salesforce insiders own about US$5.8b worth of shares (which is 2.5% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Salesforce Tell Us?\n\nThere haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Salesforce, we can't say the same about the selling of shares.

Profound, which claims it was the first to stake out this post-SEO space, today announced a $35 million Series B funding round led by Sequoia Capital, with continued backing from venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins, Khosla Ventures, Saga VC, and South Park Commons. The new round brings its total funding to $58.5 million.\n\nSince launching less than a year ago, the New York City–based company has signed Fortune 10 clients and hundreds more, though it could publicly name only a few, including Ramp, U.S. Bank, Indeed, MongoDB, Docusign, and Chime. Profound says 2,000 marketers from over 500 organizations now use its platform daily as brands race to secure their place in the AI-first internet. And the race is heating up: According to the Wall Street Journal, AI-powered chatbots now account for more than 5% of U.S. desktop search traffic—up from just 1.3% in early 2024.\n\nSequoia partner Anas Biad told Fortune the firm’s big bet is on cofounders James Cadwallader, a serial marketing entrepreneur, and Dylan Babbs, a former Uber software engineer. The two met at South Park Commons, a San Francisco community and early-stage fund founded in 2016 by Ruchi Sanghvi, Facebook’s first female engineer, and Aditya Agarwal, former Dropbox CTO. Sequoia views the rise of AI search as a once-in-a-generation platform shift for marketers—one it believes Profound is poised to lead by helping brands monitor how they and their competitors surface in AI-generated results and produce new content to keep pace.\n\n“Their speed of execution was truly remarkable—in both the product they built and the customers they landed,” said Biad. “We only back founders who want to build generational companies. Their team is very ambitious and very aggressive.”\n\nCadwallader, who previously founded influencer marketing firm Kyra, has called the change a “Game of Thrones power shift” from decades of search engine optimization tactics to a new world of AI search. He said he became “obsessed” with Perplexity in early 2024. “It was so obvious to me that this was an inflection point—once you’ve used AI to search, you quickly understand why our children won’t be using [Google’s] blue links.”\n\nBut the shift is bigger than search, he emphasized: It will change the internet itself and become a boardroom-level problem for every marketer. If AI chatbots become the primary way people search, brands will lose direct visibility and control over how they appear to consumers online. That’s not just a marketing issue, he explained—it’s a business challenge that touches revenue, customer acquisition, competitive positioning, and brand identity.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:38:32.143203+00:00"}

On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nco-founders of datumo Image Credits:Datumo\n\nMeta’s recent $14.3 billion acquisition-like investment in data-labeling company Scale AI highlights the importance of this market.

The stock has declined 28% in 2025, a steeper fall than the 13.5% drop in the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.\n\nCompared to key competitors like SAP SE SAP, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Oracle Corporation ORCL, Salesforce’s slump appears even more pronounced.

After years of consistent double-digit revenue increases, the momentum has faded. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues rose just 7.7% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew by only 5.7%.\n\nThis slowdown reflects cautious enterprise spending amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical pressures. Analysts anticipate that this trend will persist, with mid-to-high single-digit growth expected for fiscal 2026 and 2027.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe impact is also visible in profit forecasts. Salesforce’s EPS is now expected to witness a CAGR of 12.9% over the next five years, a big drop from the 27.8% CAGR it posted over the previous five years.\n\nThis changing growth profile shows how businesses are adjusting their IT budgets. Instead of large digital transformation projects, many are opting for smaller, lower-risk investments. For Salesforce, this means it has to adapt its strategy to stay competitive and relevant.\n\nSalesforce’s Low Valuation: Is It a Trap?\n\nLooking at Salesforce’s earnings multiple, the stock looks cheap. Salesforce currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 20.08, significantly lower than the sector’s average of 28.15.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock also trades at a lower P/E multiple compared with its top peers, including SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. At present, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have P/E multiples of 38.32, 36.17 and 33.42, respectively.\n\nWith CRM’s discounted valuation, investors might be considering buying the stock. However, considering the ongoing challenges related to its slowing sales growth, the lucrative valuations could be a value trap for investors. The slump in its share price and discounted valuation reflects the company’s dismal growth outlook.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:38:45.869546+00:00"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Trial Balance is CFO.com’s weekly preview of stories, stats and events to help you prepare.\n\nPart 1 — Salesforce COFO says she’s using AI to prep for earnings calls. Plus, a third of finance chiefs are adopting an “aggressive” approach to artificial intelligence.\n\nRobots aren’t drafting up 10-Qs, 10-Ks or any other SEC filings for PayPal or Salesforce quite yet, but both companies are apparently betting big on a future driven by artificial intelligence tools.\n\nIn a roundtable discussion with reporters on Thursday, finance chiefs from the two firms spoke glowingly of the business potential of agentic AI tools, that is, artificial intelligence programs designed to make decisions autonomously with little or no human intervention.\n\nJamie Miller, chief financial and operating officer at PayPal, emphasized that, for now, her team is using AI agents to produce first drafts of internal content. That includes things like “executive-level materials, where it’s really summarization of a strategy,” she told reporters.\n\n“We have not yet done, at least to my knowledge, AI-generated 10-Ks,” she said. “I think we’ll work our way to some form of assistance on that. … Within finance itself, there are lots of opportunities to leverage AI, and we see a lot of that internally.”\n\nRobin Washington, who started her role as Salesforce’s first chief operating and financial officer four months ago, said that she personally uses AI tools to prepare for analyst questions and to better understand competition. “We are very much using [AI] to astutely understand the landscape,” she said. Washington added that artificial intelligence has helped cut down her prep work for earnings calls to “hours instead of days.”\n\nThough the discussion was mostly sparse on other concrete use cases for rank-and-file employees, both finance chiefs maintained that AI tools are set to fundamentally change the workforce, eventually.\n\n“My boss always says we’re probably the last set of managers to just manage humans,” Washington said. “We’re going to have AIs autonomously working side-by-side helping us make decisions.”\n\nIn an email, Salesforce spokesman Tyler Ng said that the company’s “Agentforce for Sales” program “helps reps spend more time selling by letting AI handle routine tasks like lead follow-up and outreach around the clock.”\n\n“Recently, the AI agent analyzed over 7,800 unworked leads — accounts with no rep outreach or activity — to prioritize high-intent prospects, personalize messaging and book 50+ meetings, generating $460K in net-new pipeline in just three weeks,” he said. “The real power comes from AI and humans working together: while AI handles repetitive tasks, reps focus on building relationships and closing deals.”\n\nAnd while big-ticket AI investments have coincided with recent layoff plans at several companies, such as Microsoft, the finance heads of Salesforce and PayPal emphasized that the emerging technology will instead reinforce the need for human skills. Washington cited things like “problem-solving, emotional intelligence and higher-level decision making.”\n\n“AI brings the data directly to us, and it enhances our ability to … do the art of the possible,” she said.\n\nFor her part, Miller emphasized the continued need for “curiosity, systems thinking, self-starting” among employees.\n\n“I was in a board meeting last week, and someone joked, ‘sounds like it’s the revenge of the liberal arts grad, finally,’” she said.\n\nThe two leaders’ roundtable discussion coincided with the release of new survey data from Salesforce measuring CFO sentiment on AI. In a survey of 261 global finance chiefs, the company found that about a third have adopted an \"aggressive” approach to the emerging technology. Just 4% said they have a “conservative” AI strategy, and the lion’s share of respondents (63%) said they’re taking a moderate approach.\n\nConducted in June in partnership with Morning Consult, the survey also found that respondents, on average, are allocating about a quarter of their existing AI budgets specifically to AI agents.\n\nMeanwhile, 61% of the CFOs said that “AI agents/digital labor” are “critical” to competition. The company “defines digital labor as a hybrid workforce where humans and autonomous AI agents work together to accomplish more than either could on their own,” spokesman Ng said. In addition, about a third of respondents said that artificial intelligence “requires them to have a riskier mindset around technology investments.”\n\nPart 2 — This week\n\nHere’s a list of important market events slated for the week ahead.\n\nMonday, Aug. 11 — None scheduled.\n\nTuesday, Aug. 12\n\nWednesday, Aug. 13\n\nThursday, Aug. 14\n\nFriday, Aug. 15\n\nPart 3 — Weekly listen: St. Louis Blues exec on Business of Sports podcast\n\nSteve Chapman, EVP and chief revenue and marketing officer of professional ice hockey team the St. Louis Blues, talked to Business of Sports: Playmakers Beyond the Competition hosts Ken Dubinsky and Chris Roseman, to discuss his love of hockey, undergoing the process of changing the team’s logo and jerseys and streaming’s effect on sports media.\n\nWhen discussing the switch to streaming, Chapman highlighted that it allows the team to bring the product directly to the fans, but it’s not without challenges\n\n“The challenge is the financial model is changing and and if anybody tells you that they know exactly what's going on, they're lying because they don't,” Chapman said. “Everybody's trying to figure out how to build bridges to wherever it is that we're going to end up. And so that's what we're doing right now. I think that's what a lot of teams in professional [sports] are doing related to local regional sports networks,” Chapman said.\n\nHe continued: “It is something that is at the forefront of what we're working on right now, but I've got to tell you, it's actually unbelievably interesting. It's unbelievably motivating to try to figure out how to take this to the next level because at the end of the day, you want to give the product to the fans.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:38:50.994066+00:00"}

AI is already transforming businesses. And it's already making some investors quite wealthy.\n\nThe right AI investments could make you plenty of money, too. But which stocks are great picks right now? Wall Street analysts have some ideas you might want to check out. Here are three AI stocks that analysts think could soar more than 40% over the next 12 months.\n\n1. Atlassian\n\nFinancial data and infrastructure provider LSEG surveyed 31 analysts in August who cover team collaboration and productivity software company Atlassian (TEAM -0.80%). Twenty-five of them rated the stock as either a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" The remaining six analysts recommended holding shares of the software company.\n\nWhat's even more striking is their expectations of how the stock will perform. The average 12-month price target for Atlassian reflects an upside potential of around 60%. Even the most pessimistic analyst thinks the stock could jump 23% over the next 12 months.\n\nAtlassian certainly needs a strong rebound. The stock has plunged roughly 30% year to date and is almost 50% below the 52-week high set in February. Several factors caused this steep decline, including disappointing quarterly results earlier this year and insider selling.\n\nHowever, Atlassian's business remains strong. The company's revenue jumped 22% year over year in its latest quarter to nearly $1.4 billion. CEO and co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes noted in the quarterly update, \"AI is fundamentally changing the way we work, and creating significant tailwinds for Atlassian in the process.\"\n\n2. Salesforce\n\nSentiment on Wall Street is also remarkably strong for Salesforce (CRM -0.44%). Of the 54 analysts LSEG surveyed in August, 42 rated the software stock as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\" Ten analysts recommended holding Salesforce, with one outlier thinking investors should sell the stock.\n\nSalesforce could have a lot of room to run. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock is 45% above the current share price. One especially bullish analyst thinks Salesforce could skyrocket more than 80% higher.\n\nLike Atlassian, though, Salesforce hasn't been a winner so far in 2025. Its stock is down almost 30% year to date. Some analysts are skeptical about the company's planned acquisition of data management provider Informatica for $8 billion.\n\nSalesforce, though, views the Informatica deal as a smart move to bolster its agentic AI strategy. While the company awaits the closing of the transaction, it recently launched Agentforce 3, a platform that helps organizations deploy AI agents at scale.\n\n3. Adobe\n\nWall Street is upbeat about Adobe's (ADBE 1.37%) prospects, too. Twenty-seven of the 40 analysts surveyed by LSEG in August rated the AI-powered software stock as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" Of the remaining analysts, 11 recommended holding Adobe, with two rating the stock as an \"underperform.\"\n\nThe average 12-month price target for Adobe reflects an upside potential of around 42%. One analyst, though, thinks the stock could soar nearly 79% higher over the next 12 months.\n\nIt's pretty much the same song but a different verse when it comes to Adobe's stock performance this year. Similar to Atlassian and Salesforce, Adobe has disappointed investors with its shares sinking more than 20%. The stock is more than 40% below its 52-week high set in September 2024.\n\nSome investors are concerned that Adobe's integration of generative AI into its suite of products could take longer than hoped to deliver a solid return on investment. Increasing competition is also seen as a threat.\n\nOn a positive note, though, Adobe reported record revenue in Q2 of $5.87 billion, up 11% year over year. And while there's some hesitance outside the company about its AI integration, customers seem to like what Adobe has done so far. CEO Shantanu Narayen noted in the Q2 earnings call, \"The creative opportunity is expanding across audiences with AI as an accelerant.\"", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:38:52.380377+00:00"}

Then-CFO Amy Weaver was also poised to exit her post after previously announcing plans to step down.\n\nThe decision to combine the two roles is allowing the tech giant to “break down silos” and move with greater speed, according to Washington.\n\n“I think it makes the COFO organization a much more effective business partner to be in front of operations, to be supporting and fueling the business forward in a lot of different ways,” she said at the AI roundtable, which also included PayPal CFO Jamie Miller.\n\nMiller said her team is using AI agents to create internal content around data analysis as well as first drafts of “executive level materials where it’s really summarization of a strategy.” Both she and Washington said their teams haven’t yet used AI to generate documents such as public 10-K forms required by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSalesforce convened the event to highlight research showing that CFOs are becoming more bullish when it comes AI adoption.\n\nOf 261 CFOs surveyed globally, only 4% reported having a conservative AI strategy, down from 70% in 2020.\n\n“This rapid transformation highlights a widespread recognition among financial leaders that AI is no longer just an emerging technology but a crucial tool for enhancing efficiency, optimizing operations, and, critically, driving long-term growth,” according to a summary of the findings.\n\nRespondents said they expect AI agents in particular to increase company revenue by almost 20%. On average, CFOs reported allocating 25% of their current total AI budgets for agents.\n\nSalesforce is among big tech companies that have been betting heavily on the future of agentic AI technology. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has indicated plans for deploying one billion agents by the end of 2025.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:38:53.979707+00:00"}

Or is this a case of a company fueled by heightened investor enthusiasm? Find out in our full research report, it’s free.\n\nWhy Does Veeva Systems Spark Debate?\n\nBuilt on top of Salesforce as one of the first vertical-focused cloud platforms, Veeva (NYSE:VEEV) provides data and customer relationship management (CRM) software for organizations in the life sciences industry.\n\nTwo Positive Attributes:\n\n1. Billings Growth Boosts Cash On Hand\n\nBillings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called “cash revenue” because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract.\n\nVeeva Systems’s billings punched in at $723.6 million in Q1, and over the last four quarters, its year-on-year growth averaged 15.5%. This performance was solid, indicating robust customer demand. The cash collected from customers also enhances liquidity and provides a solid foundation for future investments and growth.\n\nVeeva Systems Billings\n\n2. Excellent Free Cash Flow Margin Boosts Reinvestment Potential\n\nIf you’ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can’t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n\nVeeva Systems has shown terrific cash profitability, driven by its lucrative business model and cost-effective customer acquisition strategy that enable it to stay ahead of the competition through investments in new products rather than sales and marketing. The company’s free cash flow margin was among the best in the software sector, averaging an eye-popping 41.5% over the last year.\n\nVeeva Systems Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin\n\nOne Reason to be Careful:\n\nLong-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints\n\nExamining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, Veeva Systems grew its sales at a 14.1% compounded annual growth rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds. Luckily, there are other things to like about Veeva Systems.\n\nVeeva Systems Quarterly Revenue\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nVeeva Systems’s positive characteristics outweigh the negatives, and with its shares topping the market in recent months, the stock trades at 14.8× forward price-to-sales (or $282.13 per share).

This move aligns with Salesforce's broader strategy to expand its AI and data solutions, as outlined in the company's narrative surrounding Data Cloud and Agentforce initiatives. While these developments set the stage for potential revenue growth, concerns remain about competition, pricing model transitions, and external factors that could impede progress. Despite a 7% decline in the stock last week, Salesforce's total shareholder return was 30.13% over three years, indicating a positive momentum over the longer term.\n\nWhen contextualizing Salesforce's performance, it's important to note that although its stock underperformed the US software industry and broader market over the past year, the long-term growth reflects potential resilience. Moreover, Salesforce's revenue and earnings forecasts remain vital concerns, with analysts projecting a 9.6% annual revenue growth and expanding profit margins. Today's stock price of $240.88 shows about a 45% discount to the consensus price target of $349.41, suggesting room for growth according to analyst expectations.

The Dow has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the addition of growth stocks such as Salesforce in 2020 and Amazon and Nvidia in 2024. However, the index remains a great starting point for finding top dividend stocks.\n\nHere's why these Fool.com contributors think Honeywell International (HON 0.26%) of the industrial sector, financial sector representative American Express (AXP 2.30%), and consumer staples stalwart Coca-Cola (KO -0.02%) are three great dividend stocks to buy now, even though they are hovering around all-time highs.\n\nHoneywell's breakup will create value for investors\n\nLee Samaha (Honeywell): Despite the recent sell-off of the industrial stock, it remains close to its all-time high price.\n\nThe investment case for this Dow Jones member currently revolves around its impending breakup and the amount of value that can be released in its constituent parts as they trade as stand-alone companies.\n\nIt's a breakup with an understandable rationale. For example, aerospace companies (Honeywell Aerospace will be the largest of the three new companies) are traditionally valued differently from industrial companies to reflect the long-cycle nature of their business.\n\nHoneywell Automation (set to be the remaining company) combines building automation and industrial automation, and its separation is part of a trend of industrial companies becoming more focused as automation becomes more software-driven by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalization technologies. It's a trend followed by peers like Emerson Electric, Siemens, and Johnson Controls.\n\nFinally, the advanced materials business (Solstice Advanced Materials) will offer investors an opportunity to invest in a pure-play sustainable materials business.\n\nAs you can see from this short description, they are significantly different businesses. When separated into three more focused and agile companies with their own capital raising dynamics and sets of investors behind them, they will have an opportunity to release value for investors.\n\nAmerican Express remains a good value for long-term investors\n\nDaniel Foelber (American Express): The financial services company is knocking on the door of an all-time high for all the right reasons. American Express continues to deliver excellent results despite pressures on consumer spending by catering to affluent customers.\n\nAmerican Express charges relatively high fees for its top credit cards, but it makes those fees worth it by offering cardholders attractive perks -- such as high baseline cash back rates and a variety of reward redemption options.\n\nUnlike Visa and Mastercard, American Express is both a payment processor and a card issuer. Its revenue stream is diverse, consisting of card fees, as well as transaction fees related to card usage frequency and volume.\n\nIt's a near-perfect business model -- as long as American Express customers pay off their loans. In its latest quarter (second quarter of 2025), American Express reported a 2% net write-off rate. It defines net write-off as a principal loss from a consumer or small business card member, net of what American Express was able to recover (interest not included). Net write-offs are also known as net charge-offs.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, net charge-off rates on credit card banks at all commercial banks for the first quarter of 2025 were 4.44%. This means that American Express does an exceptional job of managing risk and limiting steep losses from customers not paying their loans.\n\nAmerican Express is similar to an insurance company that has a track record of above-average underwriting -- like those owned by Berkshire Hathaway (American Express also happens to be one of Berkshire's largest holdings). In other words, the risk American Express is taking is of high quality relative to the industry -- which makes investing in the company more appealing.\n\nOver the last three years, American Express stock has soared 130.3% compared to 43.2% diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth. So the stock isn't as cheap as it used to be -- with a 21.8 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 17.2 10-year median P/E. However, American Express is arguably worth the premium price due to the strength of its underlying business model and clear path toward future earnings growth.\n\nPut some pop in your passive income stream with Coca-Cola\n\nScott Levine (Coca-Cola): Although shares of Coca-Cola have trended lower over the past few weeks, it was only a few months ago that shares had been their most effervescent.\n\nOn April 22, Coca-Cola stock bubbled up to uncharted territory when it climbed to an intraday high of $74.38 and ultimately closed at $73.90. Since then, shares have retreated from that level, falling about 6% as of this writing. Nonetheless, shares are hardly sporting a frothy valuation, and investors looking to quench their thirst for passive income would be wise to consider Coca-Cola stock along with its forward-yielding 2.9% dividend.\n\nThose who only know Coca-Cola for the legendary namesake soft drink may be surprised to learn that the company has consistently acquired a variety of brands over the years. From its acquisition of Minute Maid, a popular juice brand, to gaining a well-known iced tea brand with the acquisition of Honest Tea, to picking up a recognizable milk name in its acquisition of Fairlife, Coca-Cola has diversified its portfolio considerably over the decades. As lifestyle trends shift toward consumers adopting healthier habits, Coca-Cola is well-positioned to prosper from its robust portfolio of consumer beverage brands.\n\nIn addition to owning the title of the world's largest beverage company, Coca-Cola wears the crown of Dividend King, having consistently hiked its distribution for 63 consecutive years. While it's not a guarantee that the company will rack up another six decades of dividend hikes, it's certainly an auspicious sign that management is committed to rewarding shareholders.\n\nA cursory glance at Coca-Cola's valuation suggests that today's not a great time to click the buy button. Shares are trading a 21.7 times operating cash flow. Dig a little deeper, however, and investors will find that the valuation is actually a discount to the stock's five-year average cash flow multiple of 22.6. As an industry leader with a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders, Coca-Cola stock is a great option now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:39:04.427139+00:00"}

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Salesforce's current trading price of US$249 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Salesforce’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nWhat Is Salesforce Worth?\n\nGood news, investors! Salesforce is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $328.95, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Salesforce’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nWhat kind of growth will Salesforce generate?\n\nNYSE:CRM Earnings and Revenue Growth August 7th 2025\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 65% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Salesforce. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CRM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:39:09.299435+00:00"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nSeismic, a sales enablement software platform used by large go-to-market teams, is closing in on $400 million in annual recurring revenue and has already reached profitability. Behind that highly sought-after mark is an in-sync CFO-chief revenue officer relationship between Evan Goldstein and Hayden Stafford.\n\nGoldstein, who joined Seismic as CFO in 2022 after leadership roles at Genentech and Salesforce, is a first-time finance chief focused on creating what he calls “structured chaos”— supporting innovation while enforcing financial rigor. Stafford, the company’s CRO and an enterprise sales veteran with prior stints at IBM, Salesforce and Microsoft, joined around the same time. Though they didn’t work together directly during their shared time at Salesforce, at Seismic, they’ve built a model for high-growth SaaS leadership that’s based on collaboration, transparency and shared ownership of growth and profitability.\n\n“In many ways, [collaboration with leadership] is like parenting,” Goldstein said. “Disagreements rise to the top, and we have to present a united front. Hayden and I have invested in the relationship, and that’s made us far more effective at managing any tension and keeping the organization moving forward.”\n\nLaying the groundwork\n\nOne of Goldstein’s priorities as CFO was rebuilding Seismic’s finance organization, moving it beyond accounting to become a forward-looking strategic partner. “The culture here was very accounting-driven,” he said. “I’m not knocking accountants, but you need a broader set of skills to really support decision-making at scale.”\n\nHe brought in a new controller, head of FP&A, a procurement lead and a VP of finance to unify the organization and embed it more deeply in go-to-market operations. “FP&A’s role is to be an effective business partner,” Goldstein said. “It’s about using data to help executives make better decisions.”\n\nEvan Goldstein Permission granted by Evan Goldstein\n\nThose decisions include everything from sales capacity modeling and deal structure analysis to headcount forecasting and pricing alignment. “We’ve worked closely with the CRO to structure deals, analyze sales capacity, model headcount and understand what’s driving bookings growth,” Goldstein said.\n\nStafford said the finance team’s integration with sales has made them more than just gatekeepers. “I sell to nobody more than [Goldstein],” Stafford said. “But the way to ‘sell’ a CFO is not to just page in when you need something; that’s the used car salesman mindset. The proper way is relationship selling, establishing trust and building a genuine relationship.”\n\nUpgrading the finance tech stack also played a role in Seismic’s journey to profitability. Goldstein said he implemented Workday Adaptive Planning to help cut forecast turnaround times and introduced Zip to overhaul procurement. “Procurement was the function most on fire when I joined,” he said. “Now it’s seamless, and we’ve seen strong ROI from day one.”\n\nDeveloping alignment where it matters\n\nOne of the most impactful outcomes of the CFO-CRO relationship at Seismic has been a more disciplined approach to revenue operations. This includes commission planning for sales representatives whose deals involve deferred revenue recognition or extended payment terms, where commissions might otherwise be paid well before the company receives the cash. In order to develop this system, both executives say joint ownership is required.\n\nSeismic now uses a standardized commission model, with few exceptions agreed upon by both finance and sales leadership. “Commissions can create a massive waterfall effect if you’re not careful,” Goldstein said.\n\nHayden Stafford Permission granted by Hayden Stafford\n\nThe system was designed collaboratively with sales leadership and built for field alignment and fiscal control. “Evan came in with the law,” Stafford said. “But [Goldstein] is not a ‘no’ CFO. He says no some of the time and yes some of the time. That’s what a good, commercially oriented CFO is like.”\n\n“I think of the CFO and CRO as having two very different lenses,” Stafford added. “The CFO’s world can be black and white — profit, loss, make or miss the plan. The CRO’s can be extremely dynamic and volatile. I’m looking two quarters out. He’s thinking three years out.”\n\nThat difference in horizon often creates tension, but both say that tension is both necessary and productive. “We work hard to resolve issues quickly, keep each other informed and make sure the organization sees that we’re rowing in the same direction,” Goldstein said.\n\nEven during recent market pressure, the company preserved its President’s Club and top-performer rewards, which Stafford said was evidence of Goldstein’s commitment to rewarding sales representatives. “We didn’t cut our top performers' club,” Stafford said. “I never had to defend it. Evan was already and always behind it.”\n\nBuilding for profitability and flexibility\n\nWhile much of Goldstein’s work over the last three years has focused on financial infrastructure, the goal wasn’t just to survive volatility; it was to build a company that could grow on its own terms. “My overarching goal is to create a durable growth company,” he said. “If we build that, the outcome, whether it’s going public, being acquired or taking additional investment, will take care of itself.”\n\n“Sales wants to close deals quickly and more resources in the field. Finance wants predictability, visibility and control. The truth is, you need both.” Evan Goldstein CFO, Seismic\n\nSOX compliance is the last major hurdle before Seismic is IPO-ready, Goldstein said. “That’s a significant investment of time and money,” he said. “But it’s something you can complete in six to 12 months. If we decided to go this year, we could move on it.”\n\nThe long-range planning process brings together Goldstein’s finance and Stafford’s revenue team and requires alignment on long-term strategy with near-term execution. The team refreshes its three-year plan annually, breaks it into quarterly goals and aligns on metrics like rep productivity, customer economics and bookings efficiency.\n\n“Sales wants to close deals quickly and have more resources in the field,” Goldstein said. “Finance wants predictability, visibility and control. The truth is, you need both. That’s why this relationship works.”\n\nFor Goldstein, that balance — between pressure and alignment, growth and discipline — is exactly what defines a successful contemporary CFO. “You want R&D to experiment and try new things,” he said. “But you also need to protect the financial interests of the company. We’ve been able to strike that balance.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:39:33.486916+00:00"}

(NYSE:CRM) Stock's Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Decent: Will The Market Correct The Share Price In The Future?", "summary": "Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has had a rough three months with its share price down 8.8%. However, the company's fundamentals...", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-stocks-110011053.html", "published_at": "2025-08-02T11:00:11Z", "source": "Simply Wall St.", "text": "Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has had a rough three months with its share price down 8.8%. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Salesforce's ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Salesforce is:\n\n10% = US$6.2b ÷ US$61b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2025).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.10 in profit.\n\nView our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Salesforce's Earnings Growth And 10% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Salesforce's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 14%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Salesforce grew its net income at a significant rate of 26% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Salesforce's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 22% in the same period, which is great to see.\n\nNYSE:CRM Past Earnings Growth August 2nd 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is CRM fairly valued?

Currently, several top-tier tech names are trading with forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios under 1 -- something that typically indicates a stock is undervalued relative to its growth. These aren't struggling companies, either. They are leaders in their fields with strong fundamentals, clear catalysts, and solid long-term upside.\n\nHere are five cheap tech stocks worth buying right now.\n\n1. Nvidia (PEG: 0.9)\n\nIt's rare to see the market's top growth stock also sitting in value territory, but that's exactly where Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) finds itself. With a forward PEG of under 0.9 and dominant market share in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, Nvidia remains one of the best long-term bets in tech. Despite the company's massive data center revenue growth over the past two years, there is still plenty of growth in front of the company.\n\nThe real differentiator for Nvidia is CUDA. Nvidia's early bet on building a software ecosystem around its graphics processing units (GPUs) has really paid off. Developers learned to code on CUDA, and tools and libraries were built around it, creating a powerful network effect that is hard to displace. This led the company to capture a staggering 92% share of the GPU market in Q1.\n\nNvidia isn't sitting still, either. The company has a huge automotive opportunity ahead and recently got approval to resume selling its H20 chips in China. The stock trades at a 41 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, but when you're growing revenue at a huge clip and have this kind of moat, the PEG ratio tells the real story.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (PEG: 0.6)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is one of the most important companies involved in the AI infrastructure buildout. And at a forward PEG ratio of just over 0.6, it's also one of the cheapest high-growth stocks in the chip space. TSMC is the AI arms dealer, manufacturing the world's most advanced chips for companies like Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Apple. It doesn't need to bet on a winner -- it manufactures chips for all of them.\n\nTSMC's process node leadership is unmatched. Chips made on 7-nanometer or smaller nodes now make up 74% of revenue, and its 3nm tech already accounted for 24% last quarter. If you plan to make advanced AI chips at scale, you basically need to use TSMC at this point. This has led the company to have strong pricing power as well.\n\nThis could be seen in the company's Q2 results, with revenue surging 44% to $30.1 billion. Geopolitical and tariff risk is real, but TSMC is actively mitigating it with global expansion into the U.S., Japan, and Europe. AI demand continues to explode, and TSMC expects AI-related revenue to grow at a mid-40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028. Trading at a forward P/E of under 25 times and a PEG well below 1, TSMC is a bargain.\n\n3. Alphabet (PEG: 0.8)\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) is a dominant tech company trading like its search business is going away. At 19.5 times forward earnings and a PEG of 0.8, the stock is pricing in more risk than reality. Search isn't dying -- it's evolving, and Alphabet is leading that evolution with AI Overviews, AI Mode, and its Gemini models.\n\nSearch revenue actually accelerated last quarter, growing 12% to $54.2 billion in Q2. Over 2 billion people are now using AI Overviews monthly, and the company says those features are increasing query volume globally. Meanwhile, its cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, is growing like a weed. Revenue jumped 32% to $13.6 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $2.8 billion. The company's tensor processing units are gaining traction, and its Ironwood chip gives it a leg up on inference costs.\n\nAlphabet is also building out its robotaxi business with Waymo, which is now live in multiple U.S. cities, and YouTube continues to deliver. Shorts are driving ad growth, and AI tools like Veo 3 are making content creation easier. It's even a leader in the emerging field of quantum computing with its Willow chip.\n\nAlphabet is still growing earnings and revenue at a double-digit clip and remains one of the most attractively priced AI plays in the market.\n\n4. Alibaba (PEG: 0.5)\n\nAlibaba (BABA 3.30%) is absurdly cheap, trading at just 14 times forward earnings and a PEG ratio around 0.8. That would be interesting on its own, but the company also has nearly 30% of its market cap in net cash and investments. It's a textbook value stock with multiple growth levers in place.\n\nAlibaba's AI story is quietly gaining momentum. Its Cloud Intelligence revenue jumped 18% last quarter, and AI-related revenue has now more than doubled for seven straight quarters. Apple even chose Alibaba's Qwen model to power Apple Intelligence in China, which was a major vote of confidence in its AI technology leadership.\n\nOn the e-commerce front, Alibaba's gross merchandise value is reaccelerating, and it is better monetizing its platform with a small software fee and a new AI marketing tool. Its 88VIP loyalty program is expanding, and one-hour delivery is becoming a meaningful differentiator. The company also expects its international commerce unit to turn profitable soon, which could be a major boost to margins.\n\nAlibaba has a lot of upside as its turnaround continues, but even if it stalls, the stock is so cheap that the downside looks limited.\n\n5. Salesforce (PEG: 0.3)\n\nSalesforce (CRM -0.44%) isn't typically considered a value stock, but perhaps it should be. With a forward P/E around 24 times and a PEG ratio of just 0.3, the stock is a bargain in the software-as-as-service (SaaS) space -- despite having a potential huge growth opportunity with AI agents.\n\nSalesforce's Agentforce platform already has 4,000 paying customers just a few quarters after launch, and the company is working to become the leader in agentic AI. These agents can automate tasks across sales, service, and marketing, which could significantly increase productivity and reduce costs. When combined with its Data Cloud solution -- now generating $1 billion in annual recurring revenue -- the offering becomes even more powerful as Salesforce aims to build a digital workforce.\n\nSalesforce is also rolling out a flexible, outcome-based pricing model for Agentforce to help drive adoption. It's a smart move that aligns costs with value and should help customers see a quick return on their investments. While there's execution risk, the company is already seeing early traction. At this valuation, Salesforce doesn't have to be perfect -- just good. If it hits on agentic AI, the stock could have a lot of upside.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:39:36.944046+00:00"}

The platform supports automation across IT, HR, finance, procurement, legal and support, helping customers drive efficiency and reduce time to value. Momentum in large deals continues to remain strong. ServiceNow closed 89 transactions with more than $1 million in net new annual contract value (ACV), including 11 deals over $5 million. The number of customers contributing over $5 million in ACV rose to 528, up from 508 in the previous quarter. Clients spending over $20 million grew 30% year over year, signaling deeper enterprise commitment. NOW’s expanding portfolio has been a key catalyst. The Core Business Suite, launched in May 2025, brings AI-native capabilities to core business functions. It connects workflows across departments and helps improve execution in areas like procurement and legal. Advancements in AI continue to expand the platform's value. In July, ServiceNow introduced Agentic Workforce Management, designed to support supervised task execution by AI agents across IT and operations. AI agents were also added to Security and Risk offerings through partnerships with Microsoft and Cisco to help accelerate threat detection and automate incident response. For the third quarter of 2025, subscription revenues are projected between $3.26 billion and $3.265 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth in the range of 20%-20.5% on a GAAP basis. At cc, subscription revenues remain flat at 19.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter subscription revenues is pegged at $3.26 billion, up 20.2% year over year, implying sustained enterprise demand.\n\nServiceNow NOW and Salesforce CRM are leading workflow automation platforms, helping enterprises streamline operations through cloud-based software and AI-powered tools. Platforms provided by these companies are widely used by large enterprises to drive efficiency and improve service delivery. Salesforce powers front-office workflows such as lead management, customer service and campaign automation. ServiceNow is known for automating internal workflows across IT service management, employee onboarding and case resolution. With enterprise workflows becoming more complex, demand for automation continues to rise. Per Mordor Intelligence report, the global workflow automation market is valued at $23.77 billion for 2025 and is projected to grow to $37.45 billion by 2030, reflecting a CAGR of 9.52%. Both CRM and NOW are well-positioned to benefit as businesses accelerate the adoption of AI-driven workflow platforms. NOW or CRM — Which of these workflow automation stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Case for Salesforce\n\nSalesforce continues to see broad adoption of its platform as enterprises connect sales, service, marketing and analytics workflows under one system. CRM’s Customer 360 architecture integrates core applications with real-time data and AI, helping enterprises unify engagement and scale digital operations. Acquisitions such as Informatica, Zoomin and Own Company add capabilities in data integration, content automation, and documentation intelligence.\n\n\n\nAdoption remains strong across large enterprise accounts. In the first quarter, more than half of Salesforce’s top 100 deals included six or more clouds. Nearly 60% of those deals featured both Data Cloud and AI, underscoring growing demand for integrated applications with embedded intelligence. Current remaining performance obligations stood at $29.6 billion, up 12% year over year, reflecting continued investment in multi-cloud deployments.\n\n\n\nCRM’s product portfolio remains a key driver. Agent force allows enterprises to deploy AI agents for task execution across sales, service, and marketing. These agents are powered by Data Cloud, which enables real-time data activation across systems. Salesforce has extended its ecosystem through integrations with Snowflake, Databricks, Google BigQuery, and Amazon Redshift to support zero-copy data access and streamline AI workflows.\n\n\n\nSalesforce expects second-quarter sales between $10.11 and $10.16 billion. It now anticipates Subscription and Support revenues to increase approximately 9.5%, up from the previously announced growth rate of 8.5% on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter Subscription and support revenue is pegged at $9.6 billion, up 9.6% year over year. The consensus mark for the second-quarter RPO’s is pegged at $59.84 billion, up 11.8% year over year. Salesforce remains positioned to benefit from rising enterprise demand for unified AI platforms that bring together applications, automation and data on a single foundation.\n\nPrice Performance and Valuation of NOW and CRM\n\nIn the year-to-date period, NOW shares have lost 12.5% and CRM shares have declined 24.2%.\n\nNOW and CRM Stock Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation-wise, NOW and CRM shares are currently overvalued as suggested by a Value Score of F and D, respectively.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, NOW shares are trading at 13.46X, which is higher than CRM’s 5.74X.\n\nNOW and CRM Valuation\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow Do Earnings Estimates Compare for NOW & CRM?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOW’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $16.79 per share, which has increased 1.51% over the past 30 days, indicating an a 20.62% rise year over year.\n\nServiceNow, Inc.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -5.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 6.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.77 per share, indicating a change of +8.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.3 points to a change of +10.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.59 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:39:40.801855+00:00"}

This positions them as essential tools in the modern digital economy.\n\nThe Case for DOCU\n\nDocusign continues to enhance its Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform, strengthening its integration capabilities with enterprise powerhouses like Microsoft MSFT and Salesforce CRM. These collaborations are not just cosmetic; they are core to the company's mission of optimizing agreement workflows and delivering AI-driven insights that improve the end-user experience.\n\nBy embedding itself more deeply into tools already familiar to business clients — such as Microsoft 365 and Salesforce’s CRM suite — Docusign enables seamless agreement management within platforms that enterprises use daily. This integration simplifies contract processes, accelerates decision-making, and creates a unified ecosystem where legal, sales, and procurement teams can collaborate efficiently.\n\nThe IAM platform’s growing synergy also highlights Docusign’s commitment to positioning itself as more than an e-signature solution; it's becoming a comprehensive digital agreement hub. Whether a user is drafting a contract within Microsoft Word or managing client pipelines in Salesforce, Docusign’s IAM helps ensure that documents move swiftly through automated, intelligent workflows.

There’s a lot of scary narratives being planted by executives saying we’re getting big AI layoffs. But the thing about the AI we have—it’s not 100% accurate because it’s built on word models. Without our data set, these models are maybe 50% or 60% accurate. When you add in our data set, we’re getting 90% accuracy, but it’s not 100%. So you need the human in the loop. The humans are not going away. We’re being augmented by these technologies. We’re getting more productivity.\n\nFortune: With these efficiency gains, what is happening to the people who worked in customer support? Are they being transitioned to other roles, or are you shrinking the workforce?\n\nThe second piece is sales. We have so many leads that we can’t follow up on them all. Sales people basically cherry pick what leads they want to call back. Thousands of leads, tens of thousands of leads, hundreds of thousands of leads have never been called back. But in the agentic world, there’s no excuse for that. Every lead can be followed up on.\n\nSupport is a great example. We’ve now done over a million conversations between customers and agents, and at the same time, there’s been about a million conversations between humans and customers. This has only been going on for six to nine months, and we’ve reduced our support cost by 17% so far.\n\nBenioff: I’m looking at every single function and asking: how do we become an agentic enterprise?\n\nNo company has made as big a bet on AI agents as Salesforce . In fact, Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff almost changed the company’s name to “Agentforce” to reflect just how much its future depends on AI doing tasks for workers. And Benioff has not been afraid to eat his own dog…um, drink his own champagne. He calls Salesforce “customer zero” for its own products. AI agents now successfully resolve 85% of Salesforce’s customer service inquiries and qualify its own sales leads 40% faster than before the advent of AI. Overall, Benioff says these AI agents are so effective that they are now doing 30% to 50% of all the work within Salesforce itself. As a result, Benioff has announced that Salesforce won’t be hiring any additional software engineers, customer service agents, or lawyers. But the company is hiring sales people and “customer success” employees. Why? Because it turns out that building AI agents effectively still requires a good deal of learning and support—so Benioff wants to make sure there’s more Salesforce folks out helping customers adopt the AI tech. It’s just one example of why Benioff told Fortune that he doesn’t agree with prominent AI startup CEOs, such as Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, who have predicted AI will result in a huge displacement of white collar workers. Benioff says there will still be plenty of jobs for humans, but exactly what they are may shift. Earlier this month, Fortune sat down with Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff while he was visiting London. What follows is our conversation, edited for length and clarity. Fortune: You’ve said that agents are now doing 30%-50% of work within Salesforce. What does that actually look like internally?\n\nStory Continues\n\nFortune: You mentioned you’re not hiring engineers, support people, or even lawyers this year—only salespeople. What does this mean for younger people trying to enter these fields?\n\nBenioff: We haven’t seen negative impacts play out. I think there are people doing a disservice to the psyche of business by saying things that may not be true. What I’m seeing is a lot more small and medium businesses, a lot more mid-market companies. There’s going to potentially be a lot more employment because everybody is augmented and has the ability to do more.\n\nI think there’s going to be an explosion of small and medium businesses because they can do more, it’s easier to start one, you can create value more easily. We’re definitely seeing this in our business.\n\nFortune: How are you managing the transition internally when people need to move to new positions due to these efficiency gains?\n\nBenioff: I don’t think it’s super complicated. We run something called Trailhead that we make available to customers and employees—you can get trained on all our products. We encourage all employees to do that, get certified, get badges, get trained. That gives them more mobility in the organization.\n\nPeople need to be more flexible in their thinking. We encourage people to have a beginner’s mind. We tell them: with a beginner’s mind, you have every possibility. With an expert’s mind, you have a few. Which one is your choice? We have plenty of options. There’s nothing but opportunity. You can see all the open jobs we post externally and internally.\n\nFortune: There’s concern about AI leading to mass layoffs across the economy. Do you see that happening?\n\nBenioff: I keep looking around, talking to CEOs, asking: what AI are they using for these big layoffs? I think AI augments people, but I don’t know if it necessarily replaces them. Even in radiology departments where AI can read scans, it’s not 100% accurate. The AI can read the scan, but it might get it wrong.\n\nThe reason is because a lot of this is still built on word models. Maybe there’s a future AI model that will be more accurate, but that’s not where we are right now. This is about humans and AI working together. I feel like I have a partner. But it doesn’t always get it right.\n\nFortune: Some worry that companies will create more of their own bespoke software using AI, potentially threatening traditional SaaS companies like Salesforce.\n\nBenioff: It’s always been true that companies can DIY, but only certain companies can. Small and medium companies are not going to DIY because they don’t have big IT departments. But when you’re talking to a company like Barclays with 15,000 engineers, that’s where development teams have always looked at us as a potential competitor.\n\nApps will become more dynamic, where you’ll have the ability to dynamically generate apps. I’m seeing opportunities in that area, but we’re not at that point yet. Nobody can give me an example where someone has dynamically built an enterprise app out of AI. You can define an app in English now, which is exciting, but it’s still going to be built on a platform like ours with the same framework requirements.\n\nFortune: What’s your take on the current state of AI accuracy and capabilities?\n\nBenioff: We need to be more real about what we have. We have this concept of intelligence coming out of these tokens, but it’s not that accurate. Users might have a model help them write a story, summarize it, edit it, translate it to Spanish or Arabic. And they’re like, “Oh, this is cool.” But at the end of the day, you’re still going to have to check it.\n\nEvery AI needs its own fact checker, and those fact checkers are humans, not AIs, because AIs can’t fact check because they don’t have that level of accuracy. The human has to stay in the loop.\n\nFortune: How do you see AI transforming different sectors?\n\nBenioff: In healthcare, we don’t have enough doctors in small towns. There’s a company that spun out of Salesforce called Artera that has FDA certification for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment plans. In our small town [where Benioff lives in Hawaii], we don’t have urologists or oncologists, so this can augment capability. It’s not a substitute for having specialists, but it can help.\n\nIn education, kids are using tools like Grammarly to write papers. But it’s not an excuse for teachers not to look at the Grammarly history to make sure kids are really learning. Education can be augmented, healthcare can be augmented.\n\nBut the burger shop, pizza shop, supermarket, dry cleaner, farmers market—a lot of the core of small towns probably won’t change that much. We’re probably not going to have any robotaxis around. No one’s going to get around to mapping our town for a while. This vision that we were sold that we’re just going to flip a switch and suddenly cars will start driving themselves, it turns out that wasn’t true. And I think that’s a good metaphor for what is going on in the AI industry more broadly. This is about humans and AI working together, not wholesale replacement of human beings.\n\n\n\nFortune: Tell me more about how you see that partnership between human and AI working?\n\nBenioff: I think we are all augmented in our ability to do our jobs. I feel like I have a partner, right? So, for example, every year I sit down to write the Salesforce business plan—and we use this process we call V2MOM [Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measures.] I always sit to do that with a Salesforce executive and now I also work with AI, as a Trinity. And I will say, okay, here’s my whole plan, give me a grade on it. And the AI will say ‘B plus’ But why is it not ‘A’? And it says, ‘Well, you left this out, right? You left that out.’ I’m like, ‘I did leave that out!’ It’s right. It’s very good, actually, at finding things that you’ve left out. So it’s good at finding gaps in your consciousness. I’ve been very impressed with that and it has altered my thinking a couple of times. But it’s you working with the system. AndI think that is a very empowering message for people and for enterprises. This is going to help your employees to be more productive and go forward faster. But it is not a wholesale replacement of human beings. Or if that opportunity exists, somebody needs to explain it to me, because, as the CEO of a 75,000 person company, I can’t figure it out.\n\nFortune: How does this change the way organizations are structured?\n\nBenioff: It allows you to increase your span of control, reduce your layers [of management]. But people keep talking about how robots are going to wholesale replace departments. Where are these robots? Because I don’t see it. Sure, there are some robots out there—we’re going to have some at Dreamforce this year, walking around—but it is going to be very constrained, and it’s going to be somewhat limited, and it’s more about a vision for what’s possible over the long term. But let’s talk about where we are right now. And where we are right now is that every company can be an agentic enterprise but we have to keep the human in the loop.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:40:01.247660+00:00"}

To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Salesforce.com is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nLooking at its valuation, Salesforce.com is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 23.92. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 26.68, so one might conclude that Salesforce.com is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nAlso, we should mention that CRM has a PEG ratio of 1.85. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Software industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.33.\n\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 46, placing it within the top 19% of over 250 industries.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:40:03.438847+00:00"}

We got Freshworks CEO Dennis Woodside. Dennis, great to see you to have you on the show. So you just report results, Dennis. The stock, it's popping about 2% here in the after hours. Walk us through the results, Dennis. What what are you seeing in the business?\n\n00:33 Dennis Woodside\n\nYeah, so Q2 was an outstanding quarter for us. And really the big story for us was AI. We exceeded our expectations on growth and profitability, grew revenue 18% year of a year, cash flow 29%. So really good quarter for us.\n\n01:06 Speaker A\n\nI was talking to an analyst today, Dennis, who covers your company. He was saying, you know what I want to know? I want to know how does Dennis kind of sustain momentum in that division, the EX division where he finds himself competing with the likes of of a service now. What's your answer to that?\n\n01:36 Dennis Woodside\n\nWell, we've been competing with Service Now, Atlassian, uh, Salesforce for years. We're continuing to win business from them. Customers are looking for software that's enterprise grade, AI enabled, scalable, and, uh, doesn't cost as much, lower total cost of ownership, easier to manage. That's what we we offer. Where we're seeing real momentum, though, is in AI. Uh, we have two AI products that we're monetizing. We exceeded $20 million in recurring revenue for those products in the quarter. That's more than doubled year over year. We have 5,000 paying customers for those products. So AI really is the motivator for a lot of sales discussions against those bigger players.\n\n02:42 Speaker A\n\nSpeaking of AI, Dennis, help me think through this. Is it the other division for you all, the CX division? I know there are some questions folks have about whether how potentially disruptive AI could be there. Help me understand that, walk me through it.\n\n03:10 Dennis Woodside\n\nWell, we're seeing, uh, customers on the C, the customer support side of the business using AI to be more efficient in their operations. A good example there is Honda Motors in Europe. They do business in over 30 countries. They can't have a support team that speaks every language. It can't be 24/7. You have to use AI to to manage their interactions with their distributors and their dealers. And they've come to us, they're using our AI to power those interactions. So we view AI on the CX side as a tailwind. Our our AI revenue is roughly equally distributed between EX and CX today.\n\n04:02 Speaker A\n\nYou mentioned some big names you compete with, you know, including service now, Dennis. Are you taking share?\n\n04:17 Dennis Woodside\n\nSo every quarter we're winning business from the likes of Service Now and Atlassian and these bigger players. You know, we have big companies that have come to us, uh, like Seagate, uh, universities. We have over a thousand universities, over a thousand public entities in the US alone. So we continue to take share because customers are looking for a product in particular in that mid-market. Think of a company like New Balance. It has about 5,000 employees. It needs a flexible enterprise grade solution for their IT department, uh, but they don't want the complexity that comes with some of those older legacy solutions, and that's why we're winning.\n\n05:22 Speaker A\n\nI have to ask, Dennis, the stock is in the green here in the after hours, but heading into the report, it is down about 15%, uh, year to date. Do you think, Dennis, there are there are parts of your story that are underappreciated by investors, by the street right here?\n\n05:55 Dennis Woodside\n\nWell, I think the strength of the AI story, the strength of the EX story is a bit underappreciated. You know, we've been racking up quarter over quarter growth for both our AI customer base and our EX business. Over time, you know, the market will recognize that. I'm just thrilled with what we delivered this past quarter where we were able to blow through, you know, the the analyst expectations on both top and bottom line.\n\n06:33 Speaker A\n\nAlways interested, Dennis, here to get lines of sight into the economy based on your business, Dennis, what you see in the business, what you hear from your customers. How would you characterize the US economy right now? You know, the data points we get would seem to suggest a an economy that's that's hanging in there, healthy, resilient, but I'm curious to get your take.\n\n07:01 Dennis Woodside\n\nI, well, look, the demand for what we're seeing is pretty solid. Now, we offer products for both IT and customer support that are must-have products. You got to automate those departments. You got to bring AI into those departments to become more effective and grow faster or reduce costs. So, you know, having a must-have product is a good place to be. Uh, but we saw really steady demand in Q2, very similar to Q1. Uh, second half of the year looks really good.\n\n07:45 Speaker A\n\nFinal question, Dennis. Your tariff, that dynamic, um, in terms of downstream effects, Dennis, you seeing anything there in terms of, you know, smaller deals or taking time to get deals done?\n\n08:03 Dennis Woodside\n\nI mean, virtually none to be honest. You know, our business is pretty diversified. 45% of our revenue is from the US, 55% international. There's no one single industry that dominates our our portfolio. Um, and we saw just continued steady growth, really didn't see any blips from any kind of policy decisions out there.\n\n08:33 Speaker A\n\nDennis, great to have you on the show. Thanks for your time.\n\n08:38 Dennis Woodside\n\nThank you.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:40:05.731770+00:00"}

Vanguard and BlackRock together hold over 15% of the company's shares, and other large asset managers round out a list that reads like some of the most recognized institutional names. These investors aren't chasing headlines they're betting on enterprise resilience and multi-year value creation.\n\nGuidance remains steady, with full-year revenue expected between $41.0 billion and $41.3 billion representing 89% growth and free cash flow expected to grow 910% for FY2026. The company reaffirmed a 34.0% non-GAAP operating margin target, showing that it can grow while staying efficient even while investing heavily in innovation.\n\nImportantly, Data Cloud and AI-related annual recurring revenue has now crossed $1 billion, growing over 120% YoY. Salesforce has closed more than 8,000 deals tied to Agentforce, its AI agent platform half of which are already paid. While still early, the scale suggests real room to generate revenue down the line.\n\nStrong cash flow continues to be a highlight. Operating cash flow reached $6.5 billion for the quarter, a 4% increase YoY, and free cash flow followed closely at $6.3 billion. This allowed Salesforce to return $3.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends showing greater focus on managing capital responsibly.\n\nSalesforce's Q1 FY2026 results reflected steady performance and a clear plan. Revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $9.8 billion, with subscription and support revenue its most stable segment rising 8% as well. While the topline growth is modest, it's being delivered alongside healthy margins: GAAP operating margin came in at 19.8%, with a robust non-GAAP margin of 32.3%.\n\nThe truth lies somewhere in the second camp. Salesforce is quietly handling its strategy effectively: streamlining how it manages expenses, expanding its recurring revenue base, and investing heavily in AI systems. The numbers suggest a business in transition not decline and that disconnect may be offering patient investors a compelling setup.\n\nSalesforce has long been a major player in business software solutions but the market isn't treating it like one. Despite strong margins, rising cash flow, and a more developed approach to AI-powered tools, the company is valued lower than several similar companies. This has raised doubts about whether Salesforce has already peaked or whether investors are simply overlooking the company's ongoing progress.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, insider ownership has remained stable. While modest in percentage terms, CEO Marc Benioff continues to hold a significant stake, aligning executive interests with shareholders. The absence of activist pressure or high-frequency turnover in ownership further supports the notion that Salesforce is viewed as a strategic long-term hold not a tactical trade.\n\nSalesforce Stock Outlook: A Strong Business at a Discounted Price\n\nValuation Comparison: Salesforce Trades at a Discount to Peers\n\nDespite its scale and profitability, Salesforce trades at noticeably lower valuation multiples than its peers:\n\nCompany P/E Ratio P/S Ratio EV/EBITDA Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) 27 6.6 19.4 Intuit (INTU) 33 9.8 24.3 Adobe (ADBE) 39 10.5 27.5 HubSpot (HUBS) N/A (negative) 11.2 N/A (negative)\n\nSalesforce is generating cash flow and earnings while trading at valuations more commonly assigned to slower-growth, low-margin businesses. Its EV/EBITDA ratio of ~19.7x is nearly half that of Adobe and Intuit despite similar or superior margin performance and greater product breadth.\n\nThis pricing difference is tough to explain given Salesforce's scale, profitability, and growing AI monetization. If anything, Salesforce's mature margins should support a higher multiple particularly when peers like HubSpot are still losing money yet trade at much richer revenue multiples. The market seems to be penalizing Salesforce not for poor performance, but for its less straightforward story for investors.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: How Peer Strategies Threaten Salesforce's Position\n\nSalesforce dominates CRM, but its competitors are no longer playing catch-up they're reshaping expectations. And while none are direct replacements, each introduces specific pressures that could weigh on Salesforce's ability to justify a higher multiple.\n\nHubSpot is growing revenue at over 20% year-over-year, with net revenue retention above 110% and increasing adoption in the mid-market enterprise. Its product-led model allows for efficient customer acquisition and expansion, which contrasts sharply with Salesforce's high-touch sales engine. As HubSpot pushes upmarket with easier integrations and better UI, it could erode Salesforce's growth narrative in smaller teams and fast-scaling startups segments that feed into long-term enterprise deals.\n\nIntuit has kept operating margins near 30% while expanding its product stack across personal finance, small business accounting, and marketing. That breadth is starting to touch areas where Salesforce has historically held influence especially in SMBs and financial services. Intuit's growth is not about being everything to everyone; it's about deepening wallet share in focused verticals.\n\nAdobe, through its Experience Cloud, is gaining ground among CMOs looking for end-to-end campaign management. In Q1 alone, Adobe's Digital Experience segment grew mid-teens, and its integration with Creative Cloud makes it hard to dislodge. For Salesforce, this means increased pricing pressure and more friction in marketing tech deals particularly among customers who don't want to manage fragmented ecosystems.\n\nIf Salesforce can't clearly demonstrate that its cross-cloud architecture drives superior outcomes, it may struggle to escape the complex incumbent label. That perception not only shapes customer decisions but also market pricing.\n\nSalesforce Stock Outlook: A Strong Business at a Discounted Price\n\nRisk Factors: Key Challenges Facing Salesforce's Valuation Rebound\n\nWhile Salesforce looks cheaper compared to similar companies, that lower valuation shows that investors have real doubts about Salesforce's ability to deliver not just sentiment. The company's effort to expand into AI through products like Agentforce and Data Cloud, is promising but just getting started. Despite the volume of AI-related deals closed, only half are paid, and the overall impact hasn't had a major effect on revenue yet. Management has signaled that meaningful contribution from these initiatives may not materialize until FY2027.\n\nMoreover, the company's traditional growth engines the Sales and Service Clouds are showing signs of fatigue, both posting mid-to-high single-digit growth rates. Even with a solid ability to manage costs and maintain profit levels, a decelerating core makes it harder to justify a higher stock valuation.\n\nCompetitors are embedding AI more deeply and quickly into their platforms. Rivals like Microsoft and Oracle offer bundled AI functionality at scale, while Salesforce is still in the early stages of turning its tools into meaningful revenue. Additionally, Slack's AI integration restrictions may alienate users, hindering adoption of Agentforce.\n\nMacroeconomic factors, cautious IT spending, high interest rates, and regulatory scrutiny over data also present headwinds, especially for large platform vendors. Lastly, the pending acquisition of Informatica adds the chance that combining operations might not go smoothly that could distract from core execution at a critical moment.\n\nEach of these risks strikes at the core of the thesis: Salesforce must prove that it can grow into more profitable AI-focused areas without letting costs get out of hand. That balance will ultimately determine whether the current valuation is a floor or a ceiling.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSalesforce is not broken but it is mispriced. The company is executing at scale, sustaining high margins, and returning billions to shareholders, yet the market continues to discount its value. Why? Because the story has become harder to follow. While competitors like Intuit and Adobe are rewarded for clear, focused narratives, Salesforce is caught between reinvention and execution, with AI promises still waiting for proof.\n\nThat's precisely where the opportunity lies. Salesforce today trades at a multiple more typical of mature software but it's investing like a growth company. If even a portion of its AI strategy pays off, or if the Informatica acquisition accelerates data unification across its clouds, the market will have to reassess the company's trajectory and, with it, its valuation. On the other hand, even if AI monetization is slower than hoped, Salesforce still throws off cash and maintains best-in-class operating leverage.\n\nIn short, this is a stock trading like a middle-of-the-road stock but with room to surprise. Investors willing to look past the complexity and trust in the fundamentals may find themselves holding a business that's not just undervalued but tactically overlooked by many investors.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:40:09.583739+00:00"}

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does Salesforce Carry?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Salesforce had US$8.44b of debt in April 2025, down from US$9.43b, one year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$17.4b in cash, so it actually has US$8.97b net cash.\n\nNYSE:CRM Debt to Equity History July 29th 2025\n\nHow Healthy Is Salesforce's Balance Sheet?\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Salesforce had liabilities of US$24.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$13.7b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$17.4b in cash and US$4.35b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$16.2b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nGiven Salesforce has a humongous market capitalization of US$257.3b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Salesforce boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nSee our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nAlso positive, Salesforce grew its EBIT by 20% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Salesforce's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.

They’re on X, they’re in the White House, and they’re constantly chasing press coverage of Series A deals into B2B SaaS companies that might become the next Salesforce, but could just as likely fold in a few years.\n\nToday’s VCs hold an inordinate amount of cultural capital, and for good reason: They fund many of the companies that undergird not only our economy, but our social fabric, and they are often instrumental in shaping tomorrow’s trends. But still, they represent a small fraction of the broader investment landscape, which is why I’m always astounded by the sheer scale of the private equity industry.\n\nI spent the past few months reporting on Ares Management, an alternative asset manager that spun out of Apollo in the late 1990s. Originally, I was interested in the firm because of its role in the booming field of private credit, which has become such a buzzword that it seems like high finance’s equivalent of AI (and they’re related, with much of new private credit capital going to fund data centers).\n\nAres’ bread and butter business is lending to other alternative assets firms like KKR and Apollo, raising money to help fund their buyouts of middle market companies that most venture firms would never be interested in (though that’s changing), and occasionally taking small equity stakes themselves. The strategy has paid off, especially with the rise of private equity more broadly after the 2008 financial crisis, with Ares now aiming to grow its assets under management to $750 billion by 2028. Compare that to Insight Partners, one of the larger venture players dabbling in private equity, which has $90 billion.\n\nAs with tokenization, private credit is taking on an increasingly greater role in our economy as companies take longer to go public or decide never to go public at all. Rather than turning to public markets for funding, they must look to other means, with firms like Ares waiting in the wings.\n\nFor everyday investors, that limits the type of companies where they can put their money—though some firms like Apollo are starting to offer vehicles like ETFs, as well as tokenized funds, that provide access to private companies.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAs Riveron CFO Tony Ciotti sees it, the lines between financial teams and operations teams are rapidly blurring. In some cases, he says, they’re “just nonexistent.”\n\nConsider the rise of the chief operating and finance officer, or COFO. Salesforce and Qualcomm are among the latest big companies to appoint individuals to this hybrid role. Though Ciotti is not one himself, he predicts it’s a trend that will continue in the years ahead.\n\nCiotti came into his role as CFO of Riveron after years in operations at firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Grant Thornton. He first joined the latter as operations director back in September 2013.\n\nJust about a decade later, he followed Grant Thornton’s former CFO Sam Shaw over to Riveron, where Shaw now serves as chief executive.\n\nIn an interview with CFO.com, Ciotti talks through why he believes finance and operations will continue to meld, how he approaches leadership under private equity and what he’s learned from financial crises over the years.\n\nTony Ciotti\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Riveron\n\nCFO, Riveron\n\nFirst CFO position: November 2023\n\nNotable previous employers:\n\nGrant Thornton\n\nPwC\n\nAccenture\n\nThis conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nDAN NIEPOW: You’ve spent a lot of your career so far working in operations roles. What led you to turn to the financial side of things and to becoming a CFO specifically?\n\nTONY CIOTTI: I followed a less-than-traditional path to CFO. But I would also say, candidly, that the definition of a “traditional path” is changing by the day. I see and hear this all the time among my CFO brethren. I am not hearing or seeing the CPA-required, compliance-oriented mindset of the past. We are seeing more and more operators in these roles.\n\nMy experience in operations has set me up for success, as much as my experience in finance has. In my mind, it's all about having the ability to span across different functions in an organization while maintaining a strong financial perspective. And as part of the operations team, I've led resource management functions, recruiting functions, marketing, sales, IT functions. It makes me more than just the numbers guy who's prescribing something to you.\n\nAs for Riveron specifically, I was attracted to the company’s mission and team. The firm is full of people who’ve sat in the CFO seat for private equity companies, for portfolio companies, for publicly traded companies and privately held companies. It’s been a great way to dive into my first CFO role.\n\nWhat do you think finance teams can learn from operations teams?\n\nIn today’s companies, there’s so much overlap between finance and ops. I think the lines can essentially be blurred, or, in many cases, nonexistent. As I came up through prior firms, we consistently relied on financial-operator types — people who sat in between the business, supporting day-to-day operations and supporting the finance function. They were squarely in between, straddling that fence.\n\nI’d also say operators, at times, have a broader purview and perspective. It’s a powerful position to consider, particularly when you parlay that with financial literacy. Then you've got someone who has done the job that the practice trusts, but that the finance function and accounting function know and trust as well. That’s a great example of where these lines start to blur.\n\nWe’re seeing more and more companies appointing COFOs — chief operating and financial officers. Given your history, what’s your take on this trend? Do you expect this to be something we’ll continue to see?\n\nAbsolutely, I expect it to continue on steroids. We see this every day with our client base at Riveron. These two roles often go hand in hand or get blended into a single role. We’re also seeing the aperture for CFOs being broadened tremendously. We're expected to be much more than a cost center or a financial voice of the firm. We have to do more than deliver the financial news.\n\n“In today’s companies, there’s so much overlap between finance and ops. I think the lines can essentially be blurred, or, in many cases, nonexistent.” Tony Ciotti CFO, Riveron\n\nIn my case, for example, I'm in the boardroom all the time. I’m not just talking about what happened, but also about what will happen and why, and what I’m doing about it. We've become strategy enablers. Yes, there's still the compliance lean to it.\n\nWe’re also responsible for driving growth and profitability. And yet, in my world, I’m seeing regulatory, tax compliance and the more traditional focus of the past gradually landing with highly capable controllers and accounting teams. I've been fortunate enough to have some rockstar controllers who’ve enabled me to step up and focus on bigger picture things. That’s also enabling many other modern CFOs to focus on strategic priorities in tandem with the CEO and in tandem. And that's where I see that blended COFO role being very powerful.\n\nRiveron was acquired by private equity firm Kohlberg & Co. about two years ago. Can you talk a bit about what it’s like leading a private equity-owned company?\n\nWe were owned by H.I.G. Capital before the Kohlberg deal, so we’re very familiar with private equity. I would say the goals remain the same, regardless of ownership structure: deliver exceptional client service, drive high growth, take market share and scale.\n\nIn Kohlberg, we have a financial sponsor who has strong conviction in their investment thesis, and they've opened up a lot of growth opportunities for us. Like any portfolio company, we move at a very fast pace. We are aggressive in our pursuit of growth, but we also know when to quickly call the ball and pivot when something isn't working.\n\n“Use today’s headwinds as a catalyst for change. Maybe that means evaluating opportunities now for the incorporation of things like artificial intelligence or other emerging tech. The truth is, the more you wait, the more behind you’ll be.” Tony Ciotti CFO, Riveron\n\nAnd we still maintain a “think like an owner” mindset. It allows us to drive value in the short and long term. We also serve plenty of private equity clients; we like to say we’re built by PE, for PE. We understand the expectations of sponsors and the needs of portfolio companies. We speak the language.\n\nThe announcement about your acquisition noted that a “a significant percentage of Riveron’s employee base will also be equity owners in the company.” Can you talk a bit about that dynamic? Is Riveron still partly employee-owned, then?\n\nIt is. It’s a great structure, and a great feather in our cap. We encourage our employees to directly participate in the value creation opportunity under Kohlberg’s hold. Once they reach a certain level, employees have the option to purchase common equity in the firm, subject to investment caps.\n\nToday, hundreds of our 1,200 employees sit on the cap table. They've invested their own money in the firm, and their collective equity position in the firm is sizable. I mentioned “thinking like an owner” in response to your last question; there's no better way to drive employees to think like an owner than to be one. For us, it’s been a hugely motivating differentiator at Riveron. Nearly everyone eligible to participate does.\n\nOn your LinkedIn page, you said you have “specific expertise in helping firms ‘survive and thrive’ in times of financial crisis.” What would you say are the most important elements for companies to keep in mind during a financial crisis or downturn?\n\nIf you look back at any of the recent crises — whether that’s the Great Recession, COVID-19 or even this current cycle — there are consistent themes that emerge and opportunities that arise. That’s my starting point mentality: Where’s the opportunity in this climate? I try to see today’s uncertainty as tomorrow’s opportunity. Use today’s headwinds as a catalyst for change. Maybe that means evaluating opportunities now for the incorporation of things like artificial intelligence or other emerging tech. The truth is, the more you wait, the more behind you’ll be.\n\nI say that with confidence because these changes are coming, agnostic of whatever the economy looks like in six months or a year. Take the time to sharpen your pencil on things like forecasting, managing P&L and cash flow. You need to understand where precious capital can and should be deployed.\n\nI would advise businesses not to sit on the sidelines. And for those businesses that are challenged with top-line growth or stagnancy, I’d emphasize that you can’t cut your way to prosperity either. Yes, you’ve got to manage profitability. But the challenge is finding creative ways to make investments even during hard times.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:40:19.608203+00:00"}

Let’s examine their fundamentals, growth drivers and valuations.\n\nThe Case for UiPath\n\nUiPath remains a strong force in the booming RPA market, which is poised for substantial expansion over the coming years. Its end-to-end automation platform positions the company to seize opportunities as demand for AI-driven solutions surges.\n\nA critical driver of PATH’s success is its strategic alliances with top technology giants. Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Salesforce CRM continue to play pivotal roles in expanding UiPath’s reach and capabilities. These partnerships not only bolster PATH’s credibility but also integrate its offerings into broader enterprise ecosystems powered by Microsoft Azure, Amazon’s AWS and Salesforce Cloud solutions.\n\nThe company boasts high customer retention, with net retention rates ranging between 110% and 115%, underscoring its ability to expand usage within existing accounts. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, UiPath reported a 6% increase in revenues year over year, reaching $357 million. Additionally, its annual recurring revenue rose 12% to $1.69 billion, reflecting the strength of its subscription-based business model and customer loyalty.\n\nWith a strong global presence, a robust partner ecosystem, particularly with Microsoft, Amazon, and Salesforce, and a continued focus on intelligent automation, UiPath is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the evolving RPA and enterprise automation market.\n\nThe Case for AppLovin\n\nAppLovin has solidified its leadership in mobile advertising, powered by its next-gen AI engine, Axon 2, which launched in the second quarter of 2023.

In a post-Identifier for Advertisers environment that disrupted mobile user acquisition strategies, Axon 2 served as a critical catalyst for recovery. While Western mobile gaming experienced stagnation in 2022, Axon 2 reignited ad-driven momentum.

We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Salesforce. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong.

Furthermore, CEO Marc Benioff is the owner of 2.3% of the company's shares.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:40:31.208806+00:00"}

Since its launch in the second quarter of 2023, Axon 2 has redefined AppLovin’s ad platform, triggering a massive surge in activity. Advertising spends on the platform have since quadrupled, with gaming clients alone contributing to a $10 billion annual run rate. This scale firmly positions AppLovin among the most valuable ad tech companies globally.\n\nReshaping Mobile Advertising in the Post-IDFA Era\n\nAxon 2’s impact reaches far beyond traditional performance metrics. In a mobile ecosystem still adjusting to the limitations imposed by Apple’s IDFA changes, AppLovin has managed to turn disruption into opportunity. Axon 2 became a pivotal tool in helping marketers navigate this new environment, enabling efficient user acquisition strategies that had previously been compromised.\n\nAs the Western mobile gaming market stagnated in 2022, AppLovin leveraged Axon 2 to reignite growth. While overall in-app purchase revenues across the industry are expanding at a modest mid-single-digit annual pace, publishers using AppLovin’s MAX platform are seeing growth rates many times higher, thanks to the improved efficiency and targeting capabilities enabled by Axon 2.\n\nFinancial Results Underscore Momentum\n\nAppLovin’s financial performance reflects the effectiveness of its AI-driven strategy. In the first quarter of 2025, revenues rose by 40% year over year, adjusted EBITDA increased by 83% and net income climbed an extraordinary 144%. These trends were consistent throughout 2024, when the company reported a 43% increase in annual revenue and an 81% surge in adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThese figures do more than indicate strong operational execution; they point to a business that is undergoing a structural shift in profitability, with Axon 2 at the center of that transformation.\n\nA Different Kind of AI Strategy\n\nWhile major technology firms such as Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, and Salesforce CRM are rapidly expanding their generative AI offerings in productivity and enterprise software, AppLovin is pursuing a fundamentally different strategy.

This move marks a significant step toward full platform independence, allowing Veeva to operate entirely on its proprietary Vault architecture. The strategy is designed to give Veeva greater control over product development, performance, and long-term innovation — especially as the company deepens its focus on delivering purpose-built software for the life sciences sector. Early signs are promising, with many clients already reporting smoother integration and more consistent performance on Vault.\n\nVeeva’s recent performance shows just how central the Vault platform has become to its long-term growth story. Veeva has also been proactive in helping its Commercial Cloud customers prepare for the shift, offering migration roadmaps and hands-on support to ease the transition. While increased investment in R&D and customer onboarding may weigh on margins in the short term, Veeva appears focused on the bigger picture, owning its infrastructure to drive faster innovation and long-term differentiation in a highly specialized market.\n\nPeers Update\n\nFor Salesforce CRM, the conclusion of its infrastructure partnership with Veeva marks a natural evolution as both companies refine their long-term strategies. While Veeva was a high-profile example of Salesforce’s presence in life sciences, its shift reflects a broader industry trend toward purpose-built platforms. Salesforce continues to expand its healthcare and life sciences offerings through initiatives like Health Cloud and Data Cloud, aiming to meet the growing demand for tailored solutions. Although adoption varies across segments, Salesforce remains a key player with a broad enterprise footprint and a strong innovation pipeline.\n\nIQVIA IQV, a major player in the life sciences technology space, continues to compete through its deep data assets and broad service offerings. While its technology stack is not as tightly integrated as Veeva’s, IQVIA’s scale and diversified model give it a different kind of competitive edge.

This strategic decision marks the beginning of Veeva’s transition to its proprietary Vault platform, signaling a decisive move toward platform independence and deeper industry specialization.\n\nThe split sets up a compelling faceoff between two companies now heading down very different paths. Veeva is sharpening its focus on life sciences by building vertically integrated solutions tailored to the sector’s needs. At the same time, Salesforce is making a deliberate push into life sciences with its own purpose-built CRM offering. Both companies are accelerating investments in AI and product innovation, but their visions for capturing long-term growth are rapidly diverging.

This move is more than just a tech transition. It gives Veeva full control over its software stack, allowing it to tailor features, optimize performance, and potentially expand margins without depending on a third-party host. More importantly, it strengthens Veeva’s position as a vertically integrated player with deep regulatory and workflow understanding, something horizontal platforms often struggle to replicate in niche markets.\n\nSalesforce, meanwhile, brings the power of a highly adaptable and proven CRM infrastructure that serves thousands of enterprise customers across industries. Its recent push into life sciences through the introduction of a dedicated Life Sciences Cloud reflects a strategic intent to expand within this high-value vertical. While its approach is broader by design, Salesforce benefits from scale, flexibility, and a robust ecosystem that supports rapid customization through its platform tools.

The company started the year by announcing one of its biggest partnerships with Apple to support iPhones’ AI services offering in China, which sent BABA’s shares to a three-year high. The announcement came at a critical time, with Alibaba facing stiff competition from DeepSeek in China’s AI market.\n\n\n\nBABA is not slowing down and expanding its AI footprint rapidly. It recently formed a strategic partnership with smartphone maker HONOR, which marked the first time for Alibaba’s proprietary AI agents to be directly integrated into mobile devices. The company’s first hybrid reasoning family Qwen3 is gaining rapid traction, with companies, such as NVIDIA, AMD and MediaTek deploying Qwen3 on their frameworks.\n\n\n\nAlibaba also announced that it will invest more than $60 million in the next fiscal year to strengthen its partner ecosystem and accelerate AI innovation. The investment is underscored by new and expanded partnerships with leading technology providers worldwide. They include Dify, Squirro, PingCAP, Atos, Crayon, DXC Technology, Bespin Global Indonesia and Electrum Cloud. The investment will go toward collaborative marketing campaigns, incentive rebate programs and other activities to benefit both Alibaba Cloud and its partners.

Over the years, Salesforce has built a strong and interconnected platform. The acquisition of Informatica, Zoomin and Own Company shows its intent to move beyond its position as a CRM software maker and become a broader enterprise software provider focused on artificial intelligence (AI), data and collaboration.\n\nAI is now central to Salesforce’s growth plan. Since rolling out Einstein GPT in 2023, the company has embedded generative AI into its platform to help businesses automate processes, improve decisions and offer better customer experiences. As AI adoption rises across industries, Salesforce is well-placed to benefit from the same.\n\nIts latest innovation, Agentforce, reflects that momentum. Paired with its Data Cloud, Agentforce has already hit $100 million in annualized revenues just two quarters after launch. More than 4,000 customers are using it for various tasks in sales, service and marketing. Data Cloud is also expanding fast, with annual recurring revenues growing more than 120% year over year. Salesforce’s broader strategy of bringing apps, data and AI agents under one umbrella gives it a strong edge.\n\nHowever, Salesforce’s biggest challenge right now is slowing sales growth. For years, the company has delivered double-digit revenue increases. However, that pace has now cooled to single digits. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues rose just 7.7% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew by only 5.7%.\n\nThis slowdown reflects cautious enterprise spending amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical pressures.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 7.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.77 per share, indicating a change of +8.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.3 points to a change of +10.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.59 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:40:56.498661+00:00"}

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nHow Fast Is Salesforce Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nSalesforce has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Salesforce boosted its trailing twelve month EPS from US$5.63 to US$6.49, in the last year. That's a 15% gain; respectable growth in the broader scheme of things.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Salesforce is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.1 percentage points to 21%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$6.4b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nShould You Add Salesforce To Your Watchlist?\n\nAs previously touched on, Salesforce is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Salesforce is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:40:58.521843+00:00"}

However, the second half could be very different.\n\nLet's look at five stocks that were AI losers in the first half of 2025 that look poised to rebound in the second half.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) continues to be one of the most misunderstood stocks in the market. Investors keep worrying about AI disrupting its core search business, but that misses the bigger picture. Google isn't a search company -- it's a content discovery platform with a huge distribution advantage and decades of behavioral data behind it.\n\nAlphabet's browser and mobile operating system give it an enormous edge. Chrome commands more than 65% of global browser share, while Android runs on over 70% of smartphones. Meanwhile, Google has revenue-sharing deals to be the default search engine across Apple devices and other browsers. As search and AI evolve, that distribution becomes increasingly important.\n\nAt the same time, Google has stepped up its game with its new AI-powered Search Mode. In a recent Oppenheimer survey, 82% of users found it more helpful than traditional search, and 75% preferred it to ChatGPT. Importantly, Google doesn't need to change user behavior and have people switch over to its apps. Its billions of users just need to click AI Mode to get this experience.\n\nIts cloud computing business is also gaining traction. Google Cloud revenue rose 28% last quarter, and the company is investing heavily to build capacity to keep up with demand. Add in under-appreciated assets like its Waymo robotaxi business and its Willow quantum chip, and Alphabet looks ready to rebound in the back half.\n\nGitLab\n\nAnother company that is misunderstood is GitLab (GTLB 1.24%). Investors are worried that with AI, organizations are going to need fewer coders. However, thus far AI has led to more software development, while GitLab has quietly been transforming itself into a software development lifecycle platform.\n\nThe company took a big step forward in this direction with the release of GitLab 18. It added over 30 new features, including its Duo Agent Platform, which allows users to deploy AI agents across the entire development cycle from code generation to testing to compliance. This is important, as according to William Blair, developers only spend about 20% of their time actually writing code.\n\nThe company has already been growing revenue at a strong clip, including 27% last quarter. The growth is being driven by new customers as well as existing customers buying more seats and upgrading tiers. GitLab has also been expanding key partnerships, including with Amazon.\n\nAs a company that is helping drive end-to-end development workflow efficiency, GitLab has a strong future ahead and looks like a solid rebound candidate.\n\nSalesforce\n\nSalesforce (CRM -0.44%) has spent the last year refocusing its platform around AI. Its new Agentforce platform has over 4,000 paying customers already, and it's at the center of what could become a much bigger digital labor platform.\n\nThe company's strategy is to unify apps, data, automation, and metadata to a single framework called ADAM. It will then use this as a foundation to build and scale AI agents, helping create a digital workforce. It also recently rolled out a more flexible pricing model tied to outcomes to help increase adoption.\n\nSalesforce is already the leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software, and its push into AI agents could be a huge growth driver. With the stock lagging in the first half, it could rebound if Agentforce starts to gain more traction.\n\nServiceNow\n\nServiceNow (NOW -0.38%) may not be an obvious AI name, but it's also using AI to help transform its business. The company's roots are in IT management, but it has since expanded into human resources, finance, and customer service.\n\nThe company's strength has always been connecting siloed departments and helping organizations streamline their operations. It has embedded AI into its Now Platform, helping take these efforts to the next level. It's been seeing strong traction, with AI-driven Pro Plus deals quadrupling year over year last quarter. As organizations increasingly focus on efficiency and automation to help reduce costs, ServiceNow is well-positioned.\n\nWhile some investors worry about enterprise software budgets, ServiceNow is a cost-saving platform that should continue to perform well in the current environment. That should help set the stock up to rebound later this year.\n\nSentinelOne\n\nSentinelOne's (S 3.10%) stock was under pressure in the first half of the year, but there's a good reason to believe that it will perform much better in the second half. The big reason is that its new partnership with Lenovo is about to ramp up.\n\nLenovo is the world's largest enterprise PC vendor, and starting in the second half, it will pre-install SentinelOne's Singularity Platform on all new computers it sells. Existing Lenovo users will also be able to upgrade to SentinelOne's AI-powered security platform. That's a huge opportunity for the cybersecurity company.\n\nSentinelOne has already been seeing solid revenue growth, including 23% last quarter. While it's not the leader in the endpoint security space -- that would be CrowdStrike -- its platform receives high marks from Gartner. Meanwhile, its Purple AI solution, which helps analysts hunt complex security threats through the use of natural language prompts, has been the fastest-growing solution in its history.\n\nAll in all, SentinelOne is a solid company whose stock trades at a big discount to some of its bigger peers. Meanwhile, the Lenovo deal should be a catalyst in the second half.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:41:01.651420+00:00"}

Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) experienced a significant rise over the past few years and is now the 24th largest company by market capitalization globally.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/20/prediction-3-stocks-that-will-be-worth-more-than-p/", "published_at": "2025-07-20T10:00:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Palantir Technologies (PLTR 2.30%) experienced a significant rise over the past few years and is now the 24th largest company by market capitalization globally. However, through a combination of factors, I think there could be multiple stocks that pass Palantir over the coming years.\n\nThree that I think have that chance are ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%), International Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), and Salesforce (CRM -0.44%), but this list could grow if the market comes to its senses regarding Palantir's stock.\n\nPalantir's stock appears to be significantly overvalued\n\nPalantir has been on an absolute tear since the start of 2024, rising nearly 800%. However, its revenue only grew 39% year over year in the first quarter, indicating a significant disparity between stock price appreciation and actual business growth.\n\nThis shows up in the stock's valuation, which trades for 113 times sales and 244 times forward earnings.\n\nVery few companies ever reach this valuation for good reason: It's nearly impossible to live up to expectations. If we use a five-year timeline to examine Palantir's stock, let's make the following assumptions:\n\nRevenue growth of 40%.\n\nProfit margin reaches 30%.\n\nShare count remains flat.\n\nThose are three incredibly bullish assumptions -- the company hasn't achieved 40% year-over-year growth in recent quarters and would have to sustain that for five years. Also, a 30% profit margin would place it among the best software companies, and its current 18% margin is still a considerable distance from that level.\n\nLastly, management is notorious for issuing a large number of shares to employees, and its share count has increased by 7.3% since the start of 2024, indicating significant dilution.\n\nRegardless, if these heady assumptions could come true, Palantir would generate $16.8 billion in revenue and $5 billion in profits. That's huge growth from today's $3.1 billion in revenue, but it would still value the company at 67 times hypothetical 2030 earnings.\n\nA 67 multiple for forward earnings makes for a very expensive stock, and Nvidia, which is consistently growing faster than Palantir, has only a 38 forward earnings multiple right now.\n\nI think this is a fairly clear-cut case that Palantir is drastically overvalued at today's levels. Even with the most bullish assumptions, Palantir's stock would still appear overvalued five years from now, even if the company achieves incredible growth figures.\n\nAs a result, I believe the stock is ripe for a decline, and there are many other stocks (beyond the ones I mentioned) that could surpass Palantir.\n\nThis trio has a strong outlook and significantly cheaper prices\n\nASML is only slightly behind Palantir's $362 billion market cap, with a valuation of $292 billion at the time of this writing. It is a key provider of machinery in chip manufacturing, and it holds a technological monopoly with its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines.\n\nAs more chip fabrication facilities emerge to support the huge AI demand, the company will experience strong growth, which management has told investors to expect in 2026. As a result, I think ASML could easily surpass Palantir.\n\nIBM is a legacy computing business that's working to make the pivot into AI and quantum computing, which is forecast to see commercial adoption around 2030. If it becomes the go-to for this technology, the stock could be ripe for huge upside from its current $266 billion valuation.\n\nLastly, Salesforce dominates in customer relationship management software. It's also working to integrate AI into its product and maximize its profitability. Compared to many stocks on the market, it is relatively cheap and is valued at a lower level than the S&P 500, which trades for 23.7 times forward earnings.\n\nAs a final note, all three of these stocks trade for far less than Palantir's hypothetical 2030 valuation, which should be a sign for investors that the stock is unsustainably expensive. There is a near-endless list of stocks that appear to be better investments, and these three are among them.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:41:03.666040+00:00"}

What's going on?\n\nThis fiscal year, Salesforce is anticipating 7% to 8% revenue growth -- its first single-digit annual growth rate in years. In past years, it has managed consistent 20% to 30% annual growth rates. Analysts are concerned that the company's best days are behind it. As an analyst at Bernstein Research concludes, \"We have been concerned that Salesforce was a mature business in a mature market and that expectations were running too high in general.\n\nUnitedHealth stock is down 40%\n\nIt's been a very rough year for UnitedHealth Group (UNH 3.63%).

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Salesforce.com (CRM).\n\nSalesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.56, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 50 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.56 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 50 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 37 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 74% and 4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CRM\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRM\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Salesforce.com here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Salesforce.com, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:41:12.854697+00:00"}

Over the past three years AI has dominated the conversation on Wall Street regarding how it holds the potential to transform businesses, create new opportunities, and drive earnings growth for numerous industries.\n\nIndeed, some of the biggest businesses in the world have been driven higher as their earnings explode amid the push for AI dominance. Nvidia is the poster child for AI stocks, climbing an eye-popping 1,330% from October 2022 to today and surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization.\n\nAs many of the most popular AI stocks have soared higher, a lot of them now look fairly pricey these days from a valuation standpoint. An investor just starting out with $300 will want to ensure they're buying a great company at a fair price, and those are getting harder and harder to find in the AI space.\n\nBut there are still a few good opportunities out there if you're willing to do the work. Here are three stocks, all with share prices below $300, that can help you get started.\n\n1. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce (CRM -0.44%) is best known for its growing suite of enterprise software, which covers everything from its original sales vertical to customer service. The company has been working to integrate AI capabilities with all of its software, but its biggest development over the past year is Agentforce.\n\nAgentforce is built on top of Salesforce's Data Cloud software, which helps aggregate all of the data generated by a business into a single unified source. With Agentforce, customers can create AI agents that can tap into that data to make informed decisions and complete low-level tasks. Salesforce sees enterprises using Agentforce as part of their customer service and sales teams and internally for research or teaching new skills to employees.\n\nSalesforce had 8,000 Agentforce contracts as of the end of the first quarter, generating over $100 million in annual recurring revenue after just two full quarters of sales. CEO Marc Benioff says it's the fastest Salesforce product to reach that milestone.\n\nThe strong early results of Agentforce are encouraging, but it's worth noting that it remains a small part of the overall business for now. Salesforce generated $37.9 billion in revenue during fiscal 2025, which ended Jan. 31, so it'll take some time before the new AI product has a significant direct impact. But the indirect impact could be substantial. It encourages users to take more of Salesforce's products, including Data Cloud, which should increase revenue and retention rates over time.\n\nSalesforce stock trades for about $260 as of this writing. At that price, shares are valued at just 23 times forward earnings estimates. That's a great value for a company that's leading the push toward agentic AI. With management's focus on improving profitability, it should be able to grow earnings per share at a double-digit pace for the foreseeable future, more than justifying its current price.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), known as TSMC, is the largest contract chip fabricator in the world. Thanks to its scale and leading technology, which commands a premium price, TSMC brings in over two-thirds of all spending on outsourced chip production. And that market share is growing.\n\nThere are two important reasons why TSMC continues to take market share: its scale and its technology. As the leading chip manufacturer, TSMC has more money to invest in expanding its production capabilities. When there's a ramp-up in spending on chips like we've seen with AI over the last few years, TSMC is best equipped to handle that demand.\n\nTSMC also takes a significant amount of its sales and reinvests it into research and development, ensuring its technology remains ahead of its closest competitors. That ensures it can continue winning contracts for the most high-end cutting-edge chips well into the future. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said TSMC isn't just the best in the world when it comes to its chip technology, it's \"the world's best by an incredible margin.\"\n\nManagement set lofty expectations for its second-quarter results, and it exceeded them based on its preliminary sales reporting. Based on its monthly sales data, TSMC grew revenue 39% last quarter on the back of strong AI-related demand.\n\nShares of the stock have climbed higher over the last few weeks on that strong monthly sales data and overall strength in chipmakers. Still, at $229 per share, the stock's forward P/E ratio is just 24. That's far lower than most leading AI stocks, especially chipmakers like Nvidia (which trades for more than 38 times forward earnings). Even after the run-up, the stock looks attractive, and it could continue to climb as AI spending doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon. It's a great option for your $300.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is the company behind Google. Many see AI as a major threat to Google, since more and more people may use OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude for searches for information. Perplexity has developed product searches and its own AI-first web browser, which could displace Google's Chrome browser. And OpenAI is reportedly following in its footsteps.\n\nThe fears accelerated in May when Apple's product chief testified that the company saw fewer Google search queries on its Safari browser in April, the first time it's ever experienced a drop in search traffic. The implication was that AI chatbots were stealing traffic from Google.\n\nBut so far Alphabet has managed to see much more benefit from artificial intelligence than any downsides. Google has integrated AI into Google Search with AI Overviews, Google Lens, and Circle to Search. The former has expanded the range of search queries on Google, increasing engagement and user satisfaction, according to management. Importantly, management says searches with AI Overviews monetize at similar rates as those without. Meanwhile, Google Lens and Circle to Search have led to an increase in product-related searches, which are generally more valuable for advertisers. As a result, Google Search revenue climbed 9% in the first quarter.\n\nThe bigger revenue driver from AI, though, is Google Cloud. The company has seen strong demand for cloud computing as developers look to train and develop their own software powered by large language models. That led to a 28% increase in revenue in the first quarter. More importantly, Google Cloud's operating margin expanded from 9.4% to 17.8% last quarter as it scales. And based on its bigger competitors, there could be a lot of margin expansion for Google Cloud in the years ahead. As such, it should provide strong support for bottom-line growth at Google in combination with the slow and steady growth of Google Search.\n\nOn top of that, Alphabet also has several other irons in the fire. The biggest of those other businesses is likely Waymo, which has grown quickly over the past few years with its self-driving car service. The company now says it completes 250,000 rides per week, and it's expanding to several more cities in 2025. The potential for Waymo once it scales and brings down the cost of production for its vehicles is significant, but in the near term Alphabet is willing to sink money into it to maintain its first-mover advantage.\n\nAt a current price of $181, shares of Alphabet trade for a forward P/E of just 19. That's far and away the least expensive of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks and an absolute bargain considering the growth potential of Google Cloud and the cash flow generated by Google Search. Investors with just $300 could see solid long-term returns from a stock that has remained resilient for years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:41:14.426706+00:00"}

CRM is placing a big bet on Agentforce, its AI agent platform, as the next major growth engine. This new AI-driven platform provides AI-powered software programs called AI agents, which are designed to automate business tasks and improve productivity.\n\nWithin two quarters since the launch, Agentforce has signed over 4,000 paid deals and reached more than $100 million in annual recurring revenues. This strong early adoption suggests that customers are beginning to see real value in using AI agents.\n\nSalesforce has integrated Agentforce across its core applications like Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Data Cloud and Slack. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, nearly one-third of Agentforce bookings came from customers expanding their usage. The platform uses real-time data from Salesforce’s Data Cloud to help businesses automate work, improve decision-making and reduce manual effort.\n\nTo further accelerate Agentforce adoption, Salesforce has undertaken several initiatives. The company has introduced new usage-based pricing models, added industry-specific templates, expanded its capabilities and enhanced the AgentExchange marketplace. CRM is also offering pre-built solutions for specific industries to help customers get started. It is also hiring more sales staff to boost Agentforce sales.\n\nIf executions go well, Agentforce could become a major revenue stream and possibly the next chapter in Salesforce’s growth story. It has the potential to boost both top-line growth and customer retention. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 8.6% and 9.2%, respectively.\n\nHow Are Rivals Faring Against Salesforce’s Agentforce?\n\nMicrosoft Corporation MSFT and ServiceNow, Inc.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model .\n\nDoes the July share price for Salesforce, Inc. ( NYSE:CRM ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.0%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$23b× (1 + 2.9%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.9%) = US$476b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$476b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$220b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$344b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$258, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\n\nNYSE:CRM Discounted Cash Flow July 13th 2025\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.168. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nSWOT Analysis for Salesforce\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

For instance, AI agents managed by humans are resolving 85% of customer service queries, and 25% of net new code for research and development was generated by AI in the first quarter.\n\n“Jobs will change, and as with every major technological shift, some will go away—and new ones will emerge,” Benioff added. “At Salesforce, we’ve experienced this first-hand: Our organization is being radically reshaped.”\n\nThousands of employees have been redeployed, and hiring for engineering roles has largely been on pause, he explained. In fact, 51% of Salesforce’s hiring in the first quarter was internal.\n\nHis comments come as he and other tech CEOs have recently pointed out how much AI is doing now. Last month, Benioff said AI does up to 50% of all work at Salesforce, in key functions like engineering, coding, and customer support. In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said 20%-30% of the tech giant’s code is written by AI. And in April, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said more than 30% of code at his company is generated by AI.\n\nBenioff also predicted at the World Economic Forum in Davos early this year today’s cohort of CEOs will be the last to lead all-human workforces.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:41:45.781743+00:00"}

On July 2, KeyBanc analyst Jackson Ader reaffirmed his Buy rating on Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), maintaining a $440 price target. Ader weighed both the potential benefits and short-term risks associated with Salesforce’s proposed acquisition of Informatica, which was first announced in May 2025.\n\nKeyBanc Analyst Stands by Salesforce (CRM) Despite Informatica Deal Concerns\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nAccording to the analyst, the deal could be a strategically sound decision. One of the key obstacles limiting the adoption of Salesforce’s AI assistant, Agentforce, is the lack of clean and accessible enterprise data. He noted that Informatica’s tools could help clean up and streamline the data used in Salesforce’s Data Cloud, which, in his view, would be a key step in improving the performance of Agentforce. Ader views this as a practical step toward enhancing how the company’s AI platform works, while also laying the groundwork for future product expansion.\n\nThe timing of the deal, however, raised some concerns. Rather than deepening a partnership, Salesforce has opted to fully acquire Informatica. Ader warned this decision could slow down progress on pressing data issues, possibly delaying improvements to Agentforce by a year or more.\n\nIn his view, while the acquisition could create value over time, the urgency of fixing Agentforce’s data gap may not align with the longer timeline required for integration.\n\nSalesforce Inc.

The price increase applies to products such as Agentforce, Customer360 Apps, and Slack. Agentforce, a suite of AI features, will be offered in two tiers, with prices starting at $125 per user per month for add-ons and $550 per user per month for Agentforce 1 Editions. The company also raised list prices for its Enterprise and Unlimited Editions for Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Field Service, and select Industries Clouds. This move has raised questions about Salesforce's pricing power and whether it can maintain its customer base without significant churn.\n\nThe article examines whether Salesforce truly has pricing power, defined by five sources: differentiation, substitutes, switching costs, willingness to pay, and brand & behavior. While Salesforce has limited substitutes at the enterprise level, high switching costs, and continuous innovation, its core product is no longer unique, and competitors like Microsoft Dynamics offer similar capabilities. The company's attrition rate remains around 8%, and the 2023 price hike did not impact this figure. However, the next price increase will be a test of customers' willingness to pay. Salesforce's brand strength is significant in enterprise IT, but it does not necessarily translate to real pricing power.\n\nThe price increase does not directly translate to a 6% revenue growth, as actual pricing depends on bundling, discounting, and negotiation. The move may indicate that Salesforce is confident in its ability to maintain customers despite the price hike. If successful, it could set a precedent for future price increases. However, if customers react negatively, it could impact growth. The company's guidance and customer reactions will be crucial in determining the impact of this price increase on Salesforce's stock and revenue growth.\n\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Salesforce by Sergey on June 6, 2025, which highlighted the company's potential as a backdoor play on AI energy infrastructure. The stock has appreciated, but details are not available. This is not the case. Summit Stocks shares a similar view on Salesforce, but emphasizes the company's pricing power and potential revenue growth following a recent 6% price increase across some of its core products. While the previous thesis focused on Salesforce's indirect AI play, the current analysis concentrates on its direct business performance and customer retention.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:41:54.019167+00:00"}

She emphasized the importance of cross-functional buy-in and setting the right tone at the top of the company.\n\n\n\nHowever, she also stressed the need to keep humans at the center of AI implementation.

What's leading the way? Artificial intelligence, of course.\n\nOn Monday, for example, CoreWeave (CRWV) made the second move of 2025's AI-linked M&A run on Monday with the announcement of a $9 billion acquisition of data center infrastructure provider Core Scientific (CORZ).\n\nThough the market largely lambasted the deal (CoreWeave and Core Scientific were down more than 3% and 17%, respectively, on Monday following the announcement), the acquisition is the latest in a line of big-ticket AI M&A announcements this year.\n\nTo be sure, dealmaking environment growth has been tepid through the first half of the year. But there are signs of life. The first half of 2025 has yielded approximately $750 billion in US M&A deals. That compares with 2024's first-half volume of approximately $720 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nOf the $750 billion in deals so far, AI-linked M&A deals announced this year have accounted for more than $65 billion, or a bit less than 10%. Globally, so far this year, there have been more than 240 deals involving AI startups compared to 2024's total count of 454, according to Mergermarket data reported by trade publication PYMNTS.\n\nThe hope is that the AI feeding frenzy will drive further M&A growth in the second half of the year.\n\nPart of what's driving AI deals right now is the chance for companies with room on their balance sheets to establish themselves as leaders in a burgeoning industry, said Matthew Warner, an M&A lawyer at Clifford Chance. \"This unique opportunity to become a new standard bearer helps prop up valuations and drives M&A deal activity because it's an opportunity that will exist only for this moment in time,\" Warner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nOther deals\n\nIn May, Salesforce (CRM) announced an $8 billion all-cash acquisition of AI-driven cloud data management provider Informatica (INFA), building out the CRM giant's AI infrastructure.\n\nAnd in July, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) completed its $14 billion all-cash acquisition of AI-native network technology specialist Juniper Networks (JNPR).\n\nPerhaps the marquee deal in the tech-AI space so far in 2025 has been Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) March announcement of its $32 billion all-cash acquisition of cloud security specialist Wiz, which Alphabet will use to enhance its cloud offering.\n\nAI-driven deals in the power sector have also made a mark, driven by the power demands of the industry.

The platform, which helps companies bring together and organize their customer data from various sources, surpassed 22 trillion records in the last reported quarter.\n\nIn the first quarter, nearly 60% of Salesforce’s top 100 deals included both Data Cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) features. Of all the new Data Cloud bookings, half came from existing customers, suggesting strong demand and client satisfaction. These numbers depict that Data Cloud is becoming a key part of Salesforce’s broader platform.\n\nData Cloud is also closely tied to Agentforce, Salesforce’s new AI-based product. Together, they form the core of Salesforce’s push into digital labor and intelligent automation. For AI agents to work well, they need quality data, and that’s where Data Cloud plays a big role.\n\nSalesforce is also using Data Cloud internally to boost efficiency. The platform has helped the company reduce lead routing time from 20 minutes to 19 seconds in Slack. We opine that if Salesforce can continue to deliver results with Data Cloud, it could become a major growth driver for the company in the years ahead.\n\nHow Salesforce’s Rivals Compare on Data Strategy\n\nAs Salesforce’s Data Cloud gains momentum, it faces tough competition from Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Snowflake Inc. SNOW, both active in enterprise data management.\n\nMicrosoft offers a strong alternative through its Azure Data services, which integrates its Power Platform, Dynamics 365 and Copilot AI tools. Microsoft has the advantage of broad enterprise reach and seamless integration across its ecosystem. Many businesses already use Azure for cloud storage and processing, making Microsoft a natural choice for managing and using enterprise data.\n\nSnowflake is another major competitor, known for its powerful cloud-based data warehouse. Unlike Salesforce, Snowflake focuses only on data, allowing companies to store, process and share large volumes easily. It also supports multiple clouds and has strong analytics tools.\n\nSalesforce’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates\n\nShares of Salesforce have plunged 18.1% year to date against the Zacks Computer – Software industry’s rise of 16.5%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, CRM trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.07, significantly below the industry’s average of 34.23.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:42:08.587263+00:00"}

Large language models (LLMs) are only as accurate as the information they can retrieve.\n\nThat’s where ZeroEntropy wants to make its mark. The San Francisco-based startup, co-founded by CEO Ghita Houir Alami and CTO Nicolas Pipitone, has raised $4.2 million in seed funding to help models retrieve relevant data quickly, accurately, and at scale.\n\nThe round was led by Initialized Capital, with participation from Y Combinator, Transpose Platform, 22 Ventures, a16z Scout, and a long list of angels, including operators from OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Front.\n\nZeroEntropy joins a growing wave of infrastructure companies hoping to use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to power search for the next generation of AI agents. Competitors range from MongoDB’s VoyageAI to early fellow YC startups like Sid.ai.\n\n“We’ve met a lot of teams building in and around RAG, but Ghita and Nicolas’s models outperform everything we’ve seen,” says Zoe Perret, partner at Initialized Capital. “Retrieval is undeniably a critical unlock in the next frontier of AI, and ZeroEntropy is building it.”\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grabs data from external documents and has become a go-to architecture for AI agents, whether it’s a chatbot surfacing HR policies or a legal assistant citing case law.\n\nYet the ZeroEntropy founders believe that for many AI apps, this layer is fragile: a cobbled collection of vector databases, keyword search, and re-ranking models. ZeroEntropy offers an API that manages ingestion, indexing, re-ranking, and evaluation.\n\nWhat that means is that — unlike a search product for enterprise employees like Glean — ZeroEntropy is strictly a developer tool. It quickly grabs data, even across messy internal documents. Houir Alami likens her startup to a “Supabase for search” referring to the popular open-source database that automates much of the database management.\n\n“Right now, most teams are either stitching together existing tools from the market or dumping their entire knowledge base into an LLM’s context window. The first approach is time-consuming to build and maintain,” Houir Alami said. “The second approach can cause compounding errors.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Dynatrace (DT) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.38 a share, just 28 days from its upcoming earnings release on August 6, 2025.\n\nDT has an Earnings ESP figure of +1.46%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.38 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.37.\n\nDT is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Salesforce.com (CRM).\n\nSlated to report earnings on August 27, 2025, Salesforce.com holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and its Most Accurate Estimate is $2.78 a share 49 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nFor Salesforce.com, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.77 is +0.23%.\n\nDT and CRM's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 6.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.77 per share, indicating a change of +8.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $11.3 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.8%.

For years, Salesforce delivered double-digit revenue increases. However, that pace has now cooled to single digits. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues rose just 7.7% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew by only 5.7%.\n\nThis slowdown reflects cautious enterprise spending amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical pressures. Analysts anticipate that this trend will persist, with mid-to-high single-digit growth expected for fiscal 2026 and 2027.\n\nThe impact is also visible in profit forecasts. Salesforce’s EPS is now expected to witness a CAGR of 12.9% over the next five years, a big drop from the 27.8% CAGR it posted over the previous five years.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis changing growth profile shows how businesses are adjusting their IT budgets. Instead of large digital transformation projects, many are opting for smaller, lower-risk investments.

This leadership position gives it a solid base to return to its solid growth trajectory.\n\nCan Salesforce Get Its Momentum Back?\n\nDespite the recent slowdown, Salesforce remains the dominant player in the CRM space. Its platform is deeply integrated across enterprise systems, making it a go-to solution for businesses.\n\nSalesforce has expanded beyond just CRM through acquisitions like Slack, Informatica, Own Company and Zoomin.

All it needed was a catalyst. From 2020 through 2024 alone, more than $300 billion was invested into data startups across more than 24,000 deals, according to PitchBook data.\n\n“Nobody was born in AI; that’s only three years old,” Dhillon said, referring to the current post-ChatGPT AI market. “For a larger company, to provide AI innovations to re-imagine the enterprise, the agentic enterprise in particular, it’s going to need a lot of retooling to make it happen.”\n\nBut is this strategy of snapping up companies built before a post-ChatGPT world the way to increase enterprise AI adoption in today’s rapidly innovating market? That’s unclear. Dhillon has doubts too.\n\n“There is a complete reset in how data is managed and flows around the enterprise,” Dhillon said. “If people want to seize the AI imperative, they have to redo their data platforms in a very big way. And this is where I believe you’re seeing all these data acquisitions, because this is the foundation to have a sound AI strategy.”\n\nGaurav Dhillon — the co-founder and former CEO of Informatica and current chairman and CEO at data integration company SnapLogic — echoed this in a recent interview with TechCrunch.\n\nThe success of AI companies, and AI applications, is determined by access to quality underlying data. Without it, there simply isn’t value — a belief shared by enterprise VCs. In a TechCrunch survey conducted in December 2024, enterprise VCs said data quality was a key factor to make AI startups stand out and succeed. And while some of these companies involved in these deals aren’t startups, the sentiment still stands.\n\nThe acquired companies may range in size, age, and focus area within the data stack, but they all have one thing in common. These companies are being bought in hopes the acquired technology will be the missing piece needed to get enterprises to adopt AI.\n\nThe market is consolidating. And if the deal flow in the past two months is any indicator — with Databricks buying Neon for $1 billion and Salesforce snapping up cloud management firm Informatica for $8 billion — momentum is building for more.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe current industry standard of bundling together a bunch of different data management solutions, each with its own specific focus, doesn’t work when you want AI to crawl around your data to find answers or build applications.\n\nIt makes sense that larger companies are looking to snap up startups that can plug into and fill existing gaps in their data stack. A perfect example of this trend is Fivetran’s recent acquisition of Census in May — which yes, was done in the name of AI.\n\nFivetran helps companies move their data from a variety of sources into cloud databases. For the first 13 years of its business, it didn’t allow customers to move this data back out of said databases, which is exactly what Census offers. This means prior to this acquisition, Fivetran customers needed to work with a second company to create an end-to-end solution.\n\nTo be clear, this isn’t meant to cast shade on Fivetran. At the time of the deal, George Fraser, the co-founder and CEO of Fivetran, told TechCrunch that while moving data in and out of these warehouses seems like two sides of the same coin, it’s not that simple; the company even tried and abandoned an in-house solution to this problem.\n\n“Technically speaking, if you look at the code underneath [these] services, they’re actually pretty different,” Fraser said at the time. “You have to solve a pretty different set of problems in order to do this.”\n\nThis situation helps illustrate how the data market has transformed in the last decade. For Sanjeev Mohan, a former Gartner analyst who now runs SanjMo, his own data trend advisory firm, these types of scenarios are a big driver of the current wave of consolidation.\n\n“This consolidation is being driven by customers being fed up with a multitude of products that are incompatible,” Mohan said. “We live in a very interesting world where there are a lot of different data storage solutions, you can do open source, they can go to Kafka, but the one area where we have failed is metadata. Dozens of these products are capturing some metadata but to do their job, it’s an overlap.”\n\nGood for startups\n\nThe broader market plays a role here, too, Mohan said. Data startups are struggling to raise capital, Mohan said, and an exit is better than having to wind down or load up on debt. For the acquirers, adding features gives them better pricing leverage and an edge against their peers.\n\n“If Salesforce or Google isn’t acquiring these companies, then their competitors likely are,” Derek Hernandez, a senior emerging tech analyst at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. “The best solutions are being acquired currently. Even if you have an award-winning solution, I don’t know that the outlook for staying private ultimately wins over going to a larger [acquirer].”\n\nThis trend brings big benefits to the startups getting acquired. The venture market is starving for exits and the current quiet period for IPOs doesn’t leave them a lot of opportunities. Getting acquired not only provides that exit, but in many cases it also gives these founding teams room to keep building.\n\nMohan agreed and added that many data startups are feeling the pains of the current market regarding exits and the slow recovery of venture funding.\n\n“At this point in time, acquisition has been a much more favorable exit strategy for them,” Hernandez said. “So I think, kind of both sides are very incentivized to get to the finish line on these. And I think Informatica is a good example of that, where even with a bit of a haircut from where Salesforce was talking to them last year, it’s still, you know, was the best solution, according to their board.”\n\nWhat happens next\n\nBut the doubt still remains if this acquisition strategy will achieve the buyers’ goals.\n\nAs Dhillon pointed out, the database companies being acquired weren’t necessarily built to easily work with the rapidly changing AI market. Plus, if the company with the best data wins the AI world, will it make sense for data and AI companies to be separate entities?\n\n“I think a lot of the value is in merging the major AI players with the data management companies,” Hernandez said. “I don’t know that a stand-alone data management company is particularly incentivized to remain so and, kind of like, play a third party between enterprises and AI solutions.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:42:19.664958+00:00"}

This rebound suggests a potential turning point after a difficult year.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe following analysis examines the company’s recent performance and evaluates whether PATH presents a compelling buying opportunity in today’s market environment.\n\nAutomation Boom Fuels PATH’s Momentum\n\nUiPath remains a strong force in the booming Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market, which is poised for substantial expansion over the coming years. Its end-to-end automation platform positions the company to seize opportunities as demand for AI-driven solutions surges.\n\nA critical driver of PATH’s success is its strategic alliances with top technology giants. Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, and Salesforce CRM continue to play pivotal roles in expanding UiPath’s reach and capabilities. These partnerships not only bolster PATH’s credibility but also integrate its offerings into broader enterprise ecosystems powered by Microsoft Azure, Amazon’s AWS and Salesforce Cloud solutions.\n\nThe company boasts high customer retention, with net retention rates ranging between 110% and 115%, underscoring its ability to expand usage within existing accounts. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, UiPath reported a 6% increase in revenues year over year, reaching $357 million. Additionally, its annual recurring revenue rose 12% to $1.69 billion, reflecting the strength of its subscription-based business model and customer loyalty.\n\nWith a strong global presence, a robust partner ecosystem, particularly with Microsoft, Amazon, and Salesforce, and a continued focus on intelligent automation, UiPath is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the evolving RPA and enterprise automation market.\n\nPATH's Strong Financial Position\n\nPATH boasts a robust financial position, highlighted by its strong balance sheet. As of the fiscal first quarter, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, with no outstanding debt. This debt-free status ensures that its cash reserves are available to fuel growth initiatives and strategic investments. Such financial flexibility increases PATH’s ability to drive innovation and expand its market presence without financial strain.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s liquidity is robust. At the end of the fiscal first quarter, PATH reported a current ratio of 2.95, exceeding the industry average of 2.34. A current ratio above 1 indicates that a company has sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The company’s strong liquidity positions it to navigate economic uncertainties and enhances its capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the competitive RPA market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:42:21.550699+00:00"}

(NYSE:CRM) saw a decent share price growth of 15% on the NYSE over the last few months. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Salesforce’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Salesforce?\n\nGreat news for investors – Salesforce is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $361.65, but it is currently trading at US$272 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Salesforce’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nView our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nWhat does the future of Salesforce look like?\n\nNYSE:CRM Earnings and Revenue Growth July 5th 2025\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 65% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Salesforce. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CRM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:42:25.691873+00:00"}

Each is using AI in a different way, but all are seeing solid traction with their AI offerings.\n\nLet's look at why all five of these stocks appear to be solid investment options over the long term.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir has gone from polarizing to a powerhouse. Its revenue is not just growing quickly, it's accelerating. The first quarter marked the seventh straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth, up 39% year over year. U.S. commercial sales are leading the way, surging 71% last quarter, as customers embrace its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Meanwhile, its government business continues to see strong traction. U.S. government revenue jumped 45% last quarter, while the company also recently secured a large contract with NATO.\n\nAIP is what makes Palantir special. The platform doesn't just gather and analyze data; it structures it into an \"ontology\" that links digital inputs to real-world assets. This allows its software to use AI to identify risks and provide real solutions. The company has also recently added AI agents to its platform to automatically act on those solutions.\n\nCurrently, AIP is being used by companies across a wide range of industries to help solve very different problems. This breadth of use cases is why Palantir has such a huge growth opportunity still in front of it.\n\n2. GitLab\n\nGitLab is at the heart of secure software development. Already a leader in DevSecOps (development, security, and operations), the company just launched GitLab 18, which includes over 30 enhancements to its platform, highlighted by its new GitLab Duo Agent Platform. This allows users to deploy AI agents across the entire software development life cycle, not just for code generation, but for tasks like testing, documentation, and compliance.\n\nIt's addressing a key pain point, as according to a recent William Blair survey, developers spend only about 20% of their time writing code, leaving huge room for productivity gains in the remaining 80%. The launch also brought new features in security and compliance, while GitLab expanded partnerships with Amazon and Anthropic, reinforcing its DevSecOps leadership.\n\nGitLab has seen strong revenue growth, including 27% last quarter. Customers are expanding seats and upgrading to higher tiers as AI-driven development takes off. While some fear that AI might replace developers, GitLab is proving it can make them far more efficient, and that makes the company a long-term winner.\n\n3. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce is pushing to become a digital workforce leader with its Agentforce platform. Already the dominant player in customer relationship management software, it's using its huge installed base to launch a new AI agent ecosystem. With over 4,000 paying customers since its October launch, Agentforce is off to a strong start.\n\nThe company's strategy centers on unifying apps, data, automation, and metadata into a single framework called ADAM to power a digital labor force. It offers prebuilt agents and no-code tools through Agentforce so customers can build their own AI agents. It recently introduced a new flexible Agentforce consumption-based pricing model that is more aligned with outcomes in order to help increase adoption and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nIf Salesforce can become a digital workforce leader, the stock will have a lot of upside from here.\n\n4. ServiceNow\n\nServiceNow is quietly becoming one of the most important AI software companies in the enterprise space. The strength of its platform has always been connecting siloed departments and helping organizations streamline their operations, but AI is helping take that to another level.\n\nServiceNow is helping companies digitize operations and cut costs, which is exactly what businesses need in today's uncertain macroenvironment. Its generative AI assistant, Now Assist, does this in several ways, including providing an AI chatbot to handle questions, a text-to-code generator, and a case summarization tool. While best known for its information technology (IT) management platform, it has broadened into other areas such as HR, customer service, and more through its Now Platform.\n\nAI is already fueling growth, with Pro Plus deals, which include its AI solutions, quadrupling year over year in Q1. With the help of AI, it looks like the company has a huge opportunity ahead.\n\n5. Adobe\n\nAdobe isn't chasing AI, it's weaving it into everything it does. Its Firefly generative AI model allows users to create content from text prompts that they can further manipulate with Adobe's creative tools, such as Photoshop. Importantly, it also provides intellectual property protection, which is important for enterprises that want to avoid any potential lawsuits. The strategy is bringing in new users and keeping existing customers locked in.\n\nBut Adobe's AI push extends well beyond creative professionals. It's also embedding AI tools into its Document Cloud and Express solutions to help users create content, analyze documents, and even automate marketing. Acrobat and Express products hit 700 million monthly active users last quarter, and subscription revenue for this segment jumped 15%.\n\nWhile it's not seeing explosive growth, Adobe is a solid AI compounder with a sticky customer base and expanding use cases.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:42:27.461151+00:00"}

In a post-Identifier for Advertisers environment that disrupted mobile user acquisition strategies, Axon 2 served as a critical catalyst for recovery. While Western mobile gaming experienced stagnation in 2022, Axon 2 reignited ad-driven momentum. Though in-app purchases are seeing modest, mid-single-digit growth, AppLovin’s MAX publisher base is expanding at a significantly faster rate, underscoring Axon 2’s strategic advantage.\n\nGoogle, Microsoft MSFT and Salesforce CRM are rapidly advancing generative AI. Microsoft integrates AI in Office via Copilot and expands Azure’s AI. Google embeds AI in Workspace and enhances Vertex AI. Salesforce incorporates AI across its CRM, especially through Einstein Copilot and Data Cloud. Microsoft is also focusing on AI governance, while Google is strengthening AI security.

In the first quarter of 2025, revenues surged 40% year over year, reflecting strong market demand. Adjusted EBITDA jumped 83% year over year, showcasing improved operational efficiency. Net income skyrocketed 144% from the prior year, demonstrating APP’s ability to translate revenue growth into significant profitability.

Many tech companies are scrambling to hire top-notch AI leaders and researchers, using multi-million dollar paychecks to entice them.\n\nThe latest example of how essential some humans are in the AI era came in the last few weeks, when Facebook-parent Meta went on a spending spree to beef up its all-important AI operations.

It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $2.77, marking a 8.2% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $10.13 billion, indicating a 8.66% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $11.3 per share and a revenue of $41.17 billion, indicating changes of +10.78% and +8.64%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Salesforce.com should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.04% lower. Right now, Salesforce.com possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Salesforce.com has a Forward P/E ratio of 23.83 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 26.9.\n\nAlso, we should mention that CRM has a PEG ratio of 1.85. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.35.\n\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 39, placing it within the top 16% of over 250 industries.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:42:39.099699+00:00"}

PLTR has soared 75% year to date, far outpacing the broader industry’s 15% average gain and the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s modest 5% advance. The question now facing investors: Does PLTR still offer an attractive entry point, or is it smarter to wait for a pullback?\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAIP Ignites: Palantir’s Secret Weapon Is Now the Growth Engine\n\nAt the heart of Palantir’s recent breakout is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which is rapidly evolving into its primary growth engine. In the first quarter of 2025, U.S. commercial revenues surged 71% year over year and climbed 19% sequentially, propelling the segment past the $1 billion annual run rate milestone for the first time. Total contract value in this business soared 239% YoY, while the number of deals worth over $1 million more than doubled compared to the prior year.\n\nPalantir’s AIP bootcamps — intensive onboarding and implementation sessions — have been instrumental in accelerating adoption. These programs equip enterprise clients to deploy production-ready AI solutions in record time, drastically reducing the time-to-value and demonstrating the platform’s intuitive interface and scalability.\n\nAt its core, AIP enables organizations to embed autonomous AI agents across workflows, shrinking decision timelines and scaling productivity by multiples, not mere percentages. While competitors focus on AI model development, PLTR is winning on deployment, offering turnkey, enterprise-ready solutions that drive real results from day one. The U.S. commercial business has now become Palantir’s most dynamic revenue driver, and AIP is the key accelerant.\n\nBig Tech’s AI Push Intensifies\n\nTech giants like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet’s Google GOOGL, and Salesforce CRM are also ramping up their AI initiatives. Microsoft continues to expand its Copilot integrations across Office and Azure while strengthening AI governance. Google enhances Workspace and Vertex AI, with a growing emphasis on security and compliance. Meanwhile, Salesforce is layering AI across its CRM ecosystem through Einstein Copilot and Data Cloud, pushing toward deeply personalized user experiences.\n\nDespite this intensifying competition from Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce, Palantir stands apart. Its strength lies in serving mission-critical sectors, such as defense, intelligence, and healthcare, where security, trust, and performance are non-negotiable. While Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google excel in customer-facing tools and broad AI frameworks, Palantir delivers deeply embedded, operational AI that drives high-stakes decision-making. That is a competitive edge that we believe its peers have yet to match.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:42:41.078124+00:00"}

Despite a sequential decline of 15% Adobe’s bright prospects, driven by an expanding AI portfolio, are noteworthy.\n\n\n\nSeveral factors are driving Adobe’s cash flow growth. Its core Digital Media segment, led by Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, continues to deliver strong recurring revenues. Subscription models provide consistent income, while growing adoption of AI-driven features, such as Firefly, Acrobat AI Assistant and Express, expands customer engagement and product stickiness. Adobe benefits from a rising Remaining Performance Obligations of $19.69 billion, with 67% expected to be recognized within a year, offering visibility into future cash inflows.\n\n\n\nThe question now is whether Adobe can maintain this momentum. With $5.71 billion in cash and short-term investments as of May 30, 2025, Adobe is well-positioned to continue investing in product innovation, AI integration and strategic acquisitions. Strong cash reserves also give Adobe flexibility to navigate economic headwinds while continuing share repurchases, evidenced by the 8.6 million shares repurchased in the second quarter alone, and currently have $10.90 billion remaining as part of its $25 billion authorization.\n\n\n\nFor investors, these indicators reinforce confidence in Adobe’s ability to deliver long-term value. As the company evolves from a creative software leader to a broader digital experience and AI powerhouse, its financial strength is laying the foundation for enduring momentum.\n\nMicrosoft & Salesforce Challenge Adobe’s Market Hold\n\nMicrosoft MSFT competes with Adobe through its robust cloud and productivity suites, particularly Azure and Microsoft 365 Copilot, which are integrated with creative tools and workflow automation. Unlike Adobe’s specialized product lineup, Microsoft’s scale across cloud and AI ecosystems offers seamless cross-platform selling opportunities. In third-quarter fiscal 2025, Microsoft generated roughly $37 billion, up 16% year over year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections.\n\n\n\nSalesforce CRM directly challenges Adobe in the digital marketing and experience space with Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud and Gen AI-powered customer tools. While Adobe excels in creative workflows, Salesforce leads in CRM-based automation and enterprise reach.

And one marketing company that has been investing heavily into AI agents is Salesforce (CRM -0.53%). CEO Marc Benioff is extremely excited about the potential for its Agentforce platform to automate tasks and help add efficiency for businesses, making it easier for them to connect with their customers through AI.\n\nRecently, Benioff made a startling claim: Between 30% and 50% of the work at Salesforce is now down via AI. While that's an impressive statement to make, here's why I'd hold off on investing in the stock.\n\nBenioff makes a big claim, but will the results back it up?\n\nIf a company says that close to 50% of its work is now done by AI, my first expectation would be to see its financials improve -- significantly. And that's what investors should be looking for when Salesforce reports its latest earnings numbers, which should be around late August or early September.\n\nWhile Benioff says this added efficiency now allows workers to focus on \"higher-value work,\" then at the very least, the company's growth rate should accelerate if that's the case. By doing more meaningful work, that should presumably mean that it may be winning over more customers in the process; otherwise, what would it be all for?\n\nInvestors should exercise some skepticism with these types of claims because they can be convenient to make and sound impressive, but if they aren't backed up by stronger financials, then it can be hard to really substantiate them. And the problem is Benioff in the past has often been dismissive of other companies' AI capabilities while boasting about his own company's Agentforce platform. In the past, for example, he has referred to Microsoft's Copilot as the latest iteration of its Clippy assistant, which drew the ire of many users decades ago.\n\nBenioff has been a great promoter and marketer of Salesforce, but CEOs can sometimes hype up their businesses a bit too much. Despite its investments into AI, Salesforce has delivered just single digit revenue growth in its most recent quarter (which ended on April 30), with sales rising by 8% to $9.8 billion -- that's slower than the 11% growth rate it achieved a year earlier.\n\nInvestors aren't buying the hype\n\nFor all the excitement Benioff has about his company and Agentforce, investors don't appear to be sharing that same enthusiasm. As of Tuesday's close, the tech stock has fallen by more than 18% since the start of the year. While it's not near its 52-week low of $230 just yet, investor sentiment has been souring on the stock, which may be attributable to its low growth rate and concerns of a slowing economy due to trade wars. If the economy slows down, companies may scale back on marketing expenditures and investments into AI.\n\nBenioff's latest claim also may set high expectations for the business when it goes to report earnings. The stock already trades at more than 40 times its trailing earnings, and a growth rate in the single digits likely isn't going to impress investors. For Salesforce to prove that AI is really transforming its business, investors should expect to see a drastically improved top or bottom line, or at least a very strong guidance.\n\nA wait-and-see approach makes sense with Salesforce\n\nSalesforce's CEO talks a good game but until the company backs it up with some stronger financials to help make its valuation look more justifiable, I'd hold off on investing in the stock today. The danger is that when expectations are set so high, it can make it difficult for the business to meet them. I'm always wary of CEOs who pump up their businesses so much, as that can set their stocks up for declines later on, especially if reality doesn't line up with those rosy claims and projections.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:42:46.280011+00:00"}

If you’re in the habit of listening to CEOs, you’ll notice a new trend among leaders talking about AI.\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a recent interview that AI now does up to 50% of all work at the company, in key functions like engineering, coding, and customer support. In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said 20% to 30% of the tech giant’s code is now written by AI coding assistants.

In the interview, he described AI’s ability to do up to half the work at his company as a “digital labor revolution,”, but he didn’t clarify what\n\nThe metric that AI tools are responsible for generating 30% of all new software code at Google is equally fuzzy. Does the number refer to raw lines of code that programmers suggest, committed code, or code accepted into production?\n\nFor example, on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Pichai explained that AI coding tools like Goose increase the productivity of Google’s engineers by approximately 10%, calculated by tracking hours saved weekly. However, that number assumes that engineers use those extra hours to work more rather than slack off.\n\n“The truth is, we don’t yet have a common framework for measuring what ‘percent of work’ really means in the age of AI,” said Malvika Jethmalani, founder of human capital advisory firm Atvis Group, in a message to Fortune. “Are we counting lines of code, tasks completed, hours saved, or business outcomes influenced?”\n\nBut how significant these CEO flexes from Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft ultimately are is difficult to know.

And in April, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said over 30% of code at Google is now generated by AI.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOther experts, however, say comments like those by Benioff are not a flex at all, but simply the reality of AI changing the world of work. Holger Mueller, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research, told Fortune that generative AI will massively change the work of the knowledge worker—though, in his view, without generating mass layoffs. “With developed countries facing a labor and talent shortage, more automation is the biggest promise to deliver long-term competitiveness,” he said.\n\nBut while there may be some truth in CEO statements about how much work is already being done by AI, the numbers are very vague and abstract, said Netherlands-based occupational psychologist Marais Bester. “We often see that CEOs use this type of language,” he said. “I think it’s also sort of an indicator to employees, saying, you better watch your back, you better perform.” From a business psychology standpoint, that’s not good leadership, he added.\n\n“I was actually a bit disappointed by that comment,” he said, referring to Benioff’s statement,“because I don’t think that we’ll ever move towards a space where it will only be AI technologies being utilized as employees within an organization. There will be complementary relationships between human employees and technology.”\n\nThe flex can even cause anxiety among employees who hear it as “we’re automating you out,” Jethmalani said. “That kind of message can erode trust and undermine adoption at a moment when we need employees to show up highly engaged and willing to experiment and innovate with AI.”\n\nShonna Waters, an organizational psychologist and CEO of advisory firm Fractional Insights, also pointed out that while Benioff touts how much Salesforce is using AI—and how much its clients are adopting that company’s AgentForce platform for managing AI agents—research from firms like Gartner suggests that many of these AI-driven projects are likely to fail by 2027 because their value is unclear.\n\n“I do think that really sets the stage for companies to be really thoughtful about how they integrate AI into their organizational design,” she said, adding that companies also must deal with the disconnect between what C-suite executives say about AI and what’s actually happening on the ground.\n\n“These leaders are making these bold claims, and employees are experiencing something pretty different,” she said. CEOs, she explained, often have more optimism about AI than employees, while employees have more angst.\n\nThe companies that will succeed, she said, will be those with “structural empathy”—that is, building systems that bring in frontline worker voices. “At the end of the day, you need the humans to still be the ones actually adopting the AI you need to bring them along with you journey and figure out how to do it in concert with them, as opposed to something you’re doing to them.”\n\nBester said CEOs may be using this flex as little more than a boast to competitors. They are saying “just look at us, we are ahead of the curve on this,” he said. A better message from Benioff, he said, “would have been about how by utilizing AI and with the human capital strength that we already have, we are able to do so much more than we are already doing in terms of creating efficiencies and better value for our customers.”\n\nFor now, CEOs “obviously want to show their stakeholders that they are on board with AI” and focusing on efficiency, margins, and building value for shareholders,” Bester added. “But it could potentially backfire” if organizations don’t keep in mind how they are communicating with employees.\n\nOr perhaps, if they have to rehire humans down the line if AI proves unable to do so much work. In May, just months after touting AI’s ability to replace human workers, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski reversed an AI-driven hiring freeze and announced the company is adding more human staff. He told Bloomberg that Klarna is now hiring to ensure customers always have the option to speak with a real person. “From a brand perspective, a company perspective, I just think it’s so critical that you are clear to your customer that there will always be a human if you want,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:42:54.455282+00:00"}

The platform is swiftly becoming the company’s most compelling growth driver within the enterprise landscape, transforming how organizations harness AI at scale.\n\nThe adoption of AIP is accelerating at a rapid pace. In the first quarter of 2025, U.S. commercial revenues surged an impressive 71% year over year and rose 19% sequentially. This helped Palantir cross a significant threshold, achieving a $1 billion annual revenue run rate in this segment for the first time. The total contract value within U.S. commercial operations soared 239% from the prior-year level. Notably, the number of deals exceeding $1 million more than doubled year over year, signaling growing enterprise trust and larger platform footprints.\n\nPalantir’s strategic deployment of AIP bootcamps — high-impact, intensive training sessions —has played a critical role in this acceleration. These programs are designed to help enterprise customers quickly and efficiently integrate AIP into their workflows. The results are compelling — clients are deploying production-grade AI solutions faster than ever, significantly shortening time-to-value and showcasing the platform’s intuitive design and real-world readiness.\n\nAt its core, AIP empowers organizations to embed autonomous AI agents across operations, compressing decision cycles and multiplying productivity, not in increments, but in orders of magnitude. While the broader market remains preoccupied with the evolution of AI model development, PLTR is carving out dominance on the deployment side, delivering plug-and-play, enterprise-ready solutions that produce measurable impact from day one. U.S. commercial operations have emerged as Palantir’s most energized growth engine, and AIP works as the catalyst.\n\nEnterprise AI Integration Reaches a New Inflection Point\n\nTech giants like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, and Salesforce CRM are deepening their commitment to generative AI. Microsoft continues to embed Copilot into its Office suite and expand AI capabilities through Azure, while also investing in robust AI governance frameworks. Google enhances its AI portfolio through Workspace and Vertex AI, and intensifies its focus on AI security and compliance. Meanwhile, Salesforce is integrating AI across its customer relationship management stack with Einstein Copilot and Data Cloud, while also innovating in personalized, real-time customer experiences.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:42:58.465844+00:00"}

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to investigate if the company's decent financials had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Salesforce's ROE today.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Salesforce is:\n\n10% = US$6.2b ÷ US$61b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2025).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.10 in profit.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nSalesforce's Earnings Growth And 10% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, Salesforce's ROE is not much to talk about. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 14%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Salesforce grew its net income at a significant rate of 26% in the last five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nWe then compared Salesforce's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 21% in the same 5-year period.\n\nNYSE:CRM Past Earnings Growth July 1st 2025\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.

That’s because emerging technologies, paired with changing consumer spending habits and interests, is bringing about a new journey for product discovery.\n\nConsumer journeys now include AI\n\nSalesforce data shows that shopping aided by artificial intelligence could be a major trend for holiday 2025. The technology giant projects that, this holiday season, AI will influence $260 billion worth of online sales and $1.6 trillion in in-store sales.\n\nSalesforce, which takes periodic consumer pulses, found that nearly four in 10 shoppers use an AI chatbot during their shopping journeys; about 5 percent of shoppers now begin their product discovery with publicly available large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT’s shopping feature. One in 10 Gen Z shoppers starts their journey with an LLM.\n\nAlready, nearly half—44 percent—of consumers said they trust AI-generated, personalized product recommendations. Caila Schwartz, director, consumer strategy & insights for Salesforce, said AI-assisted search is redefining the way consumers view commerce.\n\n“In our behavioral data, we see that LLM-generated traffic referrals to e-commerce websites convert very, very well—much better than social, and pretty much on par with more established and traditional traffic sources,” she said. “We know these are tools that consumers not only are leaning into, but [that] they trust and are buying from.”\n\nWhile agentic AI—which is meant to autonomously complete specific tasks—has been tossed around as a probable next step for consumer-facing technology, it’s not widely adopted in the industry today. Schwartz said she expects AI shopping agents could be the next frontier of e-commerce, and consumers’ use of LLMs is teeing up agentic’s potential future.\n\n“The expectations that shoppers are building based off their experience with these LLMs will transform into how they expect to interact with the brand themselves, and the retailer themselves,” she said. “Shoppers will be leaning into…AI agents, brand-owned and retail-owned agents, because their expectation for that personalized, high-touch, white-glove type of journey is going to extend.”\n\nIn the consumer context, that could mean asking an agent to purchase a gift on their behalf, or enlisting an agent to monitor the price of a high-ticket item leading up to holiday season and Cyber Week.\n\nSalesforce’s AI projections don’t end with consumer behavior. The technology giant projects that agentic AI will help move the needle inside brands and retailers’ own offices. It projects that 35 percent of all retailers will use agentic AI to amp employees’ day-to-day work during the holiday season. While Schwartz noted that she expects customer service to be impacted by AI agents, she said Salesforce continues to monitor other business functions that could latch on to the burgeoning technology.\n\nIn-store transactions are still popular—especially with young consumers\n\nFor all Salesforce’s discussion about emerging technologies, the store is still expected to reign supreme for holiday 2025 shopping; just over half of consumers said, when shopping on Black Friday, they prefer in-store shopping, up 20 percentage points from 2024’s figure of 31 percent.\n\nGen Z shoppers, who are often written off as digital natives, led the pack on in-store Black Friday hunting, with 65 percent of shoppers noting they prefer to shop in stores on Cyber Week. That, they report, is because the product is immediately in their hands, they prefer the experience of being in a store and they feel that discovery is stronger in the store.\n\nSalesforce projects that for every $1 a Gen Z consumer spends digitally, they will spend an additional $3 in stores during holiday 2025. That means brands and retailers need to find a way to further perpetuate unified commerce—and bring emerging technologies under the store umbrella, Salesforce contends.\n\n“Being able to unlock [experiences] across channels, unlock data, to unify that data across those channels so that the brands and retailers can create a consistent and personalized experience even when they’re in store, is really going to be the opportunity moving forward, especially as these younger generations gain more buying power,” Schwartz said.\n\nValue hasn’t disappeared, either\n\nConsumers continue to place an onus on value—Salesforce’s theme for holiday 2024—in 2025; that’s especially true among U.S. consumers, nearly three in 10 of whom indicated that their personal financial situation has declined over the last six months.\n\nA major portion of the reason that shoppers continue to seek out value comes from uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff tumult, which has seen about one-third of American consumers frontloading purchases before prices increase and more than 40 percent of U.S. shoppers buying only what they need.\n\nSalesforce expects that the overall discount rate for holiday 2025 will drop by 2 percent compared with 2024, which could see the one-quarter of U.S. consumers who said they’re holding off on large splurge purchases waiting until Cyber Week to purchase high-ticket items this year.\n\nConsumers’ focus on value could also be driving resale forward; one in five consumers plan to purchase secondhand goods because of tariffs, and nearly half of U.S. consumers say they will gift a secondhand item this year. Salesforce projects resale will see a consumer spend of $64 billion for the holiday season.\n\nUnlike 2024, when players like Shein and Temu dominated holiday, consumers seem to be hyper focused on three key facets when it comes to loyalty: free delivery, lower prices and better product quality.\n\n“We haven’t seen product quality land in the top three of this list since around the 2021-2022 era, when consumers had a lot higher buying power, the economy just looked a lot different. Last year, we know that product quality was very low on the list, especially with the rise of these discount and value brands like Temu and Shein,” she said.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:43:20.627730+00:00"}

The index is now up 4% for the year after overcoming several challenges, including tariffs, inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions.\n\nTech Stocks Rally\n\nThe Nasdaq is also on track to hit a new record high.

Let's look at five bargain tech stocks ready for a bull run.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of below 16.5x analyst 2025 estimates, Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) is the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks.\n\nWhile best known for its Google search engine, Alphabet has a solid collection of market-leading and emerging businesses. Its YouTube streaming service is the most-watched in the world and the fourth-largest digital advertising platform. Meanwhile, its fast-growing Google Cloud service is the third-largest cloud computing company on the planet. On the emerging technology side, the company has jumped out to the lead in autonomous driving with its Waymo robotaxi service, while it's also at the forefront of quantum computing with its Willow chip.\n\nWhile there is some worry about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on its search business, Google has a strong offering through its Gemini model. In addition, the company has big distribution and ad network advantages. With its new AI mode, users also don't have to even leave its popular Chrome browser and can conveniently toggle between AI, search, and news to get the answers they are seeking. Expect Alphabet to be an AI winner, not an AI loser, setting up the stock for solid gains in the years ahead.\n\n2. Salesforce\n\nSoftware-as-as-service (SaaS) stocks historically trade at premium valuations due to their recurring revenue models and strong visibility. However, with a forward P/E of around 20.5x and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.5 -- with PEGs below 1 indicating a stock is undervalued -- Salesforce (CRM -0.53%) currently finds its stock on the clearance rack.\n\nDespite its low valuation, Salesforce has strong growth opportunities ahead. It is looking to become a leader in agentic AI through its Agentforce platform, where customers can create AI agents that will complete tasks with little human intervention. Even though the product has only been available for two quarters, Salesforce already has more than 4,000 paying customers and many more in pilots. Its Data Cloud offering, which helps customers unify their data into a single source, has also seen huge growth.\n\nThe company's AI agent strategy is already evolving, as it is looking to tightly integrate Agentforce and Data Cloud with its apps and metadata to help lead the way in digital labor. In order to help increase adoption and improve customer satisfaction, the company also recently introduced a new flexible Agentforce consumption-based pricing model that is more aligned with outcomes. If Salesforce can become an AI agent leader, then the stock should have strong upside from here.\n\n3. Alibaba\n\nTrading at a forward P/E of just 10 times and a cash-rich balance sheet, Alibaba (BABA 3.30%) is one of the cheapest stocks around. The company is both an e-commerce and cloud computing leader in China, and it has been seeing strong AI momentum. Earlier this year, it announced that Apple would use its AI models to help power its Apple Intelligence features in China, and it just launched new Qwen3 AI models that are compatible with Apple devices.\n\nAt the same time, the company has done a great job turning around its core e-commerce platforms by first investing to reaccelerate its gross merchandise volume (GMV) growth and then better monetizing that higher GMV through a small software fee and its AI-powered marketing tool, Quanzhantui.\n\nIt's also seen strong momentum in its Cloud Intelligence segment. Last quarter, the segment's revenue jumped by 18%, while AI-related revenue more than doubled for the seventh straight quarter. In addition, the company expects its international commerce segment (AIDC) to turn profitable within the next year, which would be a big earnings driver.\n\n4. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nWith a forward P/E of 23 times and a PEG of just 0.2 times, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%) is one of the cheapest chip stocks out there. The company has been seeing strong revenue growth and become the market leader in central processing units (CPUs) in the data center arena.\n\nThat said, the company's biggest opportunity moving forward is with its graphics processing units (GPUs). While the company is a distant second behind market-leader Nvidia, it has carved out a nice niche with AI inference, which isn't as technically demanding as training and where costs become more important. This is key for AMD, as the inference market is eventually expected to become the much bigger market. If it can only take a little share away from Nvidia in this area, AMD should see very strong growth ahead.\n\n5. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nWith a forward P/E of around 19 times and a PEG near 1, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) remains attractively valued. The company is the leading semiconductor manufacturing contractor in the world, making chips for companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Apple.\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing is a difficult business, and with its main competitors Intel and Samsung struggling, TSMC has turned into the primary manufacturer of advanced chips. This has given it strong pricing power and helped it become an invaluable partner to chip designers.\n\nAs such, TSMC is one of the best-positioned companies to continue to benefit from increasing AI infrastructure spending. It also has a big future opportunity with autonomous driving and robotaxis, as these cars will require a lot of advanced chips, as well.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:43:26.254556+00:00"}

We are watching Salesforce, PayPal, Block, and CoreWeave. First up, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff says that 30 to 50% of the company's work is being done by artificial intelligence. This move to embrace AI that led to the software company cutting over 1,000 positions this year to make room for the technology. Cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike and other tech companies are making similar decisions to embrace AI. Let's bring back in Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and Managing Member, back in for this. Okay, we were talking about some of these cuts as well and the move towards AI, how that's impacting not just head count, but the productivity gains that we're seeing across some organizations. It seems like another similar story.\n\n00:00:59 Thomas Hayes\n\nYeah, there's no question about it. I I think again that the the where you want to be focused in the second half is not the obvious AI plays. It's in it's in the Brad Jacobs of the world like the GXO Logistics with the robotics A, with the uh QXO with the building supply, applying these technologies. You know, Brad Jacobs bought Beacon Roofing Supply and he paid 11 times EBITDA and everyone's like, oh, isn't he like a smart value guy? Uh he kind of overpaid because he needed a platform company. He goes, no, no, no. We're going to double we're going to implement these technologies and we are going to double EBITDA over the next few years. So he effectively paid five times EBITDA and you're going to see more and more of this in boring industrial companies, in consumer products companies, uh and the like. So so this is the next theme to pay attention to, not to discount the benefits and and the NVIDIAs of the world will continue to do great. But to look for like where can I get doubles and triples, not incremental growth of things that have already run up.\n\n00:02:56 Speaker A\n\nBut I mean, when Mark Benioff says something like this, does it essentially signal that there is even more productivity that they can extract from the AI use cases that they're already seeing internally at their companies and the number of other major software companies out there that are trying to do the same thing while also selling solutions to their customer base.\n\n00:03:56 Thomas Hayes\n\nLook, when Mark Benioff talks, you have to listen, okay? And if he's doing it in his own company, guess what the next step is. He's going to be doing it for all the other consumers, the clients of Salesforce and helping them to become more productive. But on in the short term, it looks like a panic. It's like, oh, everyone's going to lose their job. In the long term, what we know is all these new technologies create new cottage industries, create new jobs, create new opportunities. So in the short term there is some dislocation, increase productivity for sure. In the intermediate and long term, it creates new industries, it creates new servicing, it creates new things that we don't even know that we don't know. Uh and that's just the beauty of progress.\n\n00:05:04 Speaker A\n\nNext up here, I want to talk about cryptocurrency exchange Kraken announcing a peer-to-peer payment app, putting it in competition with Block owned Cash App and PayPal owned Venmo. We're seeing those stocks edge lower on this news and this new platform will allow transfers of crypto and fiat currencies in an effort to further expand Kraken's business to more than just digital asset trading here. I think this directly speaks to how much of the mindset among the not even just the crypto curious, but the crypto core out there that are holders and holders of crypto long-term that have already recognized how much they engage with some of the newer platforms like a Kraken versus some of the legacy platforms. Yes, we can call them legacy at this point in PayPal and in uh of course Square or Block. Um\n\n00:06:57 Thomas Hayes\n\nLook, this is just a headline. Okay, Crack Kraken, I mean, uh Cash App is a lower quality business. Block is a lower quality business. PayPal is a superlative business. We own PayPal. 453 million users, they're generating record free cash flow, they're buying in 20% of their stock. By the way, they're the sixth largest issuer of stable coins. So they are in the game. They just announced the deal with the Big 12 where the players are going to take their their payments uh uh through PayPal, through Venmo. That's going to create a and you're going to get your team cards, team credit cards, team bonuses. That's going to create a lot of buzz around the millennials and and around the Gen Z. So yes, Kraken's getting in the game, but no, they don't have 450 million active users, two decades of brand equity, uh comfort, uh etc. and Alex Chris who ran uh the business division for into it, which was a monster multibagger. He's applying his innovation to small business at PayPal. It's just early days for the new PayPal since he's come in in just over a year.\n\n00:08:58 Speaker A\n\nFinally here, we got to talk CoreWeave. CoreWeave CEO is now among one of the richest executives in the world after the company's meteoric 300% surge. CoreWeave is now one of the 30 best performing stocks on the Nasdaq since its public offering. Taking a look at shares here, adding on about 7/10s, 8/10s of a percent in a move higher here on the day. But if you were to fire up the Yahoo Finance platform and go towards a longer term look since this company went public and this is not even factoring in the day one pop, I don't think, 302% moved to the upside and that happened just earlier this year as well. And so this really getting us back into the mind frame of what the appetite for investors and the clamoring among investors for new names who can show profitability or show a pathway towards getting to sustain profitability making their market debut is actually is right now.\n\n00:10:16 Thomas Hayes\n\nYeah, look, there's pent up demand and uh Wall Street's very good when the ducks are quack and you feed them. So right now, CoreWeave is the only place to put your money if you want to get some of this action. Uh in the next few months you're going to see dozens and dozens and dozens of opportunities that dilute the CoreWeaves of the world, which is a GPU reseller. Uh and uh and you're going to see uh um a little bit more moderation in those those price increases.\n\n00:11:05 Speaker A\n\nThe ducks are quacking, you feed them. All right, cool.

See the full list for free.\n\nSalesforce’s announcement of Agentforce’s integration by PepsiCo and UChicago Medicine could bolster its narrative of driving AI adoption across industries. These partnerships may enhance Salesforce's operational efficiency and customer experiences, potentially leading to increased demand for its AI-driven solutions. The company's revenue and earnings forecasts could see upward revisions as these initiatives gain traction, aligning with analysts' expectations of revenue reaching $49.1 billion and earnings rising to $9.9 billion by 2028.\n\nIn the longer term, Salesforce shares delivered a 60.33% total return over the past three years. However, they underperformed the US Software industry’s 19.7% gain over the last year. This indicates a significant rebound in shareholder value after a period of challenge, although shorter-term performance suggests room for improvement.\n\nCurrently, Salesforce shares trade at US$273.36, reflecting a discount of around 30.2% to the consensus price target of US$353.19. If earnings meet projected growth rates and profit margins improve, this price target may be attainable. However, risks like competitive pressures and reliance on external partnerships exist, which could impact the forecasts and valuation assumptions. As always, it's crucial to assess these elements against your own evaluations and market expectations.\n\nReview our growth performance report to gain insights into Salesforce's future.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

He noted that networking solutions, a part of HPE's core offerings, are needed to deploy more AI and cloud applications.\n\n\"We see that growth in our orders, and now in our revenue,\" he added.\n\nNeri also pointed to continued growth in enterprise demand, particularly around AI and hybrid cloud services. He highlighted HPE's deepening partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) to expand so-called AI factories — infrastructure needed to build, deploy, and scale AI models — as a key driver for growth.\n\nBut the view from CIOs may be more cautious. According to a new report from KeyBanc Capital Markets, IT budget expectations have slipped. The firm now forecasts IT budgets to grow just 2.7% in 2025, down from 3.9% at the start of the year. If that holds, it would mark the slowest IT budget growth period since 2020.\n\nThe firm noted broader restraint in the sector. Software vendors are seeing increased scrutiny, and IT hiring plans have scaled back. Major tech employers like Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Salesforce (CRM) have reduced headcounts following a post-pandemic hiring spree. In March, HPE announced a cost-cutting plan targeting $350 million in savings by 2027, primarily through workforce reductions.\n\nTariff-related uncertainty has also weighed on IT. While KeyBanc initially expected 33% of CIOs to say they are being impacted, 42% now report a negative effect. Still, only 19% said they’ve delayed spending, suggesting companies are cautious but not pulling back entirely.\n\nHPE beat Wall Street's expectations in its fiscal second quarter, with revenue of $7.6 billion, up 6% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.38, down 10% year over year. Its intelligent edge segment, which includes networking, had a 7% jump in revenue compared to the prior year, and the hybrid cloud segment grew 13%.\n\nThe company's pressured server business was responsible for the bulk of its sales at $4.1 billion, a 6% increase over the prior year.\n\nMeanwhile, HPE is facing a lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its proposed $14 billion Juniper Networks (JNPR) acquisition, with a trial set to begin on July 9. HPE first announced the deal in January 2024.

The platform includes a newly introduced Command Center that allows businesses to monitor agent performance at scale, support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) to ensure seamless deployment across systems, and over 100 prebuilt industry-specific actions tailored for faster results.

Over the years, Salesforce has built a strong and interconnected platform. The acquisition of Informatica, Zoomin and Own Company shows its intent to move beyond its position as a CRM software maker and become a broader enterprise software provider focused on artificial intelligence (AI), data and collaboration.\n\nAI is now central to Salesforce’s growth plan. Since rolling out Einstein GPT in 2023, the company has embedded generative AI into its platform to help businesses automate processes, improve decisions and offer better customer experiences. As AI adoption rises across industries, Salesforce is well-placed to benefit from the same.\n\nIts latest innovation, Agentforce, reflects that momentum. Paired with its Data Cloud, Agentforce has already hit $100 million in annualized revenues just two quarters after launch. More than 4,000 customers are using it for various tasks in sales, service and marketing. Data Cloud is also expanding fast, with annual recurring revenues growing more than 120% year over year. Salesforce’s broader strategy of bringing apps, data and AI agents under one umbrella gives it a strong edge.\n\nHowever, Salesforce’s biggest challenge right now is slowing sales growth. For years, the company has delivered double-digit revenue increases. However, that pace has now cooled to single digits. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues rose just 7.7% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew by only 5.7%.\n\nSalesforce Inc.

We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Salesforce. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Salesforce's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNYSE:CRM Earnings and Revenue Growth June 25th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.

Furthermore, CEO Marc Benioff is the owner of 2.3% of the company's shares.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:43:40.422511+00:00"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nSalesforce is working to mitigate key agentic AI adoption hurdles around governance in its latest upgrades to the Agentforce platform , the company said Monday .\n\nAgentforce 3 includes a command center that supports Model Context Protocol, an interoperability standard. The offering is built into Agentforce Studio and aims to help enterprise customers monitor, measure and optimize AI agents. Via dashboards, enterprises can track agent adoption, feedback, success rates and costs.\n\nThe Agentforce architecture got a boost, too, with expanded model options, automatic model failover capabilities, lower latency and greater accuracy, according to Salesforce . The vendor also added more than 100 pre-built “industry actions” for agents, such as patient scheduling, vehicle servicing and advertising proposal generation.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAt less than a year old, Salesforce’s Agentforce is already entering its third iteration as the vendor looks to encourage enterprise adoption.\n\n“As [customers] deploy more and more agents, they need to be able to measure their efficacy. They need them to play well with other technologies in their stack,” Sanjna Parulekar, SVP of product marketing at Salesforce, said during a press conference Monday.\n\nSalesforce plans to continue building agent management tools as part of its product roadmap.\n\nInteroperability plays a key role in the strategy, too, executives said Monday. In addition to supporting the MCP standard, the software vendor has aligned with a broad industry push for shared agent protocols.\n\nThe company unveiled an agentic marketplace, called AgentExchange, as part of Agentforce 3. Using open standards like MCP and Agent2Agent, customers can access a variety of agents from 30-plus partners that can interact, communicate and collaborate directly with each other.\n\n“If you’re going to have agents do things across your business, they need to be able to connect to all the same kinds of systems that a human can do to complete that task,” Salesforce AI EVP and GM Adam Evans said.\n\nThe promises of Agentforce continue to intrigue enterprises. Salesforce said 8,000 customers signed up in the past six months to deploy the platform, but the company did not respond to questions about how many customers had moved from pilots into production.\n\nPepsiCo is one of the more recent enterprises to deploy Agentforce and “one of the first major food and beverage companies” to do so, the companies announced Tuesday.\n\nThe partnership with Salesforce is the latest step toward PepsiCo’s agentic aspirations, following yearslong investments in digital transformation and progress on cloud and data goals.\n\nThe food and beverage giant has already begun to deploy Agentforce as part of its customer service operations in the Americas and is prepping for a wider rollout to other regions and departments in 2026, according to Athina Kanioura, the company’s EVP and chief strategy and transformation officer.\n\n“Our plan is to have one common orchestration layer that we can use to manage the agents,” Kanioura told CIO Dive Tuesday.\n\nUpskilling for employees who will work side by side agents, as well as for managers who will be in charge of the technology, is ongoing. “We are going through a massive certification process,” Kanioura said.\n\nThere’s also a team rethinking processes to adapt to a network of physical and digital agents and facilitate seamless execution. “Having the right qualifications, the right governance and the right processes to govern this ecosystem is important,” Kanioura said.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:43:53.951305+00:00"}

The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 7.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.77 per share, indicating a change of +8.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $11.3 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.8%. This estimate has changed +1.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.56 indicates a change of +11.2% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:43:55.935705+00:00"}

Currently, it sits at a $330 billion valuation; however, its revenue and profits are dramatically smaller than those of every company around it. As a result, I won't be surprised if these three companies are larger than it within the next three years.\n\nThe three stocks are Advance Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%), Salesforce (CRM -0.53%), and ASML (ASML 2.81%). All of these companies have strong growth cases but are also much larger than Palantir from a revenue and profit viewpoint. I think these three will be larger than Palantir by 2028, but there's another reason why this trio should be valued at a higher level by then as well.\n\nPalantir's financials are much different than this trio\n\nPalantir is an AI-first data analytics company that gives its users actionable insights based on the information that's run through its platform. Palantir started as a government-serving entity but expanded beyond that client base to the commercial side. That transition went extremely well, with both client bases making up a significant chunk of Palantir's revenue.\n\nPalantir has become one of the more hyped-up AI stocks, and it rose to a sky-high valuation that normally isn't seen with companies with the level of growth that it has.\n\nPalantir's market cap of $330 billion is much larger than AMD's ($206 billion), Salesforce's ($248 billion), or ASML's ($300 billion). However, all three of these companies produce much higher revenue and profits than Palantir.\n\nFrom a revenue standpoint, Palantir is about 1/10 of the size of this trio, and depending on which company it's compared to, anywhere from a fourth of the profits up to about 1/20 of the profits. So, why is Palantir valued as highly as this trio? After all, AMD, ASML, and Salesforce are all key competitors and beneficiaries of the AI arms race.\n\nIt all comes down to how much the market believes these stocks will grow over the next few years.\n\nPalantir's growth is about the same as ASML's and AMD's\n\nPalantir put up impressive growth over the past few quarters, including 39% growth in Q1 and projected growth of 38% in Q2. While Palantir has been delivering impressive growth for a bit longer than some other companies, it's not the fastest-growing business on this list.\n\nHowever, it's unlikely that ASML or AMD can keep up these elevated growth rates for the long term, which is why Palantir has a premium attached to the stock.\n\nFrom a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio standpoint, Palantir is valued at a massive premium to these other companies.\n\nPalantir deserves somewhat of a premium based on its strong growth and large runway, but 112 times sales is absurd. Few companies have ever achieved that valuation, and if a company has it, it most likely doubles its revenue quarter after quarter. Palantir isn't even close to that.\n\nAt most, I'd assign Palantir a 40 times sales premium, as any time a software company's growth rate is less than its P/S ratio (besides fully mature companies that have achieved maximum profitability), it's very expensive. Palantir is way over this threshold, which is why I think there's pain to come in the future.\n\nWhile AMD, ASML, and Salesforce are great investments in their own right, they will be larger stocks than Palantir in three years because I expect Palantir's stock to return to Earth. When that occurs, those three will rightfully be larger than Palantir based solely on how much money they generate as a business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:43:57.507411+00:00"}

UiPath focuses on robotic process automation (RPA), leveraging artificial intelligence to automate repetitive business processes and enhance operational efficiency across various industries.\n\nWhile Palantir empowers strategic decision-making through advanced analytics, UiPath streamlines workflows, making both essential players in the evolving AI ecosystem.\n\nPLTR: AIP Adoption Ignites Commercial Growth\n\nPalantir Technologies is experiencing explosive growth driven by the rapid adoption of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which has quickly become its most powerful engine for commercial expansion. In the first quarter of 2025, AIP significantly propelled U.S. commercial revenues, which soared 71% year over year and 19% sequentially. This strong performance pushed the company past a $1 billion annual run rate in U.S. commercial sales for the first time.\n\nThe momentum is also reflected in the total contract value of the commercial segment, which surged 239% YoY. Deal sizes have grown meaningfully, with the number of contracts worth over $1 million more than doubling compared to the previous year.\n\nA key driver of this adoption is the popularity of Palantir’s AIP bootcamps, short, focused training programs that help customers rapidly onboard and deploy AIP within their organizations. These bootcamps enable clients to quickly implement production-grade AI workflows, dramatically reducing time-to-value and showcasing AIP’s simplicity and real-world applicability.\n\nPalantir’s AIP empowers enterprises to deploy autonomous AI agents that not only speed up decision-making but also multiply productivity gains. Unlike peers focused on building AI models, Palantir is dominating the application layer, delivering practical, enterprise-ready AI systems that deliver measurable value from day one.

The signs made her realize that most CIOs don’t live in “hot hubs” of technology: While many are seen as their enterprise’s resident tech expert, they themselves are still playing catch-up as tech evolves at a rapid clip.\n\n“They are all at different and varying degrees of maturity,” Ahuja, Salesforce’s SVP of enterprise IT strategy, told CIO Upside. “And what I’ve really learned is we’ve got a responsibility to help educate CIOs along the way.”\n\nCIO Upside sat down with Ahuja to discuss the importance of executive AI education in change management, how to stay adaptable and how enterprises can find real value in their tech investments. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nGenerally, what do you think enterprises are getting right – or getting wrong – in their approaches to AI?\n\nI think what they’re getting right is the enthusiasm. The recognition that this is not a fad, and that this is something that I’m hearing more and more CIOs consider how to embed within their strategy. Interestingly, I’m seeing not just CIOs engaging on this topic, but I’ve actually been speaking to a number of CFOs and CEOs. I’ve never seen a technical advancement where the board is putting pressure on the CIO, and that can be seen as a positive or a negative.\n\nWhere I’m seeing opportunities for organizations to do a little better is managing this panic versus paralysis. The panic … is leading to proof of concepts. It’s leading to singular use cases. The challenge is, when they’re trying to scale it, they’re recognizing, “Oh wait, this is very expensive to scale,” or “This is not embedded within our workflow. It’s something that’s been built that sits on the side.”\n\nLargely, the industry has been moving beyond conventional generative AI toward agents. What challenges do you see enterprises face in the adoption and deployment of this tech?\n\nMy day job is literally just to meet with CIOs. And what I’m discovering is the bigger the organization, the harder it is for a CIO to know everything about everything in the tech space. What they’re hearing around autonomous and agentic is what they’re reading in articles. So I think that education is the starting point … Educating CIOs in such a way that you are not hurting their egos is, I think, very important.\n\nI wonder how many CIOs are now having to wear this hat of not just understanding and deploying this technology as fast as they can because their boards are telling them to, but how many of them are also having to get educated on it themselves and educate the organization? I think that a big component of organizational readiness starts with education and a baseline of knowledge.\n\nUpfront Cost\n\nWhy is scaling beyond single use cases so difficult?\n\nYou can either say, “I’m going to carve out a team over here, and they’re just going to be focused on this proof of concept,” or alternatively, you could say, “I want to build a proof of concept that is embedded within my production environment.” That’s often a bit more expensive up front, but less expensive on day two, because it’s not something that you built outside and have to embed. With the proof of concept, it’s cheaper to stand it up and do it, but then to implement it, you almost have to break it apart again to reimplement it. I think that’s what’s making it tricky.\n\nLet’s talk a bit about Salesforce’s Agentic Maturity Model, which suggests four levels of autonomy and responsibility. What key steps do you think enterprises need to take to graduate from one step to the next?\n\nIronically, as a tech leader, I go back to the business outcomes that we are driving, not the shiny object that we are deploying. Deploying something in production doesn’t make it successful; the adoption, the consumption and the outcomes are what make it successful. To jump from one level to another, you want to look at where you’re getting incremental business value. The second one is around data readiness. To move from one level to another, there’s a dependency on having the data available, clean, safe and trusted to be able to shift. And third is really just around having the technologies available.\n\nArchitect for your single use case now, but know that it’s a gradual build. And you don’t have to invest in all that technology immediately. Start with something that is adding value, and then build and then grow gradually over time.\n\nAgentic Coworkers\n\nWith the increased autonomy and access that agentic AI calls for, how does Salesforce approach data security and governance? How should enterprises approach this?\n\nThey should approach it as their starting point. Data security, governance, and another one is data quality. I think folks are recognizing the importance of clean, trusted, secure, and high quality data. It’s the underlying machine to absolutely everything. Agents, yes they’re in the limelight, but data cloud, as far as I’m concerned, is our Trojan horse.\n\nWhen people start to recognize or think about agents as humans, as our coworkers … they provision (data) access. Just because I’m smart enough to do every job under the sun, I shouldn’t have access to all of that data. I think that we have to start thinking about agents in the same way. Just because you can code an agent to do everything you want to under the sun, you still need to be mindful of separation of duties.\n\nI think having comfort and confidence that you are provisioning data to an agent, through guardrails, through security, through governance, that is embedded within whatever solution you choose … I think that becomes paramount.\n\nWhere should the line be drawn with AI agent implementation in the enterprise? What tasks shouldn’t AI be responsible for?\n\nI came from banking, so the idea of getting a single agent into production was a daunting task, because you needed legal, privacy, compliance, my aunt and my uncle to sign off. It was wild. I think in that case, there’s almost nothing that you’d have an agent do. So I think the degree of comfort of what an agent should or should not do, it still comes down to the industry that you are in and the degree of regulatory oversight and the governance of it. I think that there isn’t a one-answer-fits-all to this question.\n\nWhat you need to feel comfortable when deploying agents is, ironically, the human side. It’s a greater amount of empathy. Technology, I think, is forcing roles to change. It’s changing the way we look at how our colleagues are engaged, how we are engaging our customers … We need to be more mindful of how we are designing agents, to be mindful of the human experience.\n\nA common issue that enterprises face as they adopt AI is getting a return on their investments. How can organizations start to see real value, and are agents a part of that picture?\n\nWhen I was in my old seat seven months ago, it was hard for me to fathom saying “Hey, CFO, trust me. I need a bunch of money to upgrade my tech stack, and I know we’re gonna get returns.” The tech approach is to say, “In order to achieve the target state of the future, which sometimes is hard to quantify, we need all of this technology.” So I changed that entirely. I said,\n\n“I’m going to start with the ultimate outcomes of the business.” What has my CEO outlined as our strategic imperatives as a company?\n\nAs I go down to every single line of the business, we broke it down into business use cases that we quantify. Instead of technology, we focused on the outcomes that we want to drive. We broke those outcomes down into business use cases. What we did was we invested in technology and consumption of that technology anchored specifically to a use case. And we deemed a use case good if you could actually quantify it.\n\nWhat does the future of agentic AI look like?\n\nA customer once asked me a somewhat similar question, but the question was being asked in the context of, “What tech should I be investing in today?” Instead of spending time predicting what the future is going to look like in a technology that is so big and so real and so new, I would focus energy on how you can increase your AQ. There’s IQ, there’s EQ, AQ – adaptability quotient. How are you building technology stacks that will allow you to pivot? How are you building modular? How are you investing in technology that will allow you to be interoperable, that will allow you to adjust and move with the technology that I can’t predict? You’ll get caught up in not making a decision if you’re trying to anticipate what the future is.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:44:05.355354+00:00"}

Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are three tech titans set to benefit from AI.  Palantir and Salesforce are two leading software companies that have big AI opportunities ahead.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/22/10-no-brainer-industry-stocks-to-buy-right-now/", "published_at": "2025-06-22T08:30:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world we live in, making it a must-invest sector.\n\nLet's look at 10 AI stocks to invest in right now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe king of AI, Nvidia's (NVDA 0.58%) graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure due to their fast processing speeds. However, it's the company's CUDA software platform that has helped create a wide moat for the company. CUDA lets developers easily program its chips, while it's also built a collection of tools and libraries to optimize its GPUs to run AI tasks. In Q1, the company had a whopping 92% market share in the GPU space. As AI infrastructure continues to ramp up, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue benefiting.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nWhile a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%) has become a leader in central processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center. The company has also been able to carve out a niche for its GPUs with AI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models and where costs are a more important consideration. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than training, AMD has a big opportunity in front of it, even if it only takes some modest market share away from Nvidia.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom (AVGO 2.94%) has been seeing strong momentum with its networking portfolio, which is becoming more valuable as AI clusters grow in size and require more high-throughput, low-latency interconnects. However, its biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips, where the company is starting to help customers develop their own custom chips to handle specific AI workloads. After successfully helping Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), it's been adding more custom chip customers. It sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027, and that doesn't even include new customers like Apple. This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom.\n\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nWhile the above three companies design advanced AI chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is the one they hire to actually make them. As such, it benefits no matter who becomes the biggest AI chip winner. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have set it apart in the foundry space, as rivals have struggled. This has led the company to become an invaluable cog in the semiconductor supply chain. With growing manufacturing capacity and strong pricing power, TSMC is very well positioned to benefit from growing AI chip demand.\n\n5. ASML\n\nWhile TSMC manufactures advanced chips, ASML (ASML 2.81%) is the company that makes the machines that make it possible to produce these chips. It has a virtual monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is the equipment used in advanced chip manufacturing. It also introduced its next-generation technology, high-NA (numerical aperture) EUV, that will allow for higher density chips. While TSMC has balked at the high price ($400 million) of these new machines, it cannot afford to get bypassed on the technological front by a competitor like Intel. As such, ASML should be a long-term winner as foundries continue to increase capacity and start looking toward even more advanced nodes (smaller, more powerful chips).\n\n6. Amazon\n\nWhile best known for its e-commerce business, Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) is also the largest cloud computing company in the world. In fact, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is its largest segment by profitability and its fastest growing, as it benefits from helping customers build their own AI models and apps and run them on its cloud infrastructure. The company is investing heavily in new data center infrastructure to keep up with AI demand. In addition, Amazon is using AI throughout its e-commerce operations to make its business more efficient and reduce costs. This combination bodes well for Amazon being a long-term AI winner.\n\n7. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is also a cloud computing giant, where it is benefiting from many of the same trends as Amazon. As an added benefit, Google Cloud just hit an inflection point, with its profitability now beginning to soar. While there is some worry about the impact of AI on its core Google search business, the company is embracing the technology and doing what it does best: connecting consumers with merchants. Meanwhile, the advantages that Alphabet's strong distribution and entrenched ad network give it should not be underestimated.\n\n8. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (META 3.16%) has been at the forefront of AI with its Llama large language model (LLM). The company is using AI to both keep users more engaged on its social media apps, as well as help advertisers create better campaigns and more precisely target potential customers. This is leading to more ad inventory and higher ad prices, since its ads are becoming more effective. In addition, the company has just started serving ads on its popular WhatsApp messaging app, and it is building out a new social media site, Threads. This should provide the company with a solid runway of growth ahead.\n\n9. Palantir\n\nInstead of building out its own models, Palantir Technologies (PLTR 2.30%) has taken a different approach to AI, essentially looking to become the orchestration layer, or operating system, for the technology. It does this by gathering data from a wide array of sources and structuring it into an ontology that connects digital assets with their real-world counterparts. This then allows its customers to use its platform to solve complex, real-world problems through the use of AI. The platform can be used for numerous applications across industries, which means Palantir has a huge opportunity ahead.\n\n10. Salesforce\n\nAfter bringing the software-as-service (SaaS) model to the mainstream, Salesforce (CRM -0.53%) is now looking to become the leader in agentic AI, where AI agents will go out and perform tasks with little to no human interaction. The company is looking to help create a digital workforce by tightly integrating its Agentforce platform, Data Cloud solution, apps, and metadata framework. Together, it believes this will allow agents to better understand customer intent and perform tasks more effectively. As a consumption-based solution, AI agents are a huge opportunity for the company.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:44:09.066206+00:00"}

One of the best ways to find bargains in a hot sector is to look beyond stocks' price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and instead look at their price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios, as this metric takes into consideration their earnings growth.\n\nStocks with PEGs under 1 are generally considered undervalued, and based on this metric, five of the best values in the AI space are Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%), Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), Salesforce (CRM -0.53%), Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), and Adobe (ADBE 1.43%).\n\nLet's look at why these bargain AI stocks could be great buys.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (forward PEG 0.2)\n\nWith a forward PEG of only 0.2 based on its projected 2026 growth, AMD is one of the cheapest stocks in the AI space -- if it can live up to its growth expectations. The company has already been seeing solid growth, with its overall revenue climbing by 36% last quarter to $7.44 billion, while its data center segment revenue surged 57% to $3.7 billion.\n\nThe growth is being led by the company's strong positioning within server central processing units (CPUs) and solid growth from its graphics processing units (GPUs). The former acts as the brain for computers, while the latter provides the processing power. While the market for CPUs is not nearly as robust as the one for GPUs in the data center space, it is still a nice, growing market, and AMD has been taking share.\n\nHowever, the company's biggest opportunity will come when the AI market shifts from training more toward inference, which is expected to eventually be the much larger market. Inference is less technically demanding than training AI models, and things such as latency, power consumption, and cost come much more into play. This should allow AMD to take some market share in the GPU space, which would fuel a lot of growth moving forward.\n\nBroadcom (forward PEG 0.4)\n\nBroadcom is another cheap chip stock with a big opportunity in front of it. The company is seeing solid growth, with revenue jumping 25% last quarter to $14.9 billion, led by a 70% surge in its networking revenue. However, it is its foray into custom AI chips that has the potential to really drive growth higher.\n\nThe company has seen strong success with its first custom AI chip customer, Alphabet, which has led to it winning additional customers. It sees its three furthest-along custom AI chip customers being a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market opportunity in its fiscal year 2027 (ending October 2027). If it can capture much of this opportunity, then the stock has a lot of potential upside from here. Notably, that number does not include more recent custom chip customer wins, including Apple.\n\nWith a PEG of around 0.4 based on fiscal 2026 earnings, Broadcom has some serious upside potential. The biggest risk for it, as well as AMD, would be a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending.\n\nSalesforce (forward PEG of 0.5)\n\nGiven their recurring revenue model, software-as-as-service (SaaS) stocks typically trade at premium valuations, but that is not currently the case with Salesforce. With a forward PEG of around 0.5, the stock is in the bargain bin.\n\nHowever, the company has strong data-center and AI opportunities ahead. It's been seeing strong momentum with its Data Cloud solution, which helps customers unify their data into a single source, while it is also looking to be an agentic AI leader with its Agentforce platform. Last quarter, its Data Cloud annual recurring revenue (ARR) soared 120% year over year to more than $1 billion, while its Agentforce platform reached ARR of $100 million after only being launched last fall.\n\nThe company is looking to tightly integrate Data Cloud and Agentforce with its apps, such as Tableau and Slack, to help spark a new era of digital labor. Meanwhile, it recently introduced a new flexible Agentforce consumption-based pricing model more aligned with outcomes to increase customer satisfaction and drive adoption.\n\nWhile there is always a risk its strategy will not work, at its current valuation, there is not much downside if it doesn't and a lot of upside if it does.\n\nNvidia (forward PEG of 0.7)\n\nIt's sometimes hard to believe investors can get the preeminent AI growth stock at a forward PEG of only 0.7 times. However, based on fiscal 2026 projections, that's Nvidia's current valuation. The company has grown its data center revenue ninefold over the past two years, and more growth is ahead.\n\nWhile competitors are trying to make inroads, Nvidia is still the dominant market share leader when it comes to AI chips. It had an incredible 92% market share in the GPU space in Q1. Nvidia's secret sauce remains its CUDA software platform, which it developed to help expand the use of its chips beyond their original purpose of speeding up graphics rendering in video games. It has since layered a collection of libraries and tools on top of CUDA that enhance the performance of its chips in AI tasks.\n\nNvidia's newest chips remain in high demand, and the company is well positioned to continue to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the current AI data center buildout. An AI infrastructure spending slowdown is a risk, but the stock is far from being priced for perfection, giving it solid upside potential from here.\n\nAdobe (forward PEG of 0.8)\n\nAdobe isn't a high-growth stock, but with a PEG of 0.8, it's fallen into the category of growth at a reasonable price (GARP). While AI isn't helping accelerate revenue growth, it has helped it settle in a nice, high-single-digit, low-double-digit range.\n\nThe company is using AI to help drive results within its creative software solutions, as well as its products aimed more toward business professionals. At the heart of its strategy is its Firefly generative AI model. Using just natural language prompts, FireFly can help users generate images, video, audio, and vector content that they can further manipulate with Adobe's creative tools, such as Photoshop, all while ensuring intellectual property protection. Document Cloud and Express have also incorporated FireFly into their platform and can handle everything from summarizing documents in Document Cloud to text-to-video generation in Express.\n\nAll in all, the stock is inexpensive, and it looks like AI should continue to help power Adobe's results moving forward.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:44:10.787761+00:00"}

But, my next guest has some alternative ways to play artificial intelligence. I'm going to bring in Dan Newman who is the Futurum CEO. Great to have you here back in studio with us.\n\n00:15 Dan Newman\n\nHey Brad, good to see you.\n\n00:17 Speaker A\n\nSo, let's talk about this because a lot of people have already piled into Mag 7, but you believe that there are other places that are non Mag 7 that they could find some exposure to generative AI and this broader kind of thesis that's driven the market for the past two years.\n\n00:30 Dan Newman\n\nYeah, I mean there's been nothing that has, you know, deemed more attention than AI. You've seen just the news in the last couple of days, whether it's Microsoft wanting to, or sorry, meta offering hundreds of millions of dollars to potential researchers to join their AI talent team. Or, you know, you saw Marvell came out yesterday with the custom AI Silicon roadmap and their stock is popping, we'll probably talk a little bit about that. Um, but you're seeing it really across the board. And then of course so many people have kind of felt like, well, did I miss Nvidia? And so the the question I get asked most by, you know, by clients, by the by retail investors and why we basically launched the Futurum AI 15, which is the extended list beyond is what else is out there besides maybe Nvidia, Microsoft, and meta? What are the plays, you know? And so, you hear about kind of what are the difference difference makers? So for instance, uh, companies like Avago, you know, Broadcom. Um, you know there's a $500 billion TAM, we believe, in the next four years for custom AI Silicon.\n\n01:52 Speaker A\n\nYeah.\n\n01:53 Dan Newman\n\nUm, Nvidia's going to get a lot of that, you know, Nvidia gets 92% of that market right now, we believe. Right. But they're not going to keep 92% in our opinion. They're probably going to fall to maybe 80%, 70%. So it still means Nvidia, by the way, can triple to $300 billion. There's going to be $100 billion that's going to go into custom. And so we have Avago, for instance, at as our number two name to play, because that $100 billion opportunity, that sits with the Google custom chips they're doing, sits with custom chips that companies like Open AI are planning to do. So that's one of the plays. Of course, you're seeing, uh, Brad, TSMC. TSMC, you know, people think about it as a foundry, and of course, it's a very big name and there's a lot of dollars invested in it right now, but people don't always make that connection that whether it's Nvidia making chips, meta making chips, Microsoft, and Amazon doing their custom chips, all of them are dependent right now on TSMC. And as much as I think the US needs a strong Intel, we aren't there yet. So, right now, TSMC has all the pricing power. So it sits at the very top of our list. And then there's some eclectic names, I'll pause here, but basically there's eclectic names like Oracle, that we put on there. You saw what a pop they've gotten, but they've absolutely nailed this AI transformation and they're in a perfect position. And just yesterday, XAI and Oracle made a big announcement together that they're going to be using X Oracle's infrastructure to train XAI models.\n\n04:11 Speaker A\n\nRight.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:44:25.459875+00:00"}

Chandrasekaran expects vendors to continue to iterate away from traditional models, especially as more work happens outside the purview of a human being.\n\n“They’re trying to introduce these new pricing models to really figure out how they can meet customer expectations,” Chandrasekaran said. “CIOs today have a very unique opportunity to ensure that the software that they’re paying for is delivering true business value.”\n\nEnterprises have a few weeks to recalculate for higher bills or find alternative services as the Salesforce August deadline approaches.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:44:29.273070+00:00"}
