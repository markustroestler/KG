Credit: Liverpool FC via Getty Images.\n\nWhen attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz arrived at Liverpool Football Club from Bayer Leverkusen to the sound of jubilant supporters this summer, few anticipated that the transfer would cause concern at big pharma Bayer.\n\nBayer – a German drugmaker that owns compatriot football club Bayer Leverkusen – reported better-than-expected Q2 results last week. Operating income came in at €2.1bn ($2.43bn) for the company, fuelled apparently by strong growth in its pharmaceutical portfolio.\n\nHowever, a more detailed Q2 earnings report released on 6 August revealed that the results included revenue from players sold at Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nIn its Q2 report, Bayer wrote: “In the reconciliation, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation (EBITDA) before special items increased against the prior-year period, largely thanks to higher revenue from player transfers at Bayer 04 Leverkusen Fußball GmbH.”\n\nA Bayer spokesperson declined to add further information after Pharmaceutical Technology’s request, saying only the player transfers “helped improve this figure”.\n\nDespite a positive Q2 report that also included Bayer raising its 2025 sales outlook, investors were downbeat after the disclosure. Shares in the company closed 8% down at €24.98 on 6 August compared to the market open.\n\nGlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?

By GlobalData Learn more about Strategic Intelligence\n\nThere was also a lukewarm reception to in-depth analysis of its pharma segment, which showed that the 0.6% growth came more from a slower decline in sales of off-patent anticoagulant Xarelto (rivaroxaban). Investors usually hope that growth in newer products, with longer patent protection, will further fuel revenue.\n\n“The detail of the beat being somewhat related to Xarelto and the sale of a footballer could be disappointing to some,” JP Morgan analysts wrote in a note sent to Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nLeverkusen have permanently sold a total of six players in the summer transfer window for fees, according to Transfermarkt. The highest by far was Wirtz’s transfer to Liverpool FC for a British-record fee of €136.3m in June. The deal structure includes €117.5m upfront for the player, meaning Leverkusen receive that immediately. Other deals include Jeremie Frimpong – also to Liverpool FC – for €40m in May and Odilon Kossounon transferred for €20m in June.\n\nGerman football league rules dictate that fan members maintain majority ownership and control of their clubs. Bayer’s ownership of Leverkusen goes back to 1904, when the club was established, predating voting rights rules. It is unclear how much of Leverkusen’s profits funnel back to Bayer.\n\nJP Morgan analysts specifically highlighted the Wirtz transfer driving lower reconciliation costs, which came in at an EBITDA of €13m, €106m better than consensus.\n\nDespite the noise around player transfers inflating earnings, there were distinct growth points for Bayer’s newly launched drugs. Prostate cancer therapy Nubeqa (darolutamide) grew 50.5% to €546m, while Kerendia (finerenone) stretched sales by 67.1% to €183m.\n\nSeparately, Bayer announced it has now cut 12,000 full-time positions since the start of its restructuring programme designed to save €2bn by 2026.\n\nSign up for our daily news round-up!

Panellists Prasun Mishra, founding director of Agility Pharmaceuticals, and Naymisha Patel, senior vice-president of Tenaya Therapeutics, will explore how the sector is navigating issues related to regulations, sustainability, and AI.\n\nIn addition to companies such as Alynlam Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, and Denali Therapeutics, representatives from US Customs and Border Protection will also be participating throughout the conference.\n\nThe first day’s sessions will be split into two streams focused on clinical supply logistics and operations, and clinical supply technology and innovation. Kicking off the former will be a talk on data analytics and flexibility for risk management and forecasting by Rachael Pierce, senior clinical trial supply manager at Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals.\n\nForecasting and risk management are at the forefront of discussions in the sector amidst Trump’s newly imposed tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. First proposed by the President in April, a 15% rate was agreed upon for imports from the European Union (EU) late last month while talks with other regions continue to take place. On 5 August, Trump further said tariff rates on drug imports from the EU could go as high as 250%.\n\nGlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?

The morning will also see a keynote session on regulatory guidelines and quality assurance by Patel, and another on ensuring supply chains incorporate patient experience by patient advocate Christine von Raesfeld.\n\nClosing the day is a roundup of the wider biopharma industry trends and emerging technologies, and opportunities in 2025, which will be given by Amanda Murphy, senior director of data intelligence and solutions at GlobalData. Considering the rising growth in initiatives related to environmental, social and governance (ESG), the conference will end with an interactive discussion on environmental sustainability in clinical trial supply chains.\n\nThe conference is hosted by Arena International Events Group, a B2B events company owned by GlobalData, the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.

These candidates were being developed for cerebral cavernous malformation, neurofibromatosis type II and Clostridioides difficile infection, respectively.\n\nRXRX shares have lost 16% year to date against the industry’s 0.5% growth.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFollowing the terminations, Recursion Pharmaceuticals shifted focus to more promising candidates, notably REC-4881, which is being evaluated in a phase Ib/II TUPELO study for familial adenomatous polyposis. In May 2025, the company reported preliminary data from this study, with additional data expected in the second half of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, Recursion Pharmaceuticals initiated its phase I/II DAHLIA study of REC-1245, a new chemical entity for the treatment of biomarker-enriched solid tumors and lymphoma. Data readout from the phase I portion of the DAHLIA study is expected in the first half of 2026. Recursion Pharmaceuticals is also developing a few other candidates, like REC-617 (advanced solid tumors) and REC-3565 (B-cell malignancies), in separate early-stage studies.\n\nIn July 2025, Recursion Pharmaceuticals acquired Rallybio’s full stake in their joint venture for developing REV102 and an associated backup molecule for the treatment of hypophosphatasia. REV102, a potent and selective ENPP1 inhibitor with strong preclinical safety data, is expected to enter phase I studies by late 2026.

The drug is SRPT’s one-shot gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”).\n\nSarepta stated that the voluntary pause is a proactive measure to allow sufficient time to address any information requests and to complete the Elevidys safety labeling supplement process with the FDA. SRPT expressed its commitment to a collaborative, science-based review and ongoing dialogue with the agency.\n\nThis marks yet another major setback for Sarepta, with serious implications for its revenue-generating potential. The company relies heavily on Elevidys to drive top-line growth, with the therapy contributing over half of total revenues in the first quarter of 2025. The voluntary pause in U.S. shipments is expected to significantly impact Sarepta’s financial performance in the second half of the year.\n\nSRPT Halts US Elevidys Shipments Amid Mounting Setbacks\n\nThe decision to temporarily halt U.S. shipments of Elevidys comes on the heels of the death of a patient dosed with one of its experimental gene therapies. Last week, Sarepta confirmed that a 51-year-old, non-ambulant (unable to walk) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (“LGMD”) patient died due to acute liver failure (“ALF”). The unfortunate event occurred in a phase I study of the investigational gene therapy candidate, SRP-9004, which is being developed for LGMD Type 2D.\n\nThis marked the third patient death confirmed by Sarepta from the use of its gene therapies. Earlier this year, SRPT reported two cases of patient death following treatment with Elevidys for DMD. Like the latest death, the two earlier deaths were also due to ALF and occurred in non-ambulatory patients.\n\nBased on these incidents, the FDA placed all Sarepta’s clinical studies for LGMD on hold.

The unfortunate event occurred in a phase I study of the investigational gene therapy candidate, SRP-9004, which is being developed for LGMD Type 2D.\n\nThis marks the third patient death confirmed by Sarepta from the use of its gene therapies. Earlier this year, SRPT reported two cases of patient death following treatment with Elevidys, its one-shot gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Like the latest setback, these two deaths were also due to ALF and occurred in non-ambulatory patients.\n\nBased on these events, Sarepta has suspended Elevidys dosing for non-ambulatory patients in the commercial setting and is considering an enhanced immunosuppression regimen to make the therapy safer for these patients. It has also voluntarily paused dosing in the ongoing late-stage ENVISION study designed to satisfy the regulatory requirements for Elevidys outside the United States. This study is evaluating the therapy in non-ambulatory and ambulatory DMD patients. However, the therapy has been mandated by the FDA to carry a black box warning for ALF and acute liver injury.\n\nSarepta is heavily dependent on Elevidys for revenue generation. During the first quarter of 2025, sales from the therapy accounted for over half of its top line. The safety concerns are bound to severely impact sales of the drug in the second half of the year, which will cause the company’s top line to suffer.

Eylea sales have boosted the company’s top line for many years. However, Eylea’s sales have been under pressure in the past couple of years due to competition from Roche’s RHHBY Vabysmo.\n\nThe uptake of Roche’s Vabysmo has been phenomenal. Roche has designed Vabysmo to block pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A.\n\nBiosimilar competition for Eylea is also worrisome. Since Eylea accounts for a majority of REGN’s sales, a rapid decline in sales has adversely impacted the company’s top line.\n\nTo counter the decline in Eylea sales, Regeneron has developed a higher dose of the drug. While the initial uptake of Eylea HD was encouraging as Eylea patients transitioned to the higher dose, it will take Eylea HD quite some time to offset the rapid erosion in Eylea sales.\n\nIn April 2025, the FDA accepted for priority review a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval of Eylea HD for both the treatment of macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and broadening the dosing schedule to include every 4-week (monthly) dosing across approved indications. The FDA has set a target action date of Aug. 19, 2025.\n\nHowever, the regulatory body issued a complete response letter (“CRL”) for the pre-filled syringe of Eylea HD. Per the company, the key outstanding issue relates to a question posed by the FDA to a third-party component supplier. This component supplier has expeditiously responded to FDA requests for information.\n\nThe FDA also issued a CRL regarding the sBLA for the addition of extended dosing intervals. The FDA indicated that the submitted data did not support extended dosing intervals greater than every 16 weeks.\n\nRegeneron has a collaboration agreement with Bayer BAYRY for Eylea. Regeneron records the net product sales of Eylea and Eylea HD in the United States, and Bayer records its net product sales outside the country.

Traditional biotech companies rely on a “trial-and-error” approach, leading to significant cash burn during early research and development. The high failure rates and funding challenges often result in financial instability or bankruptcy, hindering progress in the sector.\n\nHowever, Recursion Pharmaceuticals’ solid fundamentals and the promising potential of Recursion OS make us believe that the stock could deliver multi-bagger returns in the future. Let’s dig deeper and understand the company’s strengths and weaknesses in greater detail to understand how to play the stock going forward.\n\nYear to date, RXRX stock has plunged 20.3% compared with the industry’s 1.9% decline. The company has also underperformed the sector and the S&P 500 during the same time frame, as seen in the chart below.\n\nThe promising pipeline update comes on the heels of a major setback in May 2025 that had significantly shaken investor confidence in the company. Recursion Pharmaceuticals discontinued the development of three key drug candidates — REC-994, REC-2282 and REC-3964 — due to disappointing results from mid-stage studies. REC-994 and REC-2282 were being developed for cerebral cavernous malformation and neurofibromatosis type II, respectively, but showed insufficient efficacy to justify further investment. Similarly, REC-3964, for Clostridioides difficile infection, was also shelved as the company opted to focus on areas with greater unmet needs. The move was part of a broader strategic pipeline reprioritization.\n\nBy securing full ownership, Recursion Pharmaceuticals can now independently advance the program, aiming to deliver the first oral, disease-modifying treatment for HPP. Under the deal, RXRX will pay Rallybio $7.5 million upfront in equity, $12.5 million in contingent equity tied to preclinical progress, and another $5 million upon initiating dosing in an early-stage clinical study. Rallybio will also earn low single-digit royalties on future sales and may receive additional payments if the program is sold.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals RXRX shares have gained 5.5% in a month. The stock gained momentum after the company announced the acquisition of Rallybio’s full stake in their joint venture earlier this month for developing REV102 and a backup candidate for hypophosphatasia (HPP), a rare genetic disorder. The partnership, launched in 2019, leveraged Recursion Pharmaceuticals’ AI-powered Recursion OS (developed with NVIDIA) to identify ENPP1 as a therapeutic target, leading to the creation of REV102, a promising oral ENPP1 inhibitor with high potency and safety for chronic use.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn contrast, Recursion Pharmaceuticals leverages AI-powered models to test clinical compounds against a virtual library of human biology, hoping to identify promising candidates with higher probabilities of success in clinical development. This approach could reduce research costs, improve efficiency, and allow the company to deliver breakthrough therapies at lower prices. Additionally, it can generate incremental revenues by licensing its AI platform to other drug makers, as demonstrated by its collaborations with Merck, Bayer BAYRY, Sanofi SNY and Roche RHHBY. Even when candidates fail in clinical studies, Recursion Pharmaceuticals could use the resulting data to refine and enhance its AI models, improving accuracy and long-term outcomes.\n\nRXRX’s Retained Pipeline Demonstrates Potential\n\nAs part of its strategic pipeline reprioritization efforts, Recursion Pharmaceuticals has shifted its focus and resources to the development of other candidates in its clinical pipeline. Such candidates include REC-4881, which is being developed for familial adenomatous polyposis in a phase Ib/II TUPELO study. A data readout from the study is expected in the second half of 2025.\n\nBeyond REC-4881, Recursion Pharmaceuticalsis advancing other candidates to diversify and strengthen its pipeline. These include REC-1245, currently in a phase I/II DAHLIA study for biomarker-enriched solid tumors and lymphoma, with initial results anticipated in the first half of 2026. The company is also exploring REC-617 for advanced solid tumors and REC-3565 for B-cell malignancies in separate early-stage studies. The company ended first-quarter 2025 with a cash balance of $509 million, which is expected to fuel operations into mid-2027 based on its current business plan.\n\nAdditionally, Recursion Pharmaceuticalshas ongoing collaboration agreements with pharma giants like Roche, Bayer, Merck and Sanofi to develop candidates for several oncology indications with differentiated mechanisms of action. RXRX recently received $7 million in collaboration revenues from Sanofi, following the achievement of a significant discovery milestone.\n\nCompetitive Pressure and Pipeline Risks Cloud RXRX’s Outlook\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals faces intense competition from biotech firms, tech-driven drug discovery companies, and pharmaceutical giants, all leveraging computational tools and scalable platforms. Rivalry from companies like Relay Therapeutics, Isomorphic Labs, and even tech giants like Alphabet and Microsoft could challenge RXRX’s ability to differentiate itself and sustain its competitive edge.\n\nInvestors are also apprehensive of the company’s pipeline potential as its investigational candidates are still in the early stages of development and far from commercialization. There are chances that it will not have a product in the market for at least three to four years.\n\nRXRX’s Discount Valuation & Mixed Estimate Movements\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals is trading at a discount to the industry, as seen in the chart below.

Sales grew strongly across all regions, driven by exemplary growth in the United States with strong momentum from the recently launched early breast cancer (eBC) indication as well as continued share gains in the metastatic breast cancer indication.\n\nCosentyx’s sales (psoriasis, spondylitis and arthritis) increased 6% to $1.6 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.7 billion and our model estimate of $1.8 billion. The year-over-year improvement was driven by recent launches, including the hidradenitis suppurativa indication (HS) and the intravenous formulation (IV) in the United States and Europe, and volume growth in core indications.\n\nEntresto’s sales comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34 billion and our model estimate of $2.23 billion.\n\nHowever, Novartis is in litigation with a generic manufacturer and the FDA to protect its Entresto IP and regulatory rights in the United States.\n\nCardiovascular drug Entresto’s sales rose 22% from the year-ago level to $2.36 billion. The growth was driven by the heart failure indication in the United States and Europe, and both heart failure and hypertension indications in China and Japan.\n\nWith the successful spin-off of the Sandoz business in 2023, Novartis now focuses on four core therapeutic areas — cardiovascular-renal-metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology.\n\nAll growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.\n\nShares of Novartis have gained 24.5% year to date against the industry’s decline of 0.4%.\n\nHowever, shares are down in pre-market trading, most likely due to the Cosentyx sales miss and the CFO retirement news.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, sales increased 11%, driven by continued strong performance from Kisqali, Entresto, Kesimpta, Scemblix, Leqvio and Pluvicto.\n\nRevenues of $14.05 billion climbed 12% from the year-ago reported figure and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.04 billion.\n\nCore earnings (excluding one-time charges) of $2.42 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38 and were up from $1.97 reported a year ago. The year-over-year improvement was driven by strong growth in sales. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar .)\n\nSwiss pharma giant Novartis AG NVS reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter of 2025 and upped annual guidance for core operating income.\n\nStory Continues\n\nKisqali sales beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1.1 billion.\n\nKesimpta (multiple sclerosis) sales totaled $1.1 billion, which rose 33% on increased demand and strong access. The figure beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1 billion.\n\nStrong performances by Tafinlar + Mekinist (up 7% to $573 million) and Jakavi (up 8% to $524 million) also boosted the top line.\n\nHowever, Promacta sales were down 9% to $502 million due to discontinued promotion in most markets and recent generic entry in the United States in May 2025.\n\nXolair (asthma and allergies) sales grew 2% to $443 million. Sales grew slightly, driven by the chronic spontaneous urticaria indication. Novartis has a collaboration agreement with Roche RHHBY for Xolair. Novartis and Roche co-promote Xolair in the United States.\n\nIlaris sales amounted to $477 million, which increased 27% year over year, driven by growth in all regions led by the United States and Europe. Strong performance in the Periodic Fever Syndromes and Still’s disease indications also contributed to this growth.\n\nTasigna sales plunged 27% to $327 million due to lower demand and increasing competition, including the recent generic entry in the United States in May 2025.\n\nPluvicto (prostate cancer) raked in sales of $454 million, up 30% on encouraging demand uptake in the United States following the pre-taxane metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) approval, as well as expansion in the post-taxane mCRPC setting outside the country. Sales beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $410 million.\n\nThe FDA’s approval for earlier use of the drug before chemotherapy has approximately tripled the eligible patient population.\n\nCholesterol drug Leqvio sales soared 61% to $298 million on steady growth in demand, with a focus on increasing accounts and patient adoption. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $284 million and our estimate of $282.2 million.\n\nGene-therapy Zolgensma (spinal muscular atrophy) sales of $297 million were down 17% due to a lower incidence of spinal muscular atrophy compared to the prior year, even though demand remained robust.\n\nScemblix sales surged 79% to $238 million, driven by continued growth in chronic myeloid leukemia indication and strong momentum from the recently launched early-line indication in the United States.\n\nLuthathera (cancer) sales totaled $207 million, up 17%. Sales grew mainly in the United States, Europe and Japan due to increased demand and earlier line adoption, particularly in the United States and Japan.\n\nSales of Lucentis plunged 39% to $173 million due to generic competition.\n\nFabhalta generated sales of $120 million, driven by continued launch execution across all markets in PNH and the recent launch in primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in the United States.\n\nRaised 2025 Guidance for Operating Income\n\nNet sales are expected to grow in high single digits (unchanged). Core operating income is now anticipated to grow in the low teens (previous guidance: low double digits).\n\nKey Updates From NVS\n\nThe FDA granted accelerated approval to Vanrafia for the reduction of proteinuria in adults with primary IgAN at risk of rapid disease progression.\n\nRegulatory submissions for OAV101 IT in patients with SMA were completed in the United States and the EU.\n\nNovartis initiated a share buyback plan of $10 billion, expected to be completed by 2027.\n\nNVS CFO Retires\n\nNovartis announced that Harry Kirsch, who has served as its chief financial officer (CFO) since 2013 will retire from the company.\n\nNVS has appointed Mukul Mehta as the new CFO. Harry will continue his role as CFO until March 15, 2026.\n\nOur Take on NVS Q2 Performance\n\nNovartis’ performance was strong, with both earnings and sales beating estimates. Management also raised its guidance for 2025 operating income.\n\nNovartis AG Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nNovartis AG Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nNovartis AG price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Novartis AG Quote\n\nThe company’s performance has been strong in the past few quarters, driven by the solid performance of its key brands.\n\nThe pipeline progress is also encouraging. The label expansion of Pluvicto and Fabhalta should further fuel sales of these drugs. Approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs should enable the company to offset the adverse impacts of generic competition for Tasigna and Promacta.\n\nHowever, the litigation for a generic drug of Entresto is a headwind.\n\nWhile organic growth continues to drive business, NVS is focused on strategic acquisitions to strengthen its pipeline. In June 2025, Novartis acquired Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, for an upfront payment of $0.8 billion. The latter may receive an additional $0.9 billion upon attaining a future regulatory milestone.\n\nThe probable imposition of tariffs in the United States is a headwind as well. NVS had earlier announced a $23 billion investment over five years in U.S.-based infrastructure as it intends to manufacture all key drugs in the country. NVS' decision to expand its current manufacturing, research and technology presence across the country follows President Trump's announcement of tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.\n\nNVS’ Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\n\nNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A couple of other top-ranked large-cap pharmaceutical stocks are Bayer BAYRY and Johnson & Johnson JNJ, both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nBAYRY’s 2025 EPS estimate has increased from $1.19 to $1.30 for 2025 over the past 90 days, while that for 2026 has gone up from $1.28 to $1.35 over the same timeframe. Year to date, shares of Bayer have surged 65.2%.\n\nBAYRY’s earnings beat estimates in one of the trailing four quarters, matched twice and missed on the remaining occasion, the average negative surprise being 13.91%.\n\nJ&J’s EPS estimate for 2025 has risen from $10.60 to $10.66 over the past 60 days, while that for 2026 has increased from $10.98 to $11.13 over the same timeframe.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

By partnering with major pharmaceutical companies, Recursion Pharmaceuticals not only expands its pipeline but also secures substantial non-dilutive funding to support its R&D activities.\n\nThrough its collaboration with Bayer, Recursion Pharmaceuticals is advancing treatments for fibrosis, with potential milestone payments totaling up to $1.5 billion and tiered royalties, reinforcing its revenue potential. Its agreement with Roche focuses on neuroscience and oncology, giving Roche the option to launch up to 40 programs, each of which could yield more than $300 million in milestones for RXRX, along with royalties. Partnerships with Sanofi and Merck further diversify Recursion Pharmaceuticals’ pipeline across oncology, immunology, and neuroinflammation, together offering billions in milestone opportunities and consistent royalty streams.\n\nIn addition to these pharma collaborations, Recursion Pharmaceuticals is investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Its alliance with NVIDIA led to the 2024 upgrade of its supercomputer to BioHive-2. The acquisition of Exscientia in late 2024 added over 20 programs to Recursion Pharmaceuticals’ portfolio and increased its milestone opportunity to more than $20 billion, strengthening its financial foundation.\n\nFurther collaborations with technology leaders like Google Cloud, Helix, and Faro Health enhance RXRX’s AI capabilities, accelerating drug discovery and development. These strategic partnerships not only provide immediate financial support but also amplify Recursion Pharmaceuticals’ ability to scale its platform, pursue innovative therapies, and forge new alliances, positioning the company for sustained, long-term success in the evolving biotech landscape.\n\nRXRX Faces Competitive Pressure in the TechBio Industry\n\nIn the TechBio space, Relay Therapeutics RLAY and Schrödinger SDGR are emerging as strong competitors to Recursion Pharmaceuticals, who also leverage AI-driven platforms to enter into strategic collaboration agreements and develop novel therapies.

The regulatory body approved finerenone for the treatment of adult patients with heart failure (HF) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥40%.\n\nWith the latest FDA approval, Kerendia has become the only non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist approved in the United States for chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes and for HF with LVEF of ≥40%.\n\nLast month, the FDA also expanded Nubeqa’s label for a third indication for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Following this approval, Nubeqa is the first FDA-approved androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, in combination with androgen deprivation therapy, with or without chemotherapy.\n\nIn addition, Nubeqa is approved for the treatment of adult patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease.\n\nWe remind investors that Nubeqa achieved blockbuster status in 2024, with annual sales reaching €1.52 billion for full-year 2024.\n\nBAYRY expects to launch two new drugs — elinzanetant, a hormone-free treatment for menopause symptoms, and acoramidis, a drug for the treatment of a certain type of heart disease.\n\nElinzanetant was recently approved in the UK for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS or hot flashes) associated with menopause under the brand name Lynkuet.

If RFK Jr. accepts Connecticut's request, the drugmakers would be compensated based on a benchmark closer to production costs, not to market rates, according to Robin Feldman, a professor of law and director of the Center for Innovation at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nHHS did not reply to a request for comment from Yahoo Finance. Novo Nordisk declined to comment for this article.\n\n\"The governor and Sec. Kennedy have known each other for a very long time. So I don't know what conversations they may or may not have had. But, I think we're also having some early conversations,\" Lesser said of the state's social services commission.\n\nState Sen. Matt Lesser, who introduced the bill, told Yahoo Finance that other states, both red and blue, have already expressed interest. He said the state has 30 days to submit the petition.\n\n\"The commissioner may enter into a consortium with officials in other states in contracting with such manufacturer for such drugs,\" according to the state's new law.\n\nThe new law calls for the Commissioner of Social Services to petition the US Health and Human Services Department (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to exercise the federal government's right to own the patents of GLP-1s and contract with generic manufacturers to produce a version of the drugs in exchange for royalties that Connecticut says it will pay.\n\nSome states have chosen to restrict or limit who can be prescribed the drugs, while others have stopped covering them altogether. Connecticut expanded coverage in 2023.\n\nThe bill, signed by Gov. Ned Lamont on July 8, focuses on efforts to control drug prices but has a section dedicated to generic GLP-1 drugs, similar to Novo Nordisk's ( NVO ) Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly's ( LLY ) Mounjaro and Zepbound. Combined, the four drugs have been ballooning the state's spending — contributing costs of $140 million in fiscal year 2024 — a problem plaguing many states.\n\nConnecticut passed a new law last week in an effort to lower its spending on weight-loss drugs for its state insurance program — HUSKY Health, which includes Medicaid and CHIP enrollees — and it could help other states do the same if it succeeds.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"While well-intentioned, this provision may present an overreach of Section 1498, which was intended to provide a remedy for patent holders for when the federal government uses patented inventions for its own purposes,\" he said. \"The administration will work collaboratively with the industry, healthcare professionals, and advocates to ensure that provision is implemented as appropriate under federal law.\"\n\nThe strategy faces some uncertainty, but it could be coming at just the right time, according to some experts.\n\nSweet spot\n\nConnecticut's effort comes as prices have begun to ease in the wake of increased supply from drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Both are offering vials at cheaper prices than injectables in direct-to-consumer avenues to counter the massive compounding market.\n\nFormer Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jørgensen previously told Yahoo Finance that the compounding market is \"approximately as big as our own business.\"\n\nCompounders were initially allowed to provide the copycats without FDA approval when the drugs were in short supply. The FDA has since ended the shortages, but some compounders continue to produce the cheaper copycats, claiming they have protections for \"personalized medicine.\" That debate is making its way through the court system and is currently in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nLesser said Connecticut considered compounding but wasn't comfortable with the lack of FDA approval for the products.\n\nIn addition to lower prices, Novo Nordisk's drugs are facing the end of their exclusivity period, which is regulated by the FDA. This is separate from the patents protected by the US Patent Office. While the patents expire in 2031, the FDA exclusivity has already partially expired for semaglutide in recent years\n\nOn top of all that, generic competition is already on the horizon in Canada, which means a manufacturer is currently setting up production and getting approval from a comparable regulatory body to the FDA, according to Rachel Sachs, a professor of innovation policy and patent law at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nThat could also be useful if states decide to import from Canada — and would be quicker than the FDA process to contract with a US-based facility.\n\n\"So this is a sort of sweet spot for those products, where it would be a particularly impactful time for the (patent) law to be used,\" Sachs said.\n\nWill he help Connecticut get into the generic GLP-1s business?

Santiago via Getty Images\n\nBattles for lower prices\n\nThe law Connecticut wants HHS to invoke has been used in the past.\n\nIn 2017, Louisiana invoked the same law to try to get Hepatitis C drugs at a lower cost. At the time, more than 35,000 Medicaid enrollees using the drugs were costing the state $764 million. The drugmaker, Gilead Sciences (GILD), ultimately struck a deal with Louisiana to implement an \"innovative payment model,\" which capped the state's costs.\n\nAnd post-9/11, when there was an anthrax scare, the US government invoked the law to stockpile Bayer's (BAYRY) drug Cipro. Bayer ultimately agreed to lower its price.\n\nRecently, North Carolina tried a different strategy by leveraging its relationships with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which had manufacturing operations in the state last year. It was unsuccessful and had to cut coverage for state employees while keeping coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries. The state petitioned HHS and then-Secretary Xavier Becerra to negotiate lower prices on its behalf but stopped short of invoking the patent law, though some advocacy groups suggested it at the time.\n\nIt's why experts and advocates are closely watching how RFK Jr. responds to this petition.\n\nBut so far, the Trump administration has made no progress in its efforts to curb costs, according to Amy Kapczynski, a professor at Yale Law School and expert on intellectual property rights.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has been weak in addressing drug pricing as a problem, undermining some of the gains of the recent Biden bill to lower drug prices for Medicare,\" she told Yahoo Finance. \"They may not want to do this, and argue that they can’t — but really, I see it as a question of political will.\"\n\nUCSF's Feldman echoed a similar sentiment, adding that the situation could end well for the drugmakers too.\n\n\"There should be a deal to be made that provides very handsome returns for the companies who have brought (these drugs) to society, but in a way that's sustainable and doesn't break the bank,\" she said.\n\nBut others, like Polk Wagner, a law professor and deputy dean at the University of Pennsylvania, say it is unclear if the government would be willing to deploy this strategy.\n\n\"This is most likely a negotiation tactic. As a general matter, the federal government is, rightly, very reluctant to actually use this tool. It's a real undermining of the patent system,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIn addition, its unclear how much money would be saved through this route, he said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Eli Lilly reflected the patent concerns.\n\n“Lilly is closely following the developments in Connecticut and other measures that could endanger the integrity of the U.S. patent system. Intellectual property protections are essential to incentivizing the costly investment and risk required to develop new medicines,\" the company said.\n\n—\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, provider services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

NVS now concentrates on four core therapeutic areas — cardiovascular-renal-metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology.\n\nNVS’ second-quarter sales are likely to have been boosted by strong growth in Entresto, Kisqali, Kesimpta, Leqvio and Scemblix.\n\nCardiovascular drug Entresto sales witnessed a solid year-over-year surge in the first quarter of 2025, driven by robust demand-led growth. Increased penetration in China and Japan for hypertension indication also boosted demand.

The uptrend was triggered after it announced acquiring Rallybio’s RLYB full interest in their joint venture for developing REV102 and an associated backup molecule for the treatment of hypophosphatasia (HPP), a rare and debilitating genetic disorder.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals and Rallybio launched their joint venture in 2019 to explore the use of AI-driven drug discovery for rare diseases. Using its proprietary AI platform, Recursion OS, Recursion Pharmaceuticals pinpointed ENPP1 as a therapeutic target for treating HPP, which ultimately led to the discovery of REV102 — an orally bioavailable, selective ENPP1 inhibitor designed for chronic use, offering high potency and a favorable safety profile.\n\nThe acquisition of full rights to the HPP program marks a strategic move for Recursion Pharmaceuticals, enabling the company to independently accelerate development of what could become the first oral, disease-modifying therapy for HPP. With full control, the company can now more effectively deploy its Recursion OS platform to deepen insights and streamline R&D efforts to bring the treatment to the market as soon as possible.\n\nYear to date, RXRX shares have plunged 20.7% compared with the industry’s 2.9% decline.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPer the terms of the agreement with Rallybio, Recursion Pharmaceuticals will provide $7.5 million in upfront equity, with an additional $12.5 million in contingent equity payable upon the start of further preclinical studies. RXRX will also make a $5 million milestone payment to RLYB upon the initiation of dosing in an upcoming early-stage clinical study. Rallybio is entitled to receive low single-digit royalties on any future net sales generated by Recursion Pharmaceuticals from the program. Additionally, Rallybio may receive further payments if RXRX pursues a sale of the REV102 program.\n\nThe sudden influx of funds in the form of the upfront payment from Recursion Pharmaceuticals strengthened Rallybio’s balance sheet.

The company’s acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. The Zacks analyst expects net revenue to rise 13% year over year in 2025. The accelerated adoption of digital and contactless solutions is providing an opportunity for its businesses to expedite their continued shift to digital.\n\n\n\nStrong cash flow supports its growth initiatives and enables shareholder value-boosting efforts through repurchases and dividends. MA paid a dividend worth $694 million in 1Q25. Its times-interest-earned of 24.2X is above the industry average.\n\n\n\nHowever, MA's dividend yield is lower than the industry average. We expect adjusted operating expenses to grow 14.8% year over year in 2025. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+54.8% vs. +53.8%). The company’s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. An increase in its recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. The Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base as well.\n\n\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco’s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco’s security portfolio.\n\n\n\nHowever, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable service providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco’s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\n\nTJX’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+13.6% vs. +6.5%). The company has been benefiting from its focus on delivering an exceptional shopping experience and unmatched value to customers every day. A key indicator of its business strength is the consistent increase in customer transactions, which drove a solid comparable store sales increase of 3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\n\n\nThis steady growth highlights the company’s successful strategy and positions it for long-term sustainability, focusing on customer transactions. The TJX Companies has been strategically positioned to capitalize on the exceptional availability in the marketplace, offering a diverse selection of exciting gifts both in-store and online.\n\n\n\nHowever, the increase in store wages and payroll costs has raised concerns.

This microcap company with a market capitalization of $221.48 million has a strong $72.2 million backlog in fiscal 2024 and continued order inflow underscore resilient demand visibility, aided by infrastructure funding tailwinds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).\n\n\n\nWith 7.7% revenue growth in fiscal 2024, no debt, and $115.4 million in cash and marketable securities, Gencor is well-positioned to invest or return capital. Its diversified revenue mix across equipment, parts and services supports earnings stability and reduces cyclicality, while ongoing cost discipline supports long-term margin potential.\n\n\n\nHowever, margin compression from rising SG&A and competitive pressure, increased reliance on non-operating income, a build-up in contract assets, and material control weaknesses pose risks.

Strategic divestiture of European operations and a new $23 million credit facility bolster U.S.-focused execution and liquidity.\n\n\n\nYet recurring losses, a 9.7% effective interest rate and weak cash flow limit reinvestment capacity.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Bayer is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Bayer imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

The enrolled patient population was randomized to one of three treatment groups — Cosentyx 300 mg, Cosentyx 150 mg or a placebo, each administered alongside a glucocorticoid (steroid) tapering regimen. Tapering means reducing the steroid exposure to patients over a period of time.\n\nDespite the disappointing results, Cosentyx demonstrated numerically favorable outcomes over placebo in terms of cumulative steroid exposure and steroid-related toxicity.

Because biotech is not just about government finance,” Oelrich said during a press conference last week.\n\nLaunched in 1971, the Nasdaq (originally the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) was the world’s first electronic stock market.\n\nKnown for its fully electronic trading model, the exchange has historically been attractive to fast-growing sectors, including life science, listing some of the world’s largest tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Google.\n\nOelrich argued that Europe must urgently develop a similar equity-driven financing ecosystem.\n\n“Today, there is very limited venture capital available, which is largely due to the way we manage equities. We invest our equities not in venture, but elsewhere,” he said.\n\nAccording to him, the lack of early-stage capital means European biotech innovations often migrate elsewhere — especially to the US, where funding and commercialisation opportunities are more robust.\n\n“The transition from basic research to patented applications tends to follow where the capital is. We must ensure that innovation generated in European universities and research institutions stays in Europe,” he warned.\n\n'Why don’t we do it?'\n\nStefan Oelrich, president of Bayer’s pharmaceutical division and newly appointed head of the EU’s pharmaceutical lobby EFPIA. AP Photo\n\nHis remarks came just ahead of the unveiling of the EU’s long-awaited Life Sciences Strategy, which aims to revive Europe's position as a hub for biotech research and development.\n\nThe strategy acknowledges that the gap in venture capital investment is widening in Europe. It points to the continent’s fragmented capital markets and heavy reliance on bank loans, which are often limited in volume and duration, as major structural issues.\n\nThe strategy also recommends strengthening innovation hubs and integrating them into value chains to better attract private investment.\n\nHowever, it does not place significant emphasis on completing the EU’s Capital Markets Union (CMU), a key demand from Oelrich.\n\n“This may sound ambitious, but it’s absolutely doable. Interestingly, everyone I talk to recognises the need: So why aren’t we acting on it?” Oelrich asked.\n\nHe also suggested that part of Europe's pension and life insurance capital could be redirected toward venture investment if appropriate political frameworks were put in place.\n\n“Inventions can find a market here as it’s not only about a lack of capital in Europe: It’s about how we allocate it. We need to do a better job,” he concluded.\n\nThe broader context\n\nSome of the world’s largest tech companies are listed on the Nasdaq. AP Photo\n\nThe EU’s Capital Markets Union remains incomplete, with progress hindered by regulatory divergence, inconsistent enforcement, and political resistance to deeper integration.\n\nWhile the CMU does not directly aim to create new stock exchanges, it does support efforts to expand access to capital, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nThis improved access could encourage the development of specialised or regional exchanges, though the broader goal remains integration rather than fragmentation.\n\nCurrently, Europe lacks sector-specific stock exchanges. Major platforms like Euronext, the London Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq Nordic, and SIX Swiss Exchange list companies across a wide range of industries.\n\nInstead of dedicated exchanges, sector-focused investment is facilitated through indices such as the STOXX Europe 600 family, which tracks sectors like banking, automotive, and leisure.\n\nStill, for many in the biotech sector, the absence of a specialised capital-raising platform remains a barrier. Whether the EU will — and can — move to address this remains to be seen.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:05:25.360258+00:00"}

This designation is granted when early clinical evidence suggests the drug may significantly improve over existing treatments on one or more important clinical measures. Drugs with this designation receive more intensive guidance and organizational support from senior FDA managers.\n\nYear to date, shares of Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals have lost 13.2% compared with the industry’s 3.4% decline.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe FDA’s decision is supported by early clinical data, including results from a phase I/II study involving 74 AS patients aged 4 to 17 with a complete maternal UBE3A gene deletion. The study showed that participants experienced consistent developmental progress with rapid, sustained and ongoing improvements across multiple symptom areas during up to three years of treatment.\n\nAS is a rare neurogenetic disorder that affects around 60,000 people in accessible markets and leads to severe developmental challenges, including cognitive and motor impairments, speech loss, balance issues, seizures, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, taking a severe toll on the quality of life. Current treatment options for AS are limited, with no approved therapies.\n\nUltragenyx Pharmaceuticals is currently enrolling patients in the phase III Aspire study, evaluating AS patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of full maternal UBE3A gene deletion. The company also plans to initiate a phase II/III clinical study named Aurora to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GTX-102 for treating other AS genotypes in other patient age groups. This additional study aims to enable treatment for a broader range of AS patients and is expected to be initiated in the second half of 2025.\n\nOther Key Clinical Programs in RARE’s Pipeline\n\nUltragenyx Pharmaceuticals has several other interesting gene therapy candidates in its pipeline.

The drug is also approved in the United States for the same indications as in the EU, under the brand name Vascepa.\n\nThe agreement with Recordati builds on Vazkepa’s early success in the EU, where it enjoys patent protection up to 2039, and focuses on expanding the product’s reach to patients at risk of CV, thereby boosting sales. Additionally, it will also enable Amarin to cut operational costs, thereby enhancing its financial strength.\n\nFinancial Considerations for AMRN’s Licensing Deal With Recordati\n\nThe deal grants Recordati an exclusive license to market Amarin’s Vazkepa across Europe. In return, AMRN will receive an upfront payment of $25 million, along with potential milestone payments of up to $150 million, contingent on Recordati meeting certain predefined annual net sales targets.

Pharma companies are continually striving to ramp up innovation and allocate a significant portion of their revenues to R&D. Several drugmakers are embracing AI technology to accelerate the drug discovery process for delivering more effective therapies. Successful innovation and product line extensions in key therapeutic areas, along with strong clinical study results, may serve as important catalysts for these stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi-million-dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas, like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health products, medical devices and consumer-related healthcare products. They invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already-marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies, and these large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions, and collaboration deals are other key features of large drugmakers.\n\nThe sky-high tariffs imposed by the United States and retaliatory tariffs by China and some other countries hurt global stock markets in April. With the massive tariffs imposed by the United States and China currently on a pause, the markets recovered slightly. However, this is only a temporary suspension. The uncertainty around tariffs and trade production measures remains, which has muted economic growth. However, amid the broader macro uncertainty, the drug and biotech sector seems to have recovered in the past month, backed by positive pipeline and regulatory developments. Innovation is at its peak with key spaces like rare diseases, next-generation oncology treatments, obesity, immunology and neuroscience attracting investor attention. M&A activity also remains healthy. Regular pipeline setbacks, slow ramp-up of newer drugs, patent cliffs, regulatory risks and broader market concerns related to the economy are some of the headwinds for the sector. Nonetheless, large drugmakers have several robust revenue streams and are mostly profitable companies, making them safe havens for investments. Among the large drugmakers, AbbVie ABBV, Novartis NVS, Pfizer PFE, Sanofi SNY and Bayer BAYRY are worth retaining in one’s portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nAggressive M&A & Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&A activities. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies, sitting on substantial cash reserves, regularly acquire innovative small and mid-cap biotech companies to expand their pipelines.\n\nAlso, sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices and the growing use of AI for drug discovery whet the M&A appetite of large drugmakers. Moreover, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing. Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&A activities. Recently, areas such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease have been attracting buyout interest.\n\nAn important M&A deal announced recently was Sanofi’s offer to acquire Blueprint Medicines for approximately $9.5 billion. M&A activity is expected to remain rampant through the rest of the year.\n\nPipeline Setbacks & Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments, a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs, Medicare drug price negotiations and increasing FTC scrutiny of M&A deals.\n\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty: Uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including the risk of inflation, fluctuating interest rates and instability in the financial system, along with escalating geopolitical tensions in various parts of the world, have increased broader economic woes. Uncertainties around tariffs also remain a headwind.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bright Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is an 11-stock group within the broader Medical sector. The group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #36, which places it in the top 15% of 245 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBefore we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let’s take a look at the industry’s performance and its current valuation.\n\nIndustry Versus S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe industry has outpaced the Zacks Medical Sector as well as the S&P 500 year to date.\n\nStocks in this industry have collectively risen 3.9% so far this year against the Zacks Medical Sector’s decline of 1.5%. The Zacks S&P 500 composite has risen 1.7%.\n\nYTD Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 15.65X compared with the S&P 500’s 21.89X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 19.31X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 20.80X, as low as 12.92X and at a median of 15.65X, as the chart below shows.\n\nForward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\n5 Large Drugmakers to Watch\n\nBayer: The company’s key drugs, Nubeqa for cancer and Kerendia for chronic kidney disease associated with type II diabetes, are fueling growth in its Pharmaceuticals division. Bayer is also working to expand the labels of Nubeqa and Kerendia, which, if successful, can further drive growth.\n\nThe company also plans to launch two new drugs in 2025, which are elinzanetant, a hormone-free treatment for menopause symptoms, and ceramides, a drug for the treatment of a certain form of heart disease. The Consumer Health segment also improved in 2024 due to the launch of new products, which should keep the momentum in 2025. However, sales in the Crop Science division declined significantly in the past couple of years due to lower volumes and prices for glyphosate-based products.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have risen 61.9% so far this year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nEstimates for its 2025 earnings per share have increased from $1.19 to $1.25 over the past 60 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: BAYRY\n\nPfizer: It is one of the largest and most successful drugmakers in the field of oncology. The company’s position in oncology was strengthened with the addition of Seagen in 2023. Though COVID revenues are declining, its non-COVID operational revenues are improving, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel, Padcev and Eliquis, new launches and newly acquired products like Nurtec and those from Seagen.\n\nPfizer faces its share of challenges, the key being declining sales of its COVID-19 products. It also expects a significant impact from the loss of patent exclusivity in the 2026-2030 period, as several of its key products may face patent expirations. The Medicare Part D redesign under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is also expected to negatively impact sales of Pfizer’s higher-priced drugs, such as Vyndaqel, Ibrance, Xtandi and Xeljanz,in 2025.\n\nHowever, as COVID-related uncertainties dwindle, its revenue volatility is also declining. The company’s non-COVID drugs and contribution from new and newly acquired products should continue to drive top-line growth in 2025. Also, Pfizer expects cost cuts and internal restructuring to deliver savings of at least $6.0 billion. Continued growth in non-COVID sales and significant cost-reduction measures should drive profit growth.\n\nPfizer has a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has risen from $2.98to $3.06 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has lost 4.2% year to date.\n\nPrice and Consensus: PFE\n\nNovartis: With the separation of Sandoz, Novartis has become a pure-play pharmaceutical company. Novartis maintains strong momentum on the back of a strong and diverse portfolio with drugs like Kisqali, Kesimpta, Pluvicto and Leqvio. The uptake of Pluvicto and Scemblix has been outstanding and should propel top-line growth. Approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs should enable Novartis to offset the adverse impacts of the generic competition of key drugs. Novartis is also looking to solidify its presence in the promising gene therapy space. The recent spate of acquisitions and collaborations has strengthened its pipeline. However, generic erosion of some drugs and recent pipeline setbacks are a concern.\n\nNovartis has a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Swiss drugmaker’s 2025 EPS has risen from $8.46 to $8.74 over the past 60 days. The stock has risen 25.6% so far this year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: NVS\n\nAbbVie: It has successfully navigated the loss of exclusivity (LOE) of its blockbuster drug, Humira, by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications and should support top-line growth in the next few years.\n\nAbbVie expects to return to robust revenue growth in 2025, which is just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE, driven by its ex-Humira platform.\n\nBoosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through 2029, as it has no significant LOE event for the rest of this decade. Strong sales performance of drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Venclexta and Vraylar, coupled with significant contributions from newer drugs like Ubrelvy, Elahere, Epkinly and Qulipta, should keep driving the company’s top line.\n\nAbbVie has several early/mid-stage pipeline candidates with blockbuster potential. The company expects several regulatory submissions, approvals and key data readouts in the next 12 months. The company has been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years, which is strengthening its pipeline.\n\nAbbVie has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. The stock has risen 9.5% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has remained stable at $12.28 per share over the past 60 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: ABBV\n\nSanofi: Dupixent has become the key top-line driver for Sanofi as it enjoys strong demand across all approved indications and geographies. New uses, increased penetration in approved indications and further geographic expansion are expected to drive Dupixent’s sales in future quarters.\n\nSanofi possesses a leading vaccine portfolio, which drives the top line. Several new drugs were launched in the past couple of years that have become significant contributors to Sanofi's accelerated top-line growth profile. Sanofi increased R&D investments and achieved significant progress with its pipeline in 2024. It has also been active on the M&A front. However, generic erosion of Aubagio in all key markets and lower sales from mature products are hurting sales. Other headwinds include the weak sales of influenza vaccines and regular negative pipeline developments.\n\nSanofi has a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The stock has risen 6.3% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has risen from $4.43 to $4.56 over the past 60 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: SNY\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Detailed data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting Monday showed treatment reduced vasomotor symptoms in women receiving endocrine therapy to treat or prevent hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\n\nVasomotor symptoms include hot flashes and disrupted sleep, and are typically associated with menopause. However, these symptoms can occur in almost 90% of women with early breast cancer who are treated with endocrine drugs. The side effects are disruptive enough to sometimes cause breast cancer patients to stop treatment, which could affect disease progression and, ultimately, survival.\n\nIn women experiencing menopause, hormone-replacement therapies can be used to treat vasomotor symptoms. But in women with early-stage breast cancer, those same treatments can increase the risk of their disease worsening or returning.\n\n“With no currently approved treatments for this indication, there is an unmet medical need for therapeutic options,” said Fatima Cardoso, the study’s lead investigator and the director of the breast cancer unit at the Champalimaud Cancer Center in Lisbon, Portugal, in a statement provided by Bayer.\n\nElinzanent provides a non-hormonal option. The drug targets two receptors, NK1 and NK3, that help regulate body temperature. In Oasis-4, 316 participants were randomly assigned to take elinzanetant once daily, while 157 received placebo. Vasomotor symptoms were assessed at one and three months. After 12 weeks, people who had been given placebo were switched to elinzanetant for the remainder of the main one-year evaluation period.\n\nResults showed that elinzanetant quickly alleviated symptoms at both weeks 4 and 12 compared to placebo, meeting the study’s primary goal. After one month, 61% of women taking the Bayer drug reported the frequency of daily moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms had been reduced by at least half. And at three months, women taking the drug experienced greater improvements in sleep and quality of life compared to those on placebo.\n\nTrial participants who switched to elinzanetant after taking a placebo for 12 weeks also experienced similar benefits.\n\n“It's due time that new innovation comes into this space,” said Yesmean Wahdan, vice president of U.S. medical affairs for Bayer’s women’s health unit, in an interview with BioPharma Dive. “[This therapy] really aims at targeting the source of what's causing the symptoms that are happening as the woman goes through the menopausal transition and into menopause.”\n\nThe Oasis-4 results were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine Monday.\n\nLast year, Bayer unveiled data from a Phase 3 study of women taking elinzanetant for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. The drug proved efficacious among this group of women as well, supporting an application by Bayer for approval.\n\n“[Menopause] is a condition many women will enter into and face no matter where you are in life,” Wahdan said. “Some enter it via clinical reasons. They're put on medications, they have surgery. And some of us enter it as a transition in life.”\n\nIf approved in women with vasomotor symptoms as a result of their breast cancer treatment, elinzanetant would be the first therapeutic of its kind.\n\n“It's a therapy that is targeted at all women who are experiencing these [vasomotor] symptoms,” Wahdan said. “We know that [women taking endocrine therapy] have, for a long time, been excluded from some of the more traditional therapies for symptoms of menopause.”\n\nOne approved non-hormonal option for vasomotor symptoms comes from Japanese pharmaceutical company Astellas Pharma, but it is not approved for women being treated for breast cancer. Called Veozah, the drug has struggled commercially due to weaker-than-expected demand and reimbursement issues. The Food and Drug Administration also recently added a safety warning for possible liver damage to the drug’s labeling.\n\nIn Oasis-4, almost 70% of women taking elinzanetant reported at least one adverse event, versus 62% of those in the placebo group. There were serious adverse events reported in eight women treated with Bayer’s drug. Most commonly, however, side effects were fatigue, headache and drowsiness.\n\nIn an editorial published in NEJM, Ann Partridge, interim chair of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s medical oncology department, noted that a better understanding of elinzanetant’s side effects will be essential to incorporating the drug in patient care.\n\n“Reassuringly, the present trial and previous trials of elinzanetant have shown no increased risk of toxic effects on the liver, which have been reported in rare cases with another agent in this class,” she wrote, referring to Veozah.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:05:51.584626+00:00"}

Similar to Eylea, Vabysmo is approved for a range of retinal diseases but has higher uptake due to the longer intervals between injections.\n\nGlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate? Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. By GlobalData Learn more about Strategic Intelligence\n\nVabysmo generated $4.3bn in sales in 2024, becoming one of Roche’s top-selling drugs. Whilst Eylea and Eylea 8mg – the latter known as Eylea HD in the US – reached combined sales of $9.5bn in 2024, year-over-year growth was lower than Vabysmo. Regeneron and Bayer are also having to contend with a market influx of biosimilars.\n\nTherefore, an extended treatment interval could be a major step for Bayer in maintaining its market share. The positive judgment by the committee was based on positive three-year results from open-label extension studies of the pivotal clinical trials PULSAR (NCT04423718) and PHOTON (NCT04429503) in nAMD and DME, respectively. Eylea 8mg demonstrated that it could maintain visual and anatomic improvements at dosing intervals of six months. Across both studies, 24% of patients in nAMD and 28% of patients in DME had a last assigned dosing gap of six months at the end of the three years.\n\nThe long-term data did not show any new safety signals, and the rates of ocular treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were similar across patients switching from 2mg to 8mg of Eylea.\n\nEylea works by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which prevents abnormal blood vessel growth. With the label extension, Eylea 8mg would be the only anti-VEGF approved for a treatment interval of six months. Roche’s Vabysmo became the first bispecific antibody approved for the eye. It acts by neutralising angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and VEGF-A.\n\nBayer’s global product strategy and commercialisation executive vice-president Christine Roth said: “Following approval of the European Commission, extended treatment intervals with Eylea 8mg of up to six months can significantly reduce the frequency of injections and visits to the clinic for patients.\n\n“These extended intervals, combined with the unique product profile of Eylea 8mg, position it to become a new standard of care for retinal diseases.”\n\nSign up for our daily news round-up!

Teliso-V, which will be marketed by the name of Emrelis, is the first-in-class therapy approved for the above-mentioned NSCLC patient group that often faces a poor prognosis and has limited treatment options. The approval was based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response data from the phase II LUMINOSITY study.\n\nFDA Approves MRK's Welireg for Rare Adrenal Tumors\n\nMerck announced that the FDA has granted approval to Welireg for the treatment of patients with advanced pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Currently, there are no approved therapies for treating these rare adrenal tumors. The FDA approval was based on ORR data from the phase II LITESPARK-015 study. This approval marks the third indication for Welireg in the United States. Welireg is currently approved in the United States for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma andsome von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors.\n\nMerck's phase III ovarian cancer study on a Keytruda regimen met its primary endpoint by showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival. The KEYNOTE-B96 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel) with or without bevacizumab in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer whose tumors expressed PD-L1 and in all comers. The study also met its secondary endpoint of overall survival for patients whose tumors express PD-L1. Keytruda is not presently approved to treat any indication in ovarian cancer.\n\nGSK Buys Rights to Phase III-Ready Liver Disease Candidate\n\nGSK announced that it is buying rights to clinical-stage biotech Boston Pharmaceuticals' lead pipeline candidate, efimosfermin alfa, to treat and prevent the progression of steatotic liver disease (SLD). In phase II studies, efimosfermin alfa has shown the potential to reverse liver fibrosis and stop its progression in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (\"MASH\"), a form of SLD.\n\nSLD affects approximately 5% of the global population and represents an area of significant unmet medical need with limited treatment options. Efimosfermin, with its direct antifibrotic mechanism of action, has the potential to establish a new standard of care for treating MASH.\n\nFor the deal, GSK will make an upfront payment of $1.2 billion to Boston Pharmaceuticals, with the latter also being entitled to potential milestone payments of $800 million.\n\nTrump's Most Favored Nations Policy\n\nThis week, the Trump administration issued an executive order that will push drugmakers to offer prescription drugs to U.S. cash-pay consumers at lower prices. The executive order will see U.S. consumers paying the same amount as the nation that pays the lowest price for that drug. He termed this policy the \"most favored nation policy.\" The President feels that the cost of prescription drugs in the United States is higher than in any other country, sometimes even five to ten times higher. Trump believes the order will result in a 30% to 80% decrease in prescription drug prices in the United States.\n\nThe order mentioned that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will create programs to let Americans buy drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies at the most-favored-nation, lowest price.

Also, how did The Hedge facility perform in FY25, and what is the guidance for FY26? A : The Hedge facility generated revenue of INR 40 crores in FY25, with a negative EBITDA of INR 14 crores. For FY26, revenue is expected to increase to INR 60 crores, with EBITDA remaining similar. Regarding the monsoon, both IMD and SkyMet have given a positive forecast, which is encouraging for planting.

A: B2B sales accounted for about 9% of total revenue, including technical sales of INR 40 crores, while 91% came from brand sales. Last year, B2B sales were about 4%. We are introducing a new fungicide product, expecting INR 10 crores in revenue, but it won't significantly impact EBITDA this year.\n\nQ: What is the total addressable market for the two fungicide molecules acquired from Bayer, and what revenue are you expecting from them in FY26 and FY27? A: The total addressable market for these molecules is approximately USD 100 million. We expect to generate INR 110 crores in revenue from these products in FY26, including both Indian and international sales. One product is focused on the Brazilian market, while the other is spread across more than 20 countries.\n\nQ: How do you plan to utilize the cash position, especially after the acquisition of the two products from Bayer? A: We maintain a healthy practice of rewarding shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We recently announced a 100% dividend. We will continue to explore strategic opportunities for cash utilization and will share updates as they arise.\n\nQ: How is the international market performing, and is it aligning with your expectations following the acquisition of the two fungicides? A: The international market presents a significant opportunity for us. The acquisition of these fungicides provides a gateway to expand our footprint in export markets, including Brazil, the world's largest agrochemical market. We are optimistic about the potential for these products to enhance our international presence.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:06:06.556382+00:00"}

A: Rodrigo Santos, Head of Crop Science, explained that excluding regulatory impacts, the core business would have grown by 2.4%. The corn business is expected to grow by 2.5% in Q1 due to accounting adjustments. Crop protection reported 2% growth, which would be 5% excluding regulatory impacts. The company remains confident in its guidance for the year, driven by innovation and core business health.\n\nQ: Can you provide an update on the glyphosate litigation and potential outcomes if the Supreme Court does not accept the case? A: William Anderson, CEO, stated that Bayer expects to hear from the Supreme Court in June or October. The company is not relying solely on this plan and is working with Congress for potential legislative solutions. Bayer is also considering structural options and remains open to settlements, provided they offer a high degree of finality.\n\nQ: How confident are you in the safety and efficacy of Asendexian, and what is the expected market potential? A: Stefan Oelrich, Head of Pharmaceuticals, expressed confidence in Asendexian's safety and efficacy, noting positive results from the Pacific program. The Phase III study targets populations with significant effects observed in Phase II. The market potential is substantial, especially if prevalent cases are included.\n\nQ: Could you elaborate on the state legislation efforts related to glyphosate and their significance? A: William Anderson highlighted that state legislation is crucial for providing certainty to manufacturers and signaling to Congress the need for federal clarification. Missouri is a key state due to the volume of lawsuits filed there. Bayer is pursuing legislation in additional states to support its position.\n\nQ: What are Bayer's expectations for corn acreage in the U.S., and how does it impact profitability compared to soy? A: Rodrigo Santos stated that Bayer is optimistic about high corn acreage in the U.S., potentially reaching 94-95 million acres. Corn is more profitable than soy, and Bayer expects growth in corn globally. The company is also focused on margin expansion through cost control and efficiency improvements.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:06:12.827927+00:00"}

The Insecticides business decreased 12.3% due to lower Movento sales in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region following the expiration of its registration in the EU. Sales at Cotton Seed were down 19.9% due to regulatory impacts in the United States.

While the stock has lost 6.4% over the past week, it could witness a trend reversal as a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session. This could mean that the bulls have been able to counteract the bears to help the stock find support.\n\nThe formation of a hammer pattern is considered a technical indication of nearing a bottom with likely subsiding of selling pressure. But this is not the only factor that makes a bullish case for the stock. On the fundamental side, strong agreement among Wall Street analysts in raising earnings estimates for this company enhances its prospects of a trend reversal.\n\n1-month candlestick chart for BAYRY\n\nWhat is a Hammer Chart and How to Trade It?\n\nThis is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'\n\nIn simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.\n\nWhen it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.\n\nHammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.\n\nLike every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.\n\nHere's What Increases the Odds of a Turnaround for BAYRY\n\nAn upward trend in earnings estimate revisions that BAYRY has been witnessing lately can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 4.7% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering BAYRY are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:06:40.748778+00:00"}

However, several lawsuits have been filed by people for the same, alleging that Monsanto’s herbicide caused them to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or related cancers.\n\nIt has also been alleged by plaintiffs that the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew, or should have known, of the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn its users.\n\nThe ongoing glyphosate litigation in the United States has adversely impacted Bayer’s cash position due to high legal costs.\n\nNonetheless, the company plans to appeal the latest verdict by the Georgia court and stated that it has secured favorable outcomes in 17 of the last 25 trials.\n\nBayer had earlier argued that leading health regulators worldwide have repeatedly concluded that its glyphosate products can be used safely and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.\n\nAccording to the company, in July 2024, a judge in the Federal Court of Australia (with the aid of a neutral, court-appointed scientific expert and following a scientific conclave process) found in a detailed 322-page opinion that the weight of scientific evidence does not support a link between glyphosate and NHL.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2024, Bayer’s provision for the glyphosate litigation totaled $5.9 billion.\n\nThe company also plans to file a petition for review with the U.S. Supreme Court in the ongoing glyphosate litigation.\n\nBAYRY’s Efforts to Combat Challenges\n\nBayer plans to pay out only the legally required minimum dividend in 2025, while also looking to reduce its debt. 2024 was a tough year for the company due to strong headwinds in the Crop Science business. The uncertainty caused by ongoing Roundup litigation is also a major hangover on the stock. BAYRY had earlier slashed its dividends to conserve cash, as increasing Roundup litigation charges had adversely impacted the bottom line.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:06:42.580056+00:00"}

In the Large-Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, AbbVie (ABBV), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Novartis (NVS), Pfizer (PFE) and Bayer (BAYRY) are worth retaining in one's portfolio", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-large-drug-stocks-watch-104700001.html", "published_at": "2025-03-25T10:47:00Z", "source": "Zacks", "text": "Innovation and Pipeline Success: For big drugmakers, an innovative pipeline is a competitive necessity and key to top-line growth. Pharma companies are continually striving to ramp up innovation and allocate a significant portion of their revenues to R&D. Several drugmakers are embracing AI technology to accelerate the drug discovery process for deliveringmore effective therapies. Successful innovation and product line extensions in key therapeutic areas, along with strong clinical study results, may serve as important catalysts for these stocks.\n\nContinuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies, and these large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions and collaboration deals are other key features of large drugmakers\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticalsindustry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi-million-dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas, like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health products, medical devices and consumer-related healthcare products.They invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already-marketed drugs.\n\nThe drug and biotech sector has recovered over the past couple of months, following a slow start to the year, primarily due to the better-than-expected fourth-quarter performance of large drugmakers and an overall optimistic outlook for the year. Innovation is at its peak for the industry, with key spaces like rare diseases, next-generation oncology treatments, obesity, immunology and neuroscience attracting investor attention. R&D innovation is likely to remain a major focus area in 2025 . M&A activity is also expected to remain strong, particularly with Trump’s return to the White House. Regular pipeline setbacks, slow ramp-up of newer drugs, patent cliffs, regulatory risks and broader market concerns related to the economy are some of the headwinds for the sector. There remains uncertainty about how Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new Health Secretary, will treat the drug and biotech sector as he is known to be a vaccine skeptic. Nonetheless, large drugmakers have several robust revenue streams and are mostly profitable companies, which make them safe havens for investments. Among the large drugmakers, AbbVie ABBV, Novo Nordisk NVO, Novartis NVS, Pfizer PFE and Bayer BAYRY are worth retaining in one’s portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAggressive M&A & Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&A activities. Given that it takes several years and millions ofdollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies, sitting on substantial cash reserves, regularly acquire innovative small and mid-cap biotech companies to expand their pipelines.\n\nAlso, sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices and the growing use of AI for drug discovery whet the M&A appetite of large drugmakers.Moreover, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing.Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&A activities. Recently, areas such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease have been attracting buyout interest.\n\nAn important M&A deal announced this year was J&J’s offer to buy Intra-Cellular Therapies for approximately $14.6 billion. M&A activity is expected to remain rampant in 2025.\n\nPipeline Setbacks & Other Headwinds: Thefailure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments, a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs, Medicare drug price negotiations and increasing FTC scrutiny of M&A deals.\n\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty: Escalating geopolitical tensions in various parts of the world, like the Russia-Ukraine war and increasing tensions between the United States and China and their impact on global economic growth and macroeconomic uncertainty, have increased economic woes.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bright Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industryis a 12-stock group within the broader Medicalsector. The group’s Zacks Industry Rankis basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #67, which places it in the top 27% of 247 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBefore we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let’s take a look at the industry’s performance and its current valuation.\n\nIndustry Versus S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe industry has outpaced the Zacks Medical Sector as well as the S&P 500 year to date.\n\nStocks in this industry have collectively risen 6.3% so far this year compared with the Zacks Medical Sector’s growth of 4.3%. In contrast, the Zacks S&P 500 composite has declined 4.1%.\n\nYTD Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 16.69X compared with the S&P 500’s 20.77X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 20.56X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 20.80X, as low as 12.92X and at a median of 15.13X, as the chart below shows.\n\nForward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\n5 Large Drugmakers to Watch\n\nNovo Nordisk: The company has a strong presence in the Diabetes care market, with one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. NVO’s success in the past few years is underscored by its semaglutide (GLP-1 agonist) medicines, which are marketed as Ozempic and Rybelsus for type II diabetes and Wegovy for obesity and are seeing great demand trends and driving the top line. Label expansions of its semaglutide medicines in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales.\n\nNovo Nordisk has been addressing the supply constraints of Wegovy by making investments to increase production. Moreover, the FDA removed Wegovy from the shortage list in late February, which means the agency is confident that the company can meet its current and future demand.\n\nNovo Nordisk is making good progress with its pipeline, which includes several other new candidates for type-II diabetes and obesity as well as candidates for treating haemophilia.\n\nNVO has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has risen from $3.84 to $3.93 over the past 30 days. The stock has lost 12.5% so far this year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: NVO\n\nBayer: The company’s key drugs, Nubeqa for cancer and Kerendia for chronic kidney disease associated with type II diabetes, are fueling growth in its Pharmaceuticals division. It is also working to expand the labels of Nubeqa and Kerendia, which, if successful, can further drive growth.\n\nBayer also plans to launch two new drugs in 2025, which are elinzanetant, a hormone-free treatment for menopause symptoms, and ceramides, a drug for the treatment of a certain form of heart disease. The Consumer Health segment also improved in 2024 due to the launch of new products. However, sales in the Crop Science division declined significantly in the past couple of years due to lower volumes and prices for glyphosate-based products.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 company’s shares have risen 23.9% so far this year. Estimates for its 2025 earnings per share have increased from $1.14 to $1.20 over the past 30 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: BAYRY\n\nPfizer: It is one of the largest and most successful drugmakers in the field of oncology. The company’s position in oncology was strengthened with the addition of Seagen in December 2023. After possibly experiencing its worst slowdown in 2023/2024, Pfizer appears to be gradually making a comeback and entering a transition phase. Though COVID revenues are declining, its non-COVID operational revenues improved in 2024, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel, Padcev and Eliquis, new launches and newly acquired products like Nurtec and those from Seagen.\n\nPfizer faces its share of challenges, the key being declining sales of its COVID-19 products. It also expects a significant impact from the loss of patent exclusivity in the 2026-2030 period, as several of its key products may face patent expirations. The Medicare Part D redesign under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is also expected to negatively impact sales of Pfizer’s higher-priced drugs, such as Vyndaqel, Ibrance, and Xeljanz, in 2025.\n\nHowever, as COVID-related uncertainties dwindle, its revenue volatility is also declining. The company’s non-COVID drugs and contribution from new and newly acquired products should continue to drive top-line growth in 2025. Also, Pfizer expects cost cuts and internal restructuring to deliver savings of at least $6.0 billion. Continued growth in non-COVID sales and significant cost-reduction measures should drive profit growth.\n\nPfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has risen from $2.95to $2.97 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has lost 1.7% year to date.\n\nPrice and Consensus: PFE\n\nAbbVie: Sales of AbbVie’s blockbuster drug, Humira, are declining due to loss of exclusivity and biosimilar erosion. However, the company has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity (LOE) by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications. This should support top-line growth in the next few years.\n\nStrong sales performance of drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Venclexta and Vraylar, coupled with significant contributions from newer drugs like Ubrelvy, Elahere, Epkinly and Qulipta, should keep driving the company’s top line in 2025.\n\nHowever, AbbVie is witnessing declining sales of Juvederm fillers in the United States and China due to challenging market conditions, which might be a headwind in 2025. AbbVie also faces other headwinds, such as Humira biosimilar erosion, increasing competitive pressure on cancer drug Imbruvica and regular pipeline setbacks.\n\nNonetheless, boosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through 2029, as it has no significant LOE event for the rest of this decade. A substantial portion of this growth is expected to be driven by the robust performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\n\nAbbVie has several early/mid-stage pipeline candidates with blockbuster potential. The company anticipates several regulatory submissions, approvals, and key data readouts within the next 12 months. It has been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years, which is strengthening its pipeline.\n\nAbbVie has a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nThe stock has risen 17.7% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has risen from $12.28 to $12.30 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: ABBV\n\nNovartis: With the separation of Sandoz, Novartis has become a pure-play pharmaceutical company. Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio. Its new oncology drugs, such as Pluvicto, Scemblix, and Kisqali , put up a stellar performance in 2024. Other drugs, such as Cosentyx, Entresto, and Kesimpta, as well as newer drugs like Leqvio and Fabhlata, are expected to contribute significantly to the top line in the coming years. Backed by strong momentum across all key drugs, the solid top-line performance is expected to continue in 2025.\n\nNovartis is also looking to solidify its presence in the promising gene therapy space. The recent spate of acquisitions and collaborations has strengthened its pipeline.\n\nNovartis has a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Swiss drugmaker’s 2025 EPS has risen from $8.45 to $8.47 over the past 60 days. The stock has risen 14.1% so far this year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: NVS\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
