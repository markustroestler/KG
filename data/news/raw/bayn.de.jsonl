Credit: Liverpool FC via Getty Images.\n\nWhen attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz arrived at Liverpool Football Club from Bayer Leverkusen to the sound of jubilant supporters this summer, few anticipated that the transfer would cause concern at big pharma Bayer.\n\nBayer – a German drugmaker that owns compatriot football club Bayer Leverkusen – reported better-than-expected Q2 results last week. Operating income came in at €2.1bn ($2.43bn) for the company, fuelled apparently by strong growth in its pharmaceutical portfolio.\n\nHowever, a more detailed Q2 earnings report released on 6 August revealed that the results included revenue from players sold at Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nIn its Q2 report, Bayer wrote: “In the reconciliation, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation (EBITDA) before special items increased against the prior-year period, largely thanks to higher revenue from player transfers at Bayer 04 Leverkusen Fußball GmbH.”\n\nA Bayer spokesperson declined to add further information after Pharmaceutical Technology’s request, saying only the player transfers “helped improve this figure”.\n\nDespite a positive Q2 report that also included Bayer raising its 2025 sales outlook, investors were downbeat after the disclosure. Shares in the company closed 8% down at €24.98 on 6 August compared to the market open.\n\nGlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?

By GlobalData Learn more about Strategic Intelligence\n\nThere was also a lukewarm reception to in-depth analysis of its pharma segment, which showed that the 0.6% growth came more from a slower decline in sales of off-patent anticoagulant Xarelto (rivaroxaban). Investors usually hope that growth in newer products, with longer patent protection, will further fuel revenue.\n\n“The detail of the beat being somewhat related to Xarelto and the sale of a footballer could be disappointing to some,” JP Morgan analysts wrote in a note sent to Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nLeverkusen have permanently sold a total of six players in the summer transfer window for fees, according to Transfermarkt. The highest by far was Wirtz’s transfer to Liverpool FC for a British-record fee of €136.3m in June. The deal structure includes €117.5m upfront for the player, meaning Leverkusen receive that immediately. Other deals include Jeremie Frimpong – also to Liverpool FC – for €40m in May and Odilon Kossounon transferred for €20m in June.\n\nGerman football league rules dictate that fan members maintain majority ownership and control of their clubs. Bayer’s ownership of Leverkusen goes back to 1904, when the club was established, predating voting rights rules. It is unclear how much of Leverkusen’s profits funnel back to Bayer.\n\nJP Morgan analysts specifically highlighted the Wirtz transfer driving lower reconciliation costs, which came in at an EBITDA of €13m, €106m better than consensus.\n\nDespite the noise around player transfers inflating earnings, there were distinct growth points for Bayer’s newly launched drugs. Prostate cancer therapy Nubeqa (darolutamide) grew 50.5% to €546m, while Kerendia (finerenone) stretched sales by 67.1% to €183m.\n\nSeparately, Bayer announced it has now cut 12,000 full-time positions since the start of its restructuring programme designed to save €2bn by 2026.\n\nSign up for our daily news round-up!

Panellists Prasun Mishra, founding director of Agility Pharmaceuticals, and Naymisha Patel, senior vice-president of Tenaya Therapeutics, will explore how the sector is navigating issues related to regulations, sustainability, and AI.\n\nIn addition to companies such as Alynlam Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, and Denali Therapeutics, representatives from US Customs and Border Protection will also be participating throughout the conference.\n\nThe first day’s sessions will be split into two streams focused on clinical supply logistics and operations, and clinical supply technology and innovation. Kicking off the former will be a talk on data analytics and flexibility for risk management and forecasting by Rachael Pierce, senior clinical trial supply manager at Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals.\n\nForecasting and risk management are at the forefront of discussions in the sector amidst Trump’s newly imposed tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. First proposed by the President in April, a 15% rate was agreed upon for imports from the European Union (EU) late last month while talks with other regions continue to take place. On 5 August, Trump further said tariff rates on drug imports from the EU could go as high as 250%.\n\nGlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?

The morning will also see a keynote session on regulatory guidelines and quality assurance by Patel, and another on ensuring supply chains incorporate patient experience by patient advocate Christine von Raesfeld.\n\nClosing the day is a roundup of the wider biopharma industry trends and emerging technologies, and opportunities in 2025, which will be given by Amanda Murphy, senior director of data intelligence and solutions at GlobalData. Considering the rising growth in initiatives related to environmental, social and governance (ESG), the conference will end with an interactive discussion on environmental sustainability in clinical trial supply chains.\n\nThe conference is hosted by Arena International Events Group, a B2B events company owned by GlobalData, the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.

These candidates were being developed for cerebral cavernous malformation, neurofibromatosis type II and Clostridioides difficile infection, respectively.\n\nRXRX shares have lost 16% year to date against the industry’s 0.5% growth.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFollowing the terminations, Recursion Pharmaceuticals shifted focus to more promising candidates, notably REC-4881, which is being evaluated in a phase Ib/II TUPELO study for familial adenomatous polyposis. In May 2025, the company reported preliminary data from this study, with additional data expected in the second half of 2025.\n\nIn 2024, Recursion Pharmaceuticals initiated its phase I/II DAHLIA study of REC-1245, a new chemical entity for the treatment of biomarker-enriched solid tumors and lymphoma. Data readout from the phase I portion of the DAHLIA study is expected in the first half of 2026. Recursion Pharmaceuticals is also developing a few other candidates, like REC-617 (advanced solid tumors) and REC-3565 (B-cell malignancies), in separate early-stage studies.\n\nIn July 2025, Recursion Pharmaceuticals acquired Rallybio’s full stake in their joint venture for developing REV102 and an associated backup molecule for the treatment of hypophosphatasia. REV102, a potent and selective ENPP1 inhibitor with strong preclinical safety data, is expected to enter phase I studies by late 2026.

The drug is SRPT’s one-shot gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”).\n\nSarepta stated that the voluntary pause is a proactive measure to allow sufficient time to address any information requests and to complete the Elevidys safety labeling supplement process with the FDA. SRPT expressed its commitment to a collaborative, science-based review and ongoing dialogue with the agency.\n\nThis marks yet another major setback for Sarepta, with serious implications for its revenue-generating potential. The company relies heavily on Elevidys to drive top-line growth, with the therapy contributing over half of total revenues in the first quarter of 2025. The voluntary pause in U.S. shipments is expected to significantly impact Sarepta’s financial performance in the second half of the year.\n\nSRPT Halts US Elevidys Shipments Amid Mounting Setbacks\n\nThe decision to temporarily halt U.S. shipments of Elevidys comes on the heels of the death of a patient dosed with one of its experimental gene therapies. Last week, Sarepta confirmed that a 51-year-old, non-ambulant (unable to walk) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (“LGMD”) patient died due to acute liver failure (“ALF”). The unfortunate event occurred in a phase I study of the investigational gene therapy candidate, SRP-9004, which is being developed for LGMD Type 2D.\n\nThis marked the third patient death confirmed by Sarepta from the use of its gene therapies. Earlier this year, SRPT reported two cases of patient death following treatment with Elevidys for DMD. Like the latest death, the two earlier deaths were also due to ALF and occurred in non-ambulatory patients.\n\nBased on these incidents, the FDA placed all Sarepta’s clinical studies for LGMD on hold.

The unfortunate event occurred in a phase I study of the investigational gene therapy candidate, SRP-9004, which is being developed for LGMD Type 2D.\n\nThis marks the third patient death confirmed by Sarepta from the use of its gene therapies. Earlier this year, SRPT reported two cases of patient death following treatment with Elevidys, its one-shot gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Like the latest setback, these two deaths were also due to ALF and occurred in non-ambulatory patients.\n\nBased on these events, Sarepta has suspended Elevidys dosing for non-ambulatory patients in the commercial setting and is considering an enhanced immunosuppression regimen to make the therapy safer for these patients. It has also voluntarily paused dosing in the ongoing late-stage ENVISION study designed to satisfy the regulatory requirements for Elevidys outside the United States. This study is evaluating the therapy in non-ambulatory and ambulatory DMD patients. However, the therapy has been mandated by the FDA to carry a black box warning for ALF and acute liver injury.\n\nSarepta is heavily dependent on Elevidys for revenue generation. During the first quarter of 2025, sales from the therapy accounted for over half of its top line. The safety concerns are bound to severely impact sales of the drug in the second half of the year, which will cause the company’s top line to suffer.

Eylea sales have boosted the company’s top line for many years. However, Eylea’s sales have been under pressure in the past couple of years due to competition from Roche’s RHHBY Vabysmo.\n\nThe uptake of Roche’s Vabysmo has been phenomenal. Roche has designed Vabysmo to block pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A.\n\nBiosimilar competition for Eylea is also worrisome. Since Eylea accounts for a majority of REGN’s sales, a rapid decline in sales has adversely impacted the company’s top line.\n\nTo counter the decline in Eylea sales, Regeneron has developed a higher dose of the drug. While the initial uptake of Eylea HD was encouraging as Eylea patients transitioned to the higher dose, it will take Eylea HD quite some time to offset the rapid erosion in Eylea sales.\n\nIn April 2025, the FDA accepted for priority review a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval of Eylea HD for both the treatment of macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and broadening the dosing schedule to include every 4-week (monthly) dosing across approved indications. The FDA has set a target action date of Aug. 19, 2025.\n\nHowever, the regulatory body issued a complete response letter (“CRL”) for the pre-filled syringe of Eylea HD. Per the company, the key outstanding issue relates to a question posed by the FDA to a third-party component supplier. This component supplier has expeditiously responded to FDA requests for information.\n\nThe FDA also issued a CRL regarding the sBLA for the addition of extended dosing intervals. The FDA indicated that the submitted data did not support extended dosing intervals greater than every 16 weeks.\n\nRegeneron has a collaboration agreement with Bayer BAYRY for Eylea. Regeneron records the net product sales of Eylea and Eylea HD in the United States, and Bayer records its net product sales outside the country.

Traditional biotech companies rely on a “trial-and-error” approach, leading to significant cash burn during early research and development. The high failure rates and funding challenges often result in financial instability or bankruptcy, hindering progress in the sector.\n\nHowever, Recursion Pharmaceuticals’ solid fundamentals and the promising potential of Recursion OS make us believe that the stock could deliver multi-bagger returns in the future. Let’s dig deeper and understand the company’s strengths and weaknesses in greater detail to understand how to play the stock going forward.\n\nYear to date, RXRX stock has plunged 20.3% compared with the industry’s 1.9% decline. The company has also underperformed the sector and the S&P 500 during the same time frame, as seen in the chart below.\n\nThe promising pipeline update comes on the heels of a major setback in May 2025 that had significantly shaken investor confidence in the company. Recursion Pharmaceuticals discontinued the development of three key drug candidates — REC-994, REC-2282 and REC-3964 — due to disappointing results from mid-stage studies. REC-994 and REC-2282 were being developed for cerebral cavernous malformation and neurofibromatosis type II, respectively, but showed insufficient efficacy to justify further investment. Similarly, REC-3964, for Clostridioides difficile infection, was also shelved as the company opted to focus on areas with greater unmet needs. The move was part of a broader strategic pipeline reprioritization.\n\nBy securing full ownership, Recursion Pharmaceuticals can now independently advance the program, aiming to deliver the first oral, disease-modifying treatment for HPP. Under the deal, RXRX will pay Rallybio $7.5 million upfront in equity, $12.5 million in contingent equity tied to preclinical progress, and another $5 million upon initiating dosing in an early-stage clinical study. Rallybio will also earn low single-digit royalties on future sales and may receive additional payments if the program is sold.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals RXRX shares have gained 5.5% in a month. The stock gained momentum after the company announced the acquisition of Rallybio’s full stake in their joint venture earlier this month for developing REV102 and a backup candidate for hypophosphatasia (HPP), a rare genetic disorder. The partnership, launched in 2019, leveraged Recursion Pharmaceuticals’ AI-powered Recursion OS (developed with NVIDIA) to identify ENPP1 as a therapeutic target, leading to the creation of REV102, a promising oral ENPP1 inhibitor with high potency and safety for chronic use.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn contrast, Recursion Pharmaceuticals leverages AI-powered models to test clinical compounds against a virtual library of human biology, hoping to identify promising candidates with higher probabilities of success in clinical development. This approach could reduce research costs, improve efficiency, and allow the company to deliver breakthrough therapies at lower prices. Additionally, it can generate incremental revenues by licensing its AI platform to other drug makers, as demonstrated by its collaborations with Merck, Bayer BAYRY, Sanofi SNY and Roche RHHBY. Even when candidates fail in clinical studies, Recursion Pharmaceuticals could use the resulting data to refine and enhance its AI models, improving accuracy and long-term outcomes.\n\nRXRX’s Retained Pipeline Demonstrates Potential\n\nAs part of its strategic pipeline reprioritization efforts, Recursion Pharmaceuticals has shifted its focus and resources to the development of other candidates in its clinical pipeline. Such candidates include REC-4881, which is being developed for familial adenomatous polyposis in a phase Ib/II TUPELO study. A data readout from the study is expected in the second half of 2025.\n\nBeyond REC-4881, Recursion Pharmaceuticalsis advancing other candidates to diversify and strengthen its pipeline. These include REC-1245, currently in a phase I/II DAHLIA study for biomarker-enriched solid tumors and lymphoma, with initial results anticipated in the first half of 2026. The company is also exploring REC-617 for advanced solid tumors and REC-3565 for B-cell malignancies in separate early-stage studies. The company ended first-quarter 2025 with a cash balance of $509 million, which is expected to fuel operations into mid-2027 based on its current business plan.\n\nAdditionally, Recursion Pharmaceuticalshas ongoing collaboration agreements with pharma giants like Roche, Bayer, Merck and Sanofi to develop candidates for several oncology indications with differentiated mechanisms of action. RXRX recently received $7 million in collaboration revenues from Sanofi, following the achievement of a significant discovery milestone.\n\nCompetitive Pressure and Pipeline Risks Cloud RXRX’s Outlook\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals faces intense competition from biotech firms, tech-driven drug discovery companies, and pharmaceutical giants, all leveraging computational tools and scalable platforms. Rivalry from companies like Relay Therapeutics, Isomorphic Labs, and even tech giants like Alphabet and Microsoft could challenge RXRX’s ability to differentiate itself and sustain its competitive edge.\n\nInvestors are also apprehensive of the company’s pipeline potential as its investigational candidates are still in the early stages of development and far from commercialization. There are chances that it will not have a product in the market for at least three to four years.\n\nRXRX’s Discount Valuation & Mixed Estimate Movements\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals is trading at a discount to the industry, as seen in the chart below.

Sales grew strongly across all regions, driven by exemplary growth in the United States with strong momentum from the recently launched early breast cancer (eBC) indication as well as continued share gains in the metastatic breast cancer indication.\n\nCosentyx’s sales (psoriasis, spondylitis and arthritis) increased 6% to $1.6 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.7 billion and our model estimate of $1.8 billion. The year-over-year improvement was driven by recent launches, including the hidradenitis suppurativa indication (HS) and the intravenous formulation (IV) in the United States and Europe, and volume growth in core indications.\n\nEntresto’s sales comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34 billion and our model estimate of $2.23 billion.\n\nHowever, Novartis is in litigation with a generic manufacturer and the FDA to protect its Entresto IP and regulatory rights in the United States.\n\nCardiovascular drug Entresto’s sales rose 22% from the year-ago level to $2.36 billion. The growth was driven by the heart failure indication in the United States and Europe, and both heart failure and hypertension indications in China and Japan.\n\nWith the successful spin-off of the Sandoz business in 2023, Novartis now focuses on four core therapeutic areas — cardiovascular-renal-metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology.\n\nAll growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.\n\nShares of Novartis have gained 24.5% year to date against the industry’s decline of 0.4%.\n\nHowever, shares are down in pre-market trading, most likely due to the Cosentyx sales miss and the CFO retirement news.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, sales increased 11%, driven by continued strong performance from Kisqali, Entresto, Kesimpta, Scemblix, Leqvio and Pluvicto.\n\nRevenues of $14.05 billion climbed 12% from the year-ago reported figure and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.04 billion.\n\nCore earnings (excluding one-time charges) of $2.42 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38 and were up from $1.97 reported a year ago. The year-over-year improvement was driven by strong growth in sales. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar .)\n\nSwiss pharma giant Novartis AG NVS reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter of 2025 and upped annual guidance for core operating income.\n\nStory Continues\n\nKisqali sales beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1.1 billion.\n\nKesimpta (multiple sclerosis) sales totaled $1.1 billion, which rose 33% on increased demand and strong access. The figure beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1 billion.\n\nStrong performances by Tafinlar + Mekinist (up 7% to $573 million) and Jakavi (up 8% to $524 million) also boosted the top line.\n\nHowever, Promacta sales were down 9% to $502 million due to discontinued promotion in most markets and recent generic entry in the United States in May 2025.\n\nXolair (asthma and allergies) sales grew 2% to $443 million. Sales grew slightly, driven by the chronic spontaneous urticaria indication. Novartis has a collaboration agreement with Roche RHHBY for Xolair. Novartis and Roche co-promote Xolair in the United States.\n\nIlaris sales amounted to $477 million, which increased 27% year over year, driven by growth in all regions led by the United States and Europe. Strong performance in the Periodic Fever Syndromes and Still’s disease indications also contributed to this growth.\n\nTasigna sales plunged 27% to $327 million due to lower demand and increasing competition, including the recent generic entry in the United States in May 2025.\n\nPluvicto (prostate cancer) raked in sales of $454 million, up 30% on encouraging demand uptake in the United States following the pre-taxane metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) approval, as well as expansion in the post-taxane mCRPC setting outside the country. Sales beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $410 million.\n\nThe FDA’s approval for earlier use of the drug before chemotherapy has approximately tripled the eligible patient population.\n\nCholesterol drug Leqvio sales soared 61% to $298 million on steady growth in demand, with a focus on increasing accounts and patient adoption. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $284 million and our estimate of $282.2 million.\n\nGene-therapy Zolgensma (spinal muscular atrophy) sales of $297 million were down 17% due to a lower incidence of spinal muscular atrophy compared to the prior year, even though demand remained robust.\n\nScemblix sales surged 79% to $238 million, driven by continued growth in chronic myeloid leukemia indication and strong momentum from the recently launched early-line indication in the United States.\n\nLuthathera (cancer) sales totaled $207 million, up 17%. Sales grew mainly in the United States, Europe and Japan due to increased demand and earlier line adoption, particularly in the United States and Japan.\n\nSales of Lucentis plunged 39% to $173 million due to generic competition.\n\nFabhalta generated sales of $120 million, driven by continued launch execution across all markets in PNH and the recent launch in primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in the United States.\n\nRaised 2025 Guidance for Operating Income\n\nNet sales are expected to grow in high single digits (unchanged). Core operating income is now anticipated to grow in the low teens (previous guidance: low double digits).\n\nKey Updates From NVS\n\nThe FDA granted accelerated approval to Vanrafia for the reduction of proteinuria in adults with primary IgAN at risk of rapid disease progression.\n\nRegulatory submissions for OAV101 IT in patients with SMA were completed in the United States and the EU.\n\nNovartis initiated a share buyback plan of $10 billion, expected to be completed by 2027.\n\nNVS CFO Retires\n\nNovartis announced that Harry Kirsch, who has served as its chief financial officer (CFO) since 2013 will retire from the company.\n\nNVS has appointed Mukul Mehta as the new CFO. Harry will continue his role as CFO until March 15, 2026.\n\nOur Take on NVS Q2 Performance\n\nNovartis’ performance was strong, with both earnings and sales beating estimates. Management also raised its guidance for 2025 operating income.\n\nNovartis AG Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nNovartis AG Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nNovartis AG price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Novartis AG Quote\n\nThe company’s performance has been strong in the past few quarters, driven by the solid performance of its key brands.\n\nThe pipeline progress is also encouraging. The label expansion of Pluvicto and Fabhalta should further fuel sales of these drugs. Approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs should enable the company to offset the adverse impacts of generic competition for Tasigna and Promacta.\n\nHowever, the litigation for a generic drug of Entresto is a headwind.\n\nWhile organic growth continues to drive business, NVS is focused on strategic acquisitions to strengthen its pipeline. In June 2025, Novartis acquired Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, for an upfront payment of $0.8 billion. The latter may receive an additional $0.9 billion upon attaining a future regulatory milestone.\n\nThe probable imposition of tariffs in the United States is a headwind as well. NVS had earlier announced a $23 billion investment over five years in U.S.-based infrastructure as it intends to manufacture all key drugs in the country. NVS' decision to expand its current manufacturing, research and technology presence across the country follows President Trump's announcement of tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.\n\nNVS’ Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\n\nNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A couple of other top-ranked large-cap pharmaceutical stocks are Bayer BAYRY and Johnson & Johnson JNJ, both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nBAYRY’s 2025 EPS estimate has increased from $1.19 to $1.30 for 2025 over the past 90 days, while that for 2026 has gone up from $1.28 to $1.35 over the same timeframe. Year to date, shares of Bayer have surged 65.2%.\n\nBAYRY’s earnings beat estimates in one of the trailing four quarters, matched twice and missed on the remaining occasion, the average negative surprise being 13.91%.\n\nJ&J’s EPS estimate for 2025 has risen from $10.60 to $10.66 over the past 60 days, while that for 2026 has increased from $10.98 to $11.13 over the same timeframe.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

By partnering with major pharmaceutical companies, Recursion Pharmaceuticals not only expands its pipeline but also secures substantial non-dilutive funding to support its R&D activities.\n\nThrough its collaboration with Bayer, Recursion Pharmaceuticals is advancing treatments for fibrosis, with potential milestone payments totaling up to $1.5 billion and tiered royalties, reinforcing its revenue potential. Its agreement with Roche focuses on neuroscience and oncology, giving Roche the option to launch up to 40 programs, each of which could yield more than $300 million in milestones for RXRX, along with royalties. Partnerships with Sanofi and Merck further diversify Recursion Pharmaceuticals’ pipeline across oncology, immunology, and neuroinflammation, together offering billions in milestone opportunities and consistent royalty streams.\n\nIn addition to these pharma collaborations, Recursion Pharmaceuticals is investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Its alliance with NVIDIA led to the 2024 upgrade of its supercomputer to BioHive-2. The acquisition of Exscientia in late 2024 added over 20 programs to Recursion Pharmaceuticals’ portfolio and increased its milestone opportunity to more than $20 billion, strengthening its financial foundation.\n\nFurther collaborations with technology leaders like Google Cloud, Helix, and Faro Health enhance RXRX’s AI capabilities, accelerating drug discovery and development. These strategic partnerships not only provide immediate financial support but also amplify Recursion Pharmaceuticals’ ability to scale its platform, pursue innovative therapies, and forge new alliances, positioning the company for sustained, long-term success in the evolving biotech landscape.\n\nRXRX Faces Competitive Pressure in the TechBio Industry\n\nIn the TechBio space, Relay Therapeutics RLAY and Schrödinger SDGR are emerging as strong competitors to Recursion Pharmaceuticals, who also leverage AI-driven platforms to enter into strategic collaboration agreements and develop novel therapies.

The regulatory body approved finerenone for the treatment of adult patients with heart failure (HF) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥40%.\n\nWith the latest FDA approval, Kerendia has become the only non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist approved in the United States for chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes and for HF with LVEF of ≥40%.\n\nLast month, the FDA also expanded Nubeqa’s label for a third indication for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Following this approval, Nubeqa is the first FDA-approved androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, in combination with androgen deprivation therapy, with or without chemotherapy.\n\nIn addition, Nubeqa is approved for the treatment of adult patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease.\n\nWe remind investors that Nubeqa achieved blockbuster status in 2024, with annual sales reaching €1.52 billion for full-year 2024.\n\nBAYRY expects to launch two new drugs — elinzanetant, a hormone-free treatment for menopause symptoms, and acoramidis, a drug for the treatment of a certain type of heart disease.\n\nElinzanetant was recently approved in the UK for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS or hot flashes) associated with menopause under the brand name Lynkuet.

If RFK Jr. accepts Connecticut's request, the drugmakers would be compensated based on a benchmark closer to production costs, not to market rates, according to Robin Feldman, a professor of law and director of the Center for Innovation at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nHHS did not reply to a request for comment from Yahoo Finance. Novo Nordisk declined to comment for this article.\n\n\"The governor and Sec. Kennedy have known each other for a very long time. So I don't know what conversations they may or may not have had. But, I think we're also having some early conversations,\" Lesser said of the state's social services commission.\n\nState Sen. Matt Lesser, who introduced the bill, told Yahoo Finance that other states, both red and blue, have already expressed interest. He said the state has 30 days to submit the petition.\n\n\"The commissioner may enter into a consortium with officials in other states in contracting with such manufacturer for such drugs,\" according to the state's new law.\n\nThe new law calls for the Commissioner of Social Services to petition the US Health and Human Services Department (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to exercise the federal government's right to own the patents of GLP-1s and contract with generic manufacturers to produce a version of the drugs in exchange for royalties that Connecticut says it will pay.\n\nSome states have chosen to restrict or limit who can be prescribed the drugs, while others have stopped covering them altogether. Connecticut expanded coverage in 2023.\n\nThe bill, signed by Gov. Ned Lamont on July 8, focuses on efforts to control drug prices but has a section dedicated to generic GLP-1 drugs, similar to Novo Nordisk's ( NVO ) Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly's ( LLY ) Mounjaro and Zepbound. Combined, the four drugs have been ballooning the state's spending — contributing costs of $140 million in fiscal year 2024 — a problem plaguing many states.\n\nConnecticut passed a new law last week in an effort to lower its spending on weight-loss drugs for its state insurance program — HUSKY Health, which includes Medicaid and CHIP enrollees — and it could help other states do the same if it succeeds.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"While well-intentioned, this provision may present an overreach of Section 1498, which was intended to provide a remedy for patent holders for when the federal government uses patented inventions for its own purposes,\" he said. \"The administration will work collaboratively with the industry, healthcare professionals, and advocates to ensure that provision is implemented as appropriate under federal law.\"\n\nThe strategy faces some uncertainty, but it could be coming at just the right time, according to some experts.\n\nSweet spot\n\nConnecticut's effort comes as prices have begun to ease in the wake of increased supply from drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Both are offering vials at cheaper prices than injectables in direct-to-consumer avenues to counter the massive compounding market.\n\nFormer Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jørgensen previously told Yahoo Finance that the compounding market is \"approximately as big as our own business.\"\n\nCompounders were initially allowed to provide the copycats without FDA approval when the drugs were in short supply. The FDA has since ended the shortages, but some compounders continue to produce the cheaper copycats, claiming they have protections for \"personalized medicine.\" That debate is making its way through the court system and is currently in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nLesser said Connecticut considered compounding but wasn't comfortable with the lack of FDA approval for the products.\n\nIn addition to lower prices, Novo Nordisk's drugs are facing the end of their exclusivity period, which is regulated by the FDA. This is separate from the patents protected by the US Patent Office. While the patents expire in 2031, the FDA exclusivity has already partially expired for semaglutide in recent years\n\nOn top of all that, generic competition is already on the horizon in Canada, which means a manufacturer is currently setting up production and getting approval from a comparable regulatory body to the FDA, according to Rachel Sachs, a professor of innovation policy and patent law at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nThat could also be useful if states decide to import from Canada — and would be quicker than the FDA process to contract with a US-based facility.\n\n\"So this is a sort of sweet spot for those products, where it would be a particularly impactful time for the (patent) law to be used,\" Sachs said.\n\nWill he help Connecticut get into the generic GLP-1s business?

Santiago via Getty Images\n\nBattles for lower prices\n\nThe law Connecticut wants HHS to invoke has been used in the past.\n\nIn 2017, Louisiana invoked the same law to try to get Hepatitis C drugs at a lower cost. At the time, more than 35,000 Medicaid enrollees using the drugs were costing the state $764 million. The drugmaker, Gilead Sciences (GILD), ultimately struck a deal with Louisiana to implement an \"innovative payment model,\" which capped the state's costs.\n\nAnd post-9/11, when there was an anthrax scare, the US government invoked the law to stockpile Bayer's (BAYRY) drug Cipro. Bayer ultimately agreed to lower its price.\n\nRecently, North Carolina tried a different strategy by leveraging its relationships with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which had manufacturing operations in the state last year. It was unsuccessful and had to cut coverage for state employees while keeping coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries. The state petitioned HHS and then-Secretary Xavier Becerra to negotiate lower prices on its behalf but stopped short of invoking the patent law, though some advocacy groups suggested it at the time.\n\nIt's why experts and advocates are closely watching how RFK Jr. responds to this petition.\n\nBut so far, the Trump administration has made no progress in its efforts to curb costs, according to Amy Kapczynski, a professor at Yale Law School and expert on intellectual property rights.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has been weak in addressing drug pricing as a problem, undermining some of the gains of the recent Biden bill to lower drug prices for Medicare,\" she told Yahoo Finance. \"They may not want to do this, and argue that they can’t — but really, I see it as a question of political will.\"\n\nUCSF's Feldman echoed a similar sentiment, adding that the situation could end well for the drugmakers too.\n\n\"There should be a deal to be made that provides very handsome returns for the companies who have brought (these drugs) to society, but in a way that's sustainable and doesn't break the bank,\" she said.\n\nBut others, like Polk Wagner, a law professor and deputy dean at the University of Pennsylvania, say it is unclear if the government would be willing to deploy this strategy.\n\n\"This is most likely a negotiation tactic. As a general matter, the federal government is, rightly, very reluctant to actually use this tool. It's a real undermining of the patent system,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIn addition, its unclear how much money would be saved through this route, he said.\n\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Eli Lilly reflected the patent concerns.\n\n“Lilly is closely following the developments in Connecticut and other measures that could endanger the integrity of the U.S. patent system. Intellectual property protections are essential to incentivizing the costly investment and risk required to develop new medicines,\" the company said.\n\n—\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, provider services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

NVS now concentrates on four core therapeutic areas — cardiovascular-renal-metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology.\n\nNVS’ second-quarter sales are likely to have been boosted by strong growth in Entresto, Kisqali, Kesimpta, Leqvio and Scemblix.\n\nCardiovascular drug Entresto sales witnessed a solid year-over-year surge in the first quarter of 2025, driven by robust demand-led growth. Increased penetration in China and Japan for hypertension indication also boosted demand.

The uptrend was triggered after it announced acquiring Rallybio’s RLYB full interest in their joint venture for developing REV102 and an associated backup molecule for the treatment of hypophosphatasia (HPP), a rare and debilitating genetic disorder.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals and Rallybio launched their joint venture in 2019 to explore the use of AI-driven drug discovery for rare diseases. Using its proprietary AI platform, Recursion OS, Recursion Pharmaceuticals pinpointed ENPP1 as a therapeutic target for treating HPP, which ultimately led to the discovery of REV102 — an orally bioavailable, selective ENPP1 inhibitor designed for chronic use, offering high potency and a favorable safety profile.\n\nThe acquisition of full rights to the HPP program marks a strategic move for Recursion Pharmaceuticals, enabling the company to independently accelerate development of what could become the first oral, disease-modifying therapy for HPP. With full control, the company can now more effectively deploy its Recursion OS platform to deepen insights and streamline R&D efforts to bring the treatment to the market as soon as possible.\n\nYear to date, RXRX shares have plunged 20.7% compared with the industry’s 2.9% decline.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPer the terms of the agreement with Rallybio, Recursion Pharmaceuticals will provide $7.5 million in upfront equity, with an additional $12.5 million in contingent equity payable upon the start of further preclinical studies. RXRX will also make a $5 million milestone payment to RLYB upon the initiation of dosing in an upcoming early-stage clinical study. Rallybio is entitled to receive low single-digit royalties on any future net sales generated by Recursion Pharmaceuticals from the program. Additionally, Rallybio may receive further payments if RXRX pursues a sale of the REV102 program.\n\nThe sudden influx of funds in the form of the upfront payment from Recursion Pharmaceuticals strengthened Rallybio’s balance sheet.

The company’s acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. The Zacks analyst expects net revenue to rise 13% year over year in 2025. The accelerated adoption of digital and contactless solutions is providing an opportunity for its businesses to expedite their continued shift to digital.\n\n\n\nStrong cash flow supports its growth initiatives and enables shareholder value-boosting efforts through repurchases and dividends. MA paid a dividend worth $694 million in 1Q25. Its times-interest-earned of 24.2X is above the industry average.\n\n\n\nHowever, MA's dividend yield is lower than the industry average. We expect adjusted operating expenses to grow 14.8% year over year in 2025. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+54.8% vs. +53.8%). The company’s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. An increase in its recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. The Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base as well.\n\n\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco’s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco’s security portfolio.\n\n\n\nHowever, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable service providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco’s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\n\nTJX’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+13.6% vs. +6.5%). The company has been benefiting from its focus on delivering an exceptional shopping experience and unmatched value to customers every day. A key indicator of its business strength is the consistent increase in customer transactions, which drove a solid comparable store sales increase of 3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\n\n\nThis steady growth highlights the company’s successful strategy and positions it for long-term sustainability, focusing on customer transactions. The TJX Companies has been strategically positioned to capitalize on the exceptional availability in the marketplace, offering a diverse selection of exciting gifts both in-store and online.\n\n\n\nHowever, the increase in store wages and payroll costs has raised concerns.

This microcap company with a market capitalization of $221.48 million has a strong $72.2 million backlog in fiscal 2024 and continued order inflow underscore resilient demand visibility, aided by infrastructure funding tailwinds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).\n\n\n\nWith 7.7% revenue growth in fiscal 2024, no debt, and $115.4 million in cash and marketable securities, Gencor is well-positioned to invest or return capital. Its diversified revenue mix across equipment, parts and services supports earnings stability and reduces cyclicality, while ongoing cost discipline supports long-term margin potential.\n\n\n\nHowever, margin compression from rising SG&A and competitive pressure, increased reliance on non-operating income, a build-up in contract assets, and material control weaknesses pose risks.

Strategic divestiture of European operations and a new $23 million credit facility bolster U.S.-focused execution and liquidity.\n\n\n\nYet recurring losses, a 9.7% effective interest rate and weak cash flow limit reinvestment capacity.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Bayer is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Bayer imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

The enrolled patient population was randomized to one of three treatment groups — Cosentyx 300 mg, Cosentyx 150 mg or a placebo, each administered alongside a glucocorticoid (steroid) tapering regimen. Tapering means reducing the steroid exposure to patients over a period of time.\n\nDespite the disappointing results, Cosentyx demonstrated numerically favorable outcomes over placebo in terms of cumulative steroid exposure and steroid-related toxicity.

Because biotech is not just about government finance,” Oelrich said during a press conference last week.\n\nLaunched in 1971, the Nasdaq (originally the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) was the world’s first electronic stock market.\n\nKnown for its fully electronic trading model, the exchange has historically been attractive to fast-growing sectors, including life science, listing some of the world’s largest tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Google.\n\nOelrich argued that Europe must urgently develop a similar equity-driven financing ecosystem.\n\n“Today, there is very limited venture capital available, which is largely due to the way we manage equities. We invest our equities not in venture, but elsewhere,” he said.\n\nAccording to him, the lack of early-stage capital means European biotech innovations often migrate elsewhere — especially to the US, where funding and commercialisation opportunities are more robust.\n\n“The transition from basic research to patented applications tends to follow where the capital is. We must ensure that innovation generated in European universities and research institutions stays in Europe,” he warned.\n\n'Why don’t we do it?'\n\nStefan Oelrich, president of Bayer’s pharmaceutical division and newly appointed head of the EU’s pharmaceutical lobby EFPIA. AP Photo\n\nHis remarks came just ahead of the unveiling of the EU’s long-awaited Life Sciences Strategy, which aims to revive Europe's position as a hub for biotech research and development.\n\nThe strategy acknowledges that the gap in venture capital investment is widening in Europe. It points to the continent’s fragmented capital markets and heavy reliance on bank loans, which are often limited in volume and duration, as major structural issues.\n\nThe strategy also recommends strengthening innovation hubs and integrating them into value chains to better attract private investment.\n\nHowever, it does not place significant emphasis on completing the EU’s Capital Markets Union (CMU), a key demand from Oelrich.\n\n“This may sound ambitious, but it’s absolutely doable. Interestingly, everyone I talk to recognises the need: So why aren’t we acting on it?” Oelrich asked.\n\nHe also suggested that part of Europe's pension and life insurance capital could be redirected toward venture investment if appropriate political frameworks were put in place.\n\n“Inventions can find a market here as it’s not only about a lack of capital in Europe: It’s about how we allocate it. We need to do a better job,” he concluded.\n\nThe broader context\n\nSome of the world’s largest tech companies are listed on the Nasdaq. AP Photo\n\nThe EU’s Capital Markets Union remains incomplete, with progress hindered by regulatory divergence, inconsistent enforcement, and political resistance to deeper integration.\n\nWhile the CMU does not directly aim to create new stock exchanges, it does support efforts to expand access to capital, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nThis improved access could encourage the development of specialised or regional exchanges, though the broader goal remains integration rather than fragmentation.\n\nCurrently, Europe lacks sector-specific stock exchanges. Major platforms like Euronext, the London Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq Nordic, and SIX Swiss Exchange list companies across a wide range of industries.\n\nInstead of dedicated exchanges, sector-focused investment is facilitated through indices such as the STOXX Europe 600 family, which tracks sectors like banking, automotive, and leisure.\n\nStill, for many in the biotech sector, the absence of a specialised capital-raising platform remains a barrier. Whether the EU will — and can — move to address this remains to be seen.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:05:25.360258+00:00"}

This designation is granted when early clinical evidence suggests the drug may significantly improve over existing treatments on one or more important clinical measures. Drugs with this designation receive more intensive guidance and organizational support from senior FDA managers.\n\nYear to date, shares of Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals have lost 13.2% compared with the industry’s 3.4% decline.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe FDA’s decision is supported by early clinical data, including results from a phase I/II study involving 74 AS patients aged 4 to 17 with a complete maternal UBE3A gene deletion. The study showed that participants experienced consistent developmental progress with rapid, sustained and ongoing improvements across multiple symptom areas during up to three years of treatment.\n\nAS is a rare neurogenetic disorder that affects around 60,000 people in accessible markets and leads to severe developmental challenges, including cognitive and motor impairments, speech loss, balance issues, seizures, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, taking a severe toll on the quality of life. Current treatment options for AS are limited, with no approved therapies.\n\nUltragenyx Pharmaceuticals is currently enrolling patients in the phase III Aspire study, evaluating AS patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of full maternal UBE3A gene deletion. The company also plans to initiate a phase II/III clinical study named Aurora to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GTX-102 for treating other AS genotypes in other patient age groups. This additional study aims to enable treatment for a broader range of AS patients and is expected to be initiated in the second half of 2025.\n\nOther Key Clinical Programs in RARE’s Pipeline\n\nUltragenyx Pharmaceuticals has several other interesting gene therapy candidates in its pipeline.

The drug is also approved in the United States for the same indications as in the EU, under the brand name Vascepa.\n\nThe agreement with Recordati builds on Vazkepa’s early success in the EU, where it enjoys patent protection up to 2039, and focuses on expanding the product’s reach to patients at risk of CV, thereby boosting sales. Additionally, it will also enable Amarin to cut operational costs, thereby enhancing its financial strength.\n\nFinancial Considerations for AMRN’s Licensing Deal With Recordati\n\nThe deal grants Recordati an exclusive license to market Amarin’s Vazkepa across Europe. In return, AMRN will receive an upfront payment of $25 million, along with potential milestone payments of up to $150 million, contingent on Recordati meeting certain predefined annual net sales targets.

Pharma companies are continually striving to ramp up innovation and allocate a significant portion of their revenues to R&D. Several drugmakers are embracing AI technology to accelerate the drug discovery process for delivering more effective therapies. Successful innovation and product line extensions in key therapeutic areas, along with strong clinical study results, may serve as important catalysts for these stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi-million-dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas, like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health products, medical devices and consumer-related healthcare products. They invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already-marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies, and these large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions, and collaboration deals are other key features of large drugmakers.\n\nThe sky-high tariffs imposed by the United States and retaliatory tariffs by China and some other countries hurt global stock markets in April. With the massive tariffs imposed by the United States and China currently on a pause, the markets recovered slightly. However, this is only a temporary suspension. The uncertainty around tariffs and trade production measures remains, which has muted economic growth. However, amid the broader macro uncertainty, the drug and biotech sector seems to have recovered in the past month, backed by positive pipeline and regulatory developments. Innovation is at its peak with key spaces like rare diseases, next-generation oncology treatments, obesity, immunology and neuroscience attracting investor attention. M&A activity also remains healthy. Regular pipeline setbacks, slow ramp-up of newer drugs, patent cliffs, regulatory risks and broader market concerns related to the economy are some of the headwinds for the sector. Nonetheless, large drugmakers have several robust revenue streams and are mostly profitable companies, making them safe havens for investments. Among the large drugmakers, AbbVie ABBV, Novartis NVS, Pfizer PFE, Sanofi SNY and Bayer BAYRY are worth retaining in one’s portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nAggressive M&A & Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&A activities. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies, sitting on substantial cash reserves, regularly acquire innovative small and mid-cap biotech companies to expand their pipelines.\n\nAlso, sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices and the growing use of AI for drug discovery whet the M&A appetite of large drugmakers. Moreover, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing. Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&A activities. Recently, areas such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease have been attracting buyout interest.\n\nAn important M&A deal announced recently was Sanofi’s offer to acquire Blueprint Medicines for approximately $9.5 billion. M&A activity is expected to remain rampant through the rest of the year.\n\nPipeline Setbacks & Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments, a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs, Medicare drug price negotiations and increasing FTC scrutiny of M&A deals.\n\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty: Uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including the risk of inflation, fluctuating interest rates and instability in the financial system, along with escalating geopolitical tensions in various parts of the world, have increased broader economic woes. Uncertainties around tariffs also remain a headwind.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bright Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is an 11-stock group within the broader Medical sector. The group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #36, which places it in the top 15% of 245 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBefore we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let’s take a look at the industry’s performance and its current valuation.\n\nIndustry Versus S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe industry has outpaced the Zacks Medical Sector as well as the S&P 500 year to date.\n\nStocks in this industry have collectively risen 3.9% so far this year against the Zacks Medical Sector’s decline of 1.5%. The Zacks S&P 500 composite has risen 1.7%.\n\nYTD Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 15.65X compared with the S&P 500’s 21.89X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 19.31X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 20.80X, as low as 12.92X and at a median of 15.65X, as the chart below shows.\n\nForward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\n5 Large Drugmakers to Watch\n\nBayer: The company’s key drugs, Nubeqa for cancer and Kerendia for chronic kidney disease associated with type II diabetes, are fueling growth in its Pharmaceuticals division. Bayer is also working to expand the labels of Nubeqa and Kerendia, which, if successful, can further drive growth.\n\nThe company also plans to launch two new drugs in 2025, which are elinzanetant, a hormone-free treatment for menopause symptoms, and ceramides, a drug for the treatment of a certain form of heart disease. The Consumer Health segment also improved in 2024 due to the launch of new products, which should keep the momentum in 2025. However, sales in the Crop Science division declined significantly in the past couple of years due to lower volumes and prices for glyphosate-based products.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have risen 61.9% so far this year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nEstimates for its 2025 earnings per share have increased from $1.19 to $1.25 over the past 60 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: BAYRY\n\nPfizer: It is one of the largest and most successful drugmakers in the field of oncology. The company’s position in oncology was strengthened with the addition of Seagen in 2023. Though COVID revenues are declining, its non-COVID operational revenues are improving, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel, Padcev and Eliquis, new launches and newly acquired products like Nurtec and those from Seagen.\n\nPfizer faces its share of challenges, the key being declining sales of its COVID-19 products. It also expects a significant impact from the loss of patent exclusivity in the 2026-2030 period, as several of its key products may face patent expirations. The Medicare Part D redesign under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is also expected to negatively impact sales of Pfizer’s higher-priced drugs, such as Vyndaqel, Ibrance, Xtandi and Xeljanz,in 2025.\n\nHowever, as COVID-related uncertainties dwindle, its revenue volatility is also declining. The company’s non-COVID drugs and contribution from new and newly acquired products should continue to drive top-line growth in 2025. Also, Pfizer expects cost cuts and internal restructuring to deliver savings of at least $6.0 billion. Continued growth in non-COVID sales and significant cost-reduction measures should drive profit growth.\n\nPfizer has a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has risen from $2.98to $3.06 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has lost 4.2% year to date.\n\nPrice and Consensus: PFE\n\nNovartis: With the separation of Sandoz, Novartis has become a pure-play pharmaceutical company. Novartis maintains strong momentum on the back of a strong and diverse portfolio with drugs like Kisqali, Kesimpta, Pluvicto and Leqvio. The uptake of Pluvicto and Scemblix has been outstanding and should propel top-line growth. Approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs should enable Novartis to offset the adverse impacts of the generic competition of key drugs. Novartis is also looking to solidify its presence in the promising gene therapy space. The recent spate of acquisitions and collaborations has strengthened its pipeline. However, generic erosion of some drugs and recent pipeline setbacks are a concern.\n\nNovartis has a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Swiss drugmaker’s 2025 EPS has risen from $8.46 to $8.74 over the past 60 days. The stock has risen 25.6% so far this year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: NVS\n\nAbbVie: It has successfully navigated the loss of exclusivity (LOE) of its blockbuster drug, Humira, by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications and should support top-line growth in the next few years.\n\nAbbVie expects to return to robust revenue growth in 2025, which is just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE, driven by its ex-Humira platform.\n\nBoosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through 2029, as it has no significant LOE event for the rest of this decade. Strong sales performance of drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Venclexta and Vraylar, coupled with significant contributions from newer drugs like Ubrelvy, Elahere, Epkinly and Qulipta, should keep driving the company’s top line.\n\nAbbVie has several early/mid-stage pipeline candidates with blockbuster potential. The company expects several regulatory submissions, approvals and key data readouts in the next 12 months. The company has been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years, which is strengthening its pipeline.\n\nAbbVie has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. The stock has risen 9.5% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has remained stable at $12.28 per share over the past 60 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: ABBV\n\nSanofi: Dupixent has become the key top-line driver for Sanofi as it enjoys strong demand across all approved indications and geographies. New uses, increased penetration in approved indications and further geographic expansion are expected to drive Dupixent’s sales in future quarters.\n\nSanofi possesses a leading vaccine portfolio, which drives the top line. Several new drugs were launched in the past couple of years that have become significant contributors to Sanofi's accelerated top-line growth profile. Sanofi increased R&D investments and achieved significant progress with its pipeline in 2024. It has also been active on the M&A front. However, generic erosion of Aubagio in all key markets and lower sales from mature products are hurting sales. Other headwinds include the weak sales of influenza vaccines and regular negative pipeline developments.\n\nSanofi has a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The stock has risen 6.3% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has risen from $4.43 to $4.56 over the past 60 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: SNY\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Detailed data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting Monday showed treatment reduced vasomotor symptoms in women receiving endocrine therapy to treat or prevent hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\n\nVasomotor symptoms include hot flashes and disrupted sleep, and are typically associated with menopause. However, these symptoms can occur in almost 90% of women with early breast cancer who are treated with endocrine drugs. The side effects are disruptive enough to sometimes cause breast cancer patients to stop treatment, which could affect disease progression and, ultimately, survival.\n\nIn women experiencing menopause, hormone-replacement therapies can be used to treat vasomotor symptoms. But in women with early-stage breast cancer, those same treatments can increase the risk of their disease worsening or returning.\n\n“With no currently approved treatments for this indication, there is an unmet medical need for therapeutic options,” said Fatima Cardoso, the study’s lead investigator and the director of the breast cancer unit at the Champalimaud Cancer Center in Lisbon, Portugal, in a statement provided by Bayer.\n\nElinzanent provides a non-hormonal option. The drug targets two receptors, NK1 and NK3, that help regulate body temperature. In Oasis-4, 316 participants were randomly assigned to take elinzanetant once daily, while 157 received placebo. Vasomotor symptoms were assessed at one and three months. After 12 weeks, people who had been given placebo were switched to elinzanetant for the remainder of the main one-year evaluation period.\n\nResults showed that elinzanetant quickly alleviated symptoms at both weeks 4 and 12 compared to placebo, meeting the study’s primary goal. After one month, 61% of women taking the Bayer drug reported the frequency of daily moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms had been reduced by at least half. And at three months, women taking the drug experienced greater improvements in sleep and quality of life compared to those on placebo.\n\nTrial participants who switched to elinzanetant after taking a placebo for 12 weeks also experienced similar benefits.\n\n“It's due time that new innovation comes into this space,” said Yesmean Wahdan, vice president of U.S. medical affairs for Bayer’s women’s health unit, in an interview with BioPharma Dive. “[This therapy] really aims at targeting the source of what's causing the symptoms that are happening as the woman goes through the menopausal transition and into menopause.”\n\nThe Oasis-4 results were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine Monday.\n\nLast year, Bayer unveiled data from a Phase 3 study of women taking elinzanetant for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. The drug proved efficacious among this group of women as well, supporting an application by Bayer for approval.\n\n“[Menopause] is a condition many women will enter into and face no matter where you are in life,” Wahdan said. “Some enter it via clinical reasons. They're put on medications, they have surgery. And some of us enter it as a transition in life.”\n\nIf approved in women with vasomotor symptoms as a result of their breast cancer treatment, elinzanetant would be the first therapeutic of its kind.\n\n“It's a therapy that is targeted at all women who are experiencing these [vasomotor] symptoms,” Wahdan said. “We know that [women taking endocrine therapy] have, for a long time, been excluded from some of the more traditional therapies for symptoms of menopause.”\n\nOne approved non-hormonal option for vasomotor symptoms comes from Japanese pharmaceutical company Astellas Pharma, but it is not approved for women being treated for breast cancer. Called Veozah, the drug has struggled commercially due to weaker-than-expected demand and reimbursement issues. The Food and Drug Administration also recently added a safety warning for possible liver damage to the drug’s labeling.\n\nIn Oasis-4, almost 70% of women taking elinzanetant reported at least one adverse event, versus 62% of those in the placebo group. There were serious adverse events reported in eight women treated with Bayer’s drug. Most commonly, however, side effects were fatigue, headache and drowsiness.\n\nIn an editorial published in NEJM, Ann Partridge, interim chair of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s medical oncology department, noted that a better understanding of elinzanetant’s side effects will be essential to incorporating the drug in patient care.\n\n“Reassuringly, the present trial and previous trials of elinzanetant have shown no increased risk of toxic effects on the liver, which have been reported in rare cases with another agent in this class,” she wrote, referring to Veozah.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:05:51.584626+00:00"}

Similar to Eylea, Vabysmo is approved for a range of retinal diseases but has higher uptake due to the longer intervals between injections.\n\nGlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate? Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. By GlobalData Learn more about Strategic Intelligence\n\nVabysmo generated $4.3bn in sales in 2024, becoming one of Roche’s top-selling drugs. Whilst Eylea and Eylea 8mg – the latter known as Eylea HD in the US – reached combined sales of $9.5bn in 2024, year-over-year growth was lower than Vabysmo. Regeneron and Bayer are also having to contend with a market influx of biosimilars.\n\nTherefore, an extended treatment interval could be a major step for Bayer in maintaining its market share. The positive judgment by the committee was based on positive three-year results from open-label extension studies of the pivotal clinical trials PULSAR (NCT04423718) and PHOTON (NCT04429503) in nAMD and DME, respectively. Eylea 8mg demonstrated that it could maintain visual and anatomic improvements at dosing intervals of six months. Across both studies, 24% of patients in nAMD and 28% of patients in DME had a last assigned dosing gap of six months at the end of the three years.\n\nThe long-term data did not show any new safety signals, and the rates of ocular treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were similar across patients switching from 2mg to 8mg of Eylea.\n\nEylea works by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which prevents abnormal blood vessel growth. With the label extension, Eylea 8mg would be the only anti-VEGF approved for a treatment interval of six months. Roche’s Vabysmo became the first bispecific antibody approved for the eye. It acts by neutralising angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and VEGF-A.\n\nBayer’s global product strategy and commercialisation executive vice-president Christine Roth said: “Following approval of the European Commission, extended treatment intervals with Eylea 8mg of up to six months can significantly reduce the frequency of injections and visits to the clinic for patients.\n\n“These extended intervals, combined with the unique product profile of Eylea 8mg, position it to become a new standard of care for retinal diseases.”\n\nSign up for our daily news round-up!

Teliso-V, which will be marketed by the name of Emrelis, is the first-in-class therapy approved for the above-mentioned NSCLC patient group that often faces a poor prognosis and has limited treatment options. The approval was based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response data from the phase II LUMINOSITY study.\n\nFDA Approves MRK's Welireg for Rare Adrenal Tumors\n\nMerck announced that the FDA has granted approval to Welireg for the treatment of patients with advanced pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Currently, there are no approved therapies for treating these rare adrenal tumors. The FDA approval was based on ORR data from the phase II LITESPARK-015 study. This approval marks the third indication for Welireg in the United States. Welireg is currently approved in the United States for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma andsome von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors.\n\nMerck's phase III ovarian cancer study on a Keytruda regimen met its primary endpoint by showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival. The KEYNOTE-B96 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel) with or without bevacizumab in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer whose tumors expressed PD-L1 and in all comers. The study also met its secondary endpoint of overall survival for patients whose tumors express PD-L1. Keytruda is not presently approved to treat any indication in ovarian cancer.\n\nGSK Buys Rights to Phase III-Ready Liver Disease Candidate\n\nGSK announced that it is buying rights to clinical-stage biotech Boston Pharmaceuticals' lead pipeline candidate, efimosfermin alfa, to treat and prevent the progression of steatotic liver disease (SLD). In phase II studies, efimosfermin alfa has shown the potential to reverse liver fibrosis and stop its progression in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (\"MASH\"), a form of SLD.\n\nSLD affects approximately 5% of the global population and represents an area of significant unmet medical need with limited treatment options. Efimosfermin, with its direct antifibrotic mechanism of action, has the potential to establish a new standard of care for treating MASH.\n\nFor the deal, GSK will make an upfront payment of $1.2 billion to Boston Pharmaceuticals, with the latter also being entitled to potential milestone payments of $800 million.\n\nTrump's Most Favored Nations Policy\n\nThis week, the Trump administration issued an executive order that will push drugmakers to offer prescription drugs to U.S. cash-pay consumers at lower prices. The executive order will see U.S. consumers paying the same amount as the nation that pays the lowest price for that drug. He termed this policy the \"most favored nation policy.\" The President feels that the cost of prescription drugs in the United States is higher than in any other country, sometimes even five to ten times higher. Trump believes the order will result in a 30% to 80% decrease in prescription drug prices in the United States.\n\nThe order mentioned that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will create programs to let Americans buy drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies at the most-favored-nation, lowest price.

Also, how did The Hedge facility perform in FY25, and what is the guidance for FY26? A : The Hedge facility generated revenue of INR 40 crores in FY25, with a negative EBITDA of INR 14 crores. For FY26, revenue is expected to increase to INR 60 crores, with EBITDA remaining similar. Regarding the monsoon, both IMD and SkyMet have given a positive forecast, which is encouraging for planting.

A: B2B sales accounted for about 9% of total revenue, including technical sales of INR 40 crores, while 91% came from brand sales. Last year, B2B sales were about 4%. We are introducing a new fungicide product, expecting INR 10 crores in revenue, but it won't significantly impact EBITDA this year.\n\nQ: What is the total addressable market for the two fungicide molecules acquired from Bayer, and what revenue are you expecting from them in FY26 and FY27? A: The total addressable market for these molecules is approximately USD 100 million. We expect to generate INR 110 crores in revenue from these products in FY26, including both Indian and international sales. One product is focused on the Brazilian market, while the other is spread across more than 20 countries.\n\nQ: How do you plan to utilize the cash position, especially after the acquisition of the two products from Bayer? A: We maintain a healthy practice of rewarding shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We recently announced a 100% dividend. We will continue to explore strategic opportunities for cash utilization and will share updates as they arise.\n\nQ: How is the international market performing, and is it aligning with your expectations following the acquisition of the two fungicides? A: The international market presents a significant opportunity for us. The acquisition of these fungicides provides a gateway to expand our footprint in export markets, including Brazil, the world's largest agrochemical market. We are optimistic about the potential for these products to enhance our international presence.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:06:06.556382+00:00"}

A: Rodrigo Santos, Head of Crop Science, explained that excluding regulatory impacts, the core business would have grown by 2.4%. The corn business is expected to grow by 2.5% in Q1 due to accounting adjustments. Crop protection reported 2% growth, which would be 5% excluding regulatory impacts. The company remains confident in its guidance for the year, driven by innovation and core business health.\n\nQ: Can you provide an update on the glyphosate litigation and potential outcomes if the Supreme Court does not accept the case? A: William Anderson, CEO, stated that Bayer expects to hear from the Supreme Court in June or October. The company is not relying solely on this plan and is working with Congress for potential legislative solutions. Bayer is also considering structural options and remains open to settlements, provided they offer a high degree of finality.\n\nQ: How confident are you in the safety and efficacy of Asendexian, and what is the expected market potential? A: Stefan Oelrich, Head of Pharmaceuticals, expressed confidence in Asendexian's safety and efficacy, noting positive results from the Pacific program. The Phase III study targets populations with significant effects observed in Phase II. The market potential is substantial, especially if prevalent cases are included.\n\nQ: Could you elaborate on the state legislation efforts related to glyphosate and their significance? A: William Anderson highlighted that state legislation is crucial for providing certainty to manufacturers and signaling to Congress the need for federal clarification. Missouri is a key state due to the volume of lawsuits filed there. Bayer is pursuing legislation in additional states to support its position.\n\nQ: What are Bayer's expectations for corn acreage in the U.S., and how does it impact profitability compared to soy? A: Rodrigo Santos stated that Bayer is optimistic about high corn acreage in the U.S., potentially reaching 94-95 million acres. Corn is more profitable than soy, and Bayer expects growth in corn globally. The company is also focused on margin expansion through cost control and efficiency improvements.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:06:12.827927+00:00"}

The Insecticides business decreased 12.3% due to lower Movento sales in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region following the expiration of its registration in the EU. Sales at Cotton Seed were down 19.9% due to regulatory impacts in the United States.

While the stock has lost 6.4% over the past week, it could witness a trend reversal as a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session. This could mean that the bulls have been able to counteract the bears to help the stock find support.\n\nThe formation of a hammer pattern is considered a technical indication of nearing a bottom with likely subsiding of selling pressure. But this is not the only factor that makes a bullish case for the stock. On the fundamental side, strong agreement among Wall Street analysts in raising earnings estimates for this company enhances its prospects of a trend reversal.\n\n1-month candlestick chart for BAYRY\n\nWhat is a Hammer Chart and How to Trade It?\n\nThis is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'\n\nIn simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.\n\nWhen it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.\n\nHammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.\n\nLike every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.\n\nHere's What Increases the Odds of a Turnaround for BAYRY\n\nAn upward trend in earnings estimate revisions that BAYRY has been witnessing lately can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 4.7% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering BAYRY are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:06:40.748778+00:00"}

However, several lawsuits have been filed by people for the same, alleging that Monsanto’s herbicide caused them to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or related cancers.\n\nIt has also been alleged by plaintiffs that the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew, or should have known, of the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn its users.\n\nThe ongoing glyphosate litigation in the United States has adversely impacted Bayer’s cash position due to high legal costs.\n\nNonetheless, the company plans to appeal the latest verdict by the Georgia court and stated that it has secured favorable outcomes in 17 of the last 25 trials.\n\nBayer had earlier argued that leading health regulators worldwide have repeatedly concluded that its glyphosate products can be used safely and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.\n\nAccording to the company, in July 2024, a judge in the Federal Court of Australia (with the aid of a neutral, court-appointed scientific expert and following a scientific conclave process) found in a detailed 322-page opinion that the weight of scientific evidence does not support a link between glyphosate and NHL.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2024, Bayer’s provision for the glyphosate litigation totaled $5.9 billion.\n\nThe company also plans to file a petition for review with the U.S. Supreme Court in the ongoing glyphosate litigation.\n\nBAYRY’s Efforts to Combat Challenges\n\nBayer plans to pay out only the legally required minimum dividend in 2025, while also looking to reduce its debt. 2024 was a tough year for the company due to strong headwinds in the Crop Science business. The uncertainty caused by ongoing Roundup litigation is also a major hangover on the stock. BAYRY had earlier slashed its dividends to conserve cash, as increasing Roundup litigation charges had adversely impacted the bottom line.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:06:42.580056+00:00"}

In the Large-Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, AbbVie (ABBV), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Novartis (NVS), Pfizer (PFE) and Bayer (BAYRY) are worth retaining in one's portfolio", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-large-drug-stocks-watch-104700001.html", "published_at": "2025-03-25T10:47:00Z", "source": "Zacks", "text": "Innovation and Pipeline Success: For big drugmakers, an innovative pipeline is a competitive necessity and key to top-line growth. Pharma companies are continually striving to ramp up innovation and allocate a significant portion of their revenues to R&D. Several drugmakers are embracing AI technology to accelerate the drug discovery process for deliveringmore effective therapies. Successful innovation and product line extensions in key therapeutic areas, along with strong clinical study results, may serve as important catalysts for these stocks.\n\nContinuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies, and these large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions and collaboration deals are other key features of large drugmakers\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticalsindustry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi-million-dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas, like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health products, medical devices and consumer-related healthcare products.They invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already-marketed drugs.\n\nThe drug and biotech sector has recovered over the past couple of months, following a slow start to the year, primarily due to the better-than-expected fourth-quarter performance of large drugmakers and an overall optimistic outlook for the year. Innovation is at its peak for the industry, with key spaces like rare diseases, next-generation oncology treatments, obesity, immunology and neuroscience attracting investor attention. R&D innovation is likely to remain a major focus area in 2025 . M&A activity is also expected to remain strong, particularly with Trump’s return to the White House. Regular pipeline setbacks, slow ramp-up of newer drugs, patent cliffs, regulatory risks and broader market concerns related to the economy are some of the headwinds for the sector. There remains uncertainty about how Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new Health Secretary, will treat the drug and biotech sector as he is known to be a vaccine skeptic. Nonetheless, large drugmakers have several robust revenue streams and are mostly profitable companies, which make them safe havens for investments. Among the large drugmakers, AbbVie ABBV, Novo Nordisk NVO, Novartis NVS, Pfizer PFE and Bayer BAYRY are worth retaining in one’s portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAggressive M&A & Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&A activities. Given that it takes several years and millions ofdollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies, sitting on substantial cash reserves, regularly acquire innovative small and mid-cap biotech companies to expand their pipelines.\n\nAlso, sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices and the growing use of AI for drug discovery whet the M&A appetite of large drugmakers.Moreover, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing.Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&A activities. Recently, areas such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease have been attracting buyout interest.\n\nAn important M&A deal announced this year was J&J’s offer to buy Intra-Cellular Therapies for approximately $14.6 billion. M&A activity is expected to remain rampant in 2025.\n\nPipeline Setbacks & Other Headwinds: Thefailure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments, a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs, Medicare drug price negotiations and increasing FTC scrutiny of M&A deals.\n\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty: Escalating geopolitical tensions in various parts of the world, like the Russia-Ukraine war and increasing tensions between the United States and China and their impact on global economic growth and macroeconomic uncertainty, have increased economic woes.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bright Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industryis a 12-stock group within the broader Medicalsector. The group’s Zacks Industry Rankis basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #67, which places it in the top 27% of 247 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBefore we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let’s take a look at the industry’s performance and its current valuation.\n\nIndustry Versus S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe industry has outpaced the Zacks Medical Sector as well as the S&P 500 year to date.\n\nStocks in this industry have collectively risen 6.3% so far this year compared with the Zacks Medical Sector’s growth of 4.3%. In contrast, the Zacks S&P 500 composite has declined 4.1%.\n\nYTD Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 16.69X compared with the S&P 500’s 20.77X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 20.56X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 20.80X, as low as 12.92X and at a median of 15.13X, as the chart below shows.\n\nForward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\n5 Large Drugmakers to Watch\n\nNovo Nordisk: The company has a strong presence in the Diabetes care market, with one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. NVO’s success in the past few years is underscored by its semaglutide (GLP-1 agonist) medicines, which are marketed as Ozempic and Rybelsus for type II diabetes and Wegovy for obesity and are seeing great demand trends and driving the top line. Label expansions of its semaglutide medicines in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales.\n\nNovo Nordisk has been addressing the supply constraints of Wegovy by making investments to increase production. Moreover, the FDA removed Wegovy from the shortage list in late February, which means the agency is confident that the company can meet its current and future demand.\n\nNovo Nordisk is making good progress with its pipeline, which includes several other new candidates for type-II diabetes and obesity as well as candidates for treating haemophilia.\n\nNVO has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has risen from $3.84 to $3.93 over the past 30 days. The stock has lost 12.5% so far this year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: NVO\n\nBayer: The company’s key drugs, Nubeqa for cancer and Kerendia for chronic kidney disease associated with type II diabetes, are fueling growth in its Pharmaceuticals division. It is also working to expand the labels of Nubeqa and Kerendia, which, if successful, can further drive growth.\n\nBayer also plans to launch two new drugs in 2025, which are elinzanetant, a hormone-free treatment for menopause symptoms, and ceramides, a drug for the treatment of a certain form of heart disease. The Consumer Health segment also improved in 2024 due to the launch of new products. However, sales in the Crop Science division declined significantly in the past couple of years due to lower volumes and prices for glyphosate-based products.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 company’s shares have risen 23.9% so far this year. Estimates for its 2025 earnings per share have increased from $1.14 to $1.20 over the past 30 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: BAYRY\n\nPfizer: It is one of the largest and most successful drugmakers in the field of oncology. The company’s position in oncology was strengthened with the addition of Seagen in December 2023. After possibly experiencing its worst slowdown in 2023/2024, Pfizer appears to be gradually making a comeback and entering a transition phase. Though COVID revenues are declining, its non-COVID operational revenues improved in 2024, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel, Padcev and Eliquis, new launches and newly acquired products like Nurtec and those from Seagen.\n\nPfizer faces its share of challenges, the key being declining sales of its COVID-19 products. It also expects a significant impact from the loss of patent exclusivity in the 2026-2030 period, as several of its key products may face patent expirations. The Medicare Part D redesign under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is also expected to negatively impact sales of Pfizer’s higher-priced drugs, such as Vyndaqel, Ibrance, and Xeljanz, in 2025.\n\nHowever, as COVID-related uncertainties dwindle, its revenue volatility is also declining. The company’s non-COVID drugs and contribution from new and newly acquired products should continue to drive top-line growth in 2025. Also, Pfizer expects cost cuts and internal restructuring to deliver savings of at least $6.0 billion. Continued growth in non-COVID sales and significant cost-reduction measures should drive profit growth.\n\nPfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS has risen from $2.95to $2.97 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has lost 1.7% year to date.\n\nPrice and Consensus: PFE\n\nAbbVie: Sales of AbbVie’s blockbuster drug, Humira, are declining due to loss of exclusivity and biosimilar erosion. However, the company has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity (LOE) by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications. This should support top-line growth in the next few years.\n\nStrong sales performance of drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Venclexta and Vraylar, coupled with significant contributions from newer drugs like Ubrelvy, Elahere, Epkinly and Qulipta, should keep driving the company’s top line in 2025.\n\nHowever, AbbVie is witnessing declining sales of Juvederm fillers in the United States and China due to challenging market conditions, which might be a headwind in 2025. AbbVie also faces other headwinds, such as Humira biosimilar erosion, increasing competitive pressure on cancer drug Imbruvica and regular pipeline setbacks.\n\nNonetheless, boosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through 2029, as it has no significant LOE event for the rest of this decade. A substantial portion of this growth is expected to be driven by the robust performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\n\nAbbVie has several early/mid-stage pipeline candidates with blockbuster potential. The company anticipates several regulatory submissions, approvals, and key data readouts within the next 12 months. It has been on an acquisition spree in the past couple of years, which is strengthening its pipeline.\n\nAbbVie has a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nThe stock has risen 17.7% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has risen from $12.28 to $12.30 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: ABBV\n\nNovartis: With the separation of Sandoz, Novartis has become a pure-play pharmaceutical company. Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio. Its new oncology drugs, such as Pluvicto, Scemblix, and Kisqali , put up a stellar performance in 2024. Other drugs, such as Cosentyx, Entresto, and Kesimpta, as well as newer drugs like Leqvio and Fabhlata, are expected to contribute significantly to the top line in the coming years. Backed by strong momentum across all key drugs, the solid top-line performance is expected to continue in 2025.\n\nNovartis is also looking to solidify its presence in the promising gene therapy space. The recent spate of acquisitions and collaborations has strengthened its pipeline.\n\nNovartis has a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Swiss drugmaker’s 2025 EPS has risen from $8.45 to $8.47 over the past 60 days. The stock has risen 14.1% so far this year.\n\nPrice and Consensus: NVS\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The agrochemical giant says it will appeal the verdict, reached in a Georgia courtroom late Friday, in efforts to overturn the decision.\n\nThe penalties awarded include $65 million in compensatory damages and $2 billion in punitive damages, law firms Arnold & Itkin LLP and Kline & Specter PC said in a statement. That marks one of the largest verdicts in a Roundup-related case to date.\n\nPlaintiff John Barnes filed his lawsuit against Monsanto in 2021, seeking damages related to his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Arnold & Itkin attorney Kyle Findley, the lead trial lawyer on the case, said the verdict will help put his client in a better position to get the treatment he needs going forward.\n\n“It’s been a long road for him ... and he was happy that the truth related to the product (has) been exposed,” Findley told The Associated Press on Sunday. He called the verdict an “important milestone” after \"another example of Monsanto’s refusal to accept responsibility for poisoning people with this toxic product.”\n\nGermany-based Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in 2018, has continued to dispute claims that Roundup causes cancer. But the company has been hit with more than 177,000 lawsuits involving the weedkiller and set aside $16 billion to settle cases.\n\nIn a statement, Monsanto said Friday's verdict “conflicts with the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and the consensus of regulatory bodies and their scientific assessments worldwide.” The company added that it continues “to stand fully behind the safety” of Roundup products.\n\nFor a variety of crops — including corn, soybeans and cotton — Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist the weedkiller’s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less.\n\nSome studies associate Roundup’s key ingredient, glyphosate, with cancer, although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. Still, numerous lawsuits over the weedkiller allege glyphosate does cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma, arguing that Monsanto has failed to warn the public about serious risks for years.\n\nFindley said that evidence relating to Barnes' case show “many years of cover-ups\" and “backroom dealings.” He accused Monsanto of ignoring several scientific studies related to the toxicity of Roundup and said the company “tried to find ways to persuade and distract and deny the connection between this product and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:43:30.699129+00:00"}

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.\n\nLooking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.\n\nOn top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the \"Value\" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and \"A\" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.\n\nOne company to watch right now is Bayer (BAYRY). BAYRY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.67. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 16.85. Over the past 52 weeks, BAYRY's Forward P/E has been as high as 5.97 and as low as 3.72, with a median of 5.14.\n\nFinally, investors will want to recognize that BAYRY has a P/CF ratio of 7.98. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 25.84. Within the past 12 months, BAYRY's P/CF has been as high as 7.98 and as low as 3.59, with a median of 5.46.\n\nThese are just a handful of the figures considered in Bayer's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that BAYRY is an impressive value stock right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nRegeneron Beats on Q4 Earnings, Initiates Quarterly Dividend\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings per share (EPS) of $12.07, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.62. The company recorded an EPS of $11.86 in the year-ago period.\n\nThe upside in the bottom line can be attributed to higher revenues.\n\nTotal revenues increased 10% year over year to $3.79 billion, fueled by increased collaboration revenues from Sanofi for Dupixent, higher Eylea HD and Libtayo sales. Revenues marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.78 billion.\n\nMore on Q4 Performance\n\nEylea’s sales in the United States declined 11% year over year to $1.2 billion, primarily due to increased competition.\n\nPlease note that Regeneron co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG. Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States and Bayer does the same outside the country. The company records its share of profits in connection with Eylea sales outside the United States as collaboration revenues.\n\nIn August 2023, the FDA approved Eylea HD (higher dose of Eylea) for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy.\n\nEylea HD generated revenues of $305 million in the United States, driven by the addition of new patients and the transition of patients from Eylea.\n\nTotal Eylea and Eylea HD sales in the United States were $1.49 billion, up 2% year over year. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.29%.\n\nTotal Eylea HD and Eylea net product sales were favorably impacted by approximately $85 million as a result of higher wholesaler inventory levels for Eylea, partially offset by lower wholesaler inventory levels for Eylea HD.\n\nTotal revenues include collaboration revenues of $1.61 billion from Sanofi and Bayer. The figure increased 17.3% from that recorded in the year-ago quarter. Total collaboration revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69 billion.\n\nSanofi’s collaboration revenues increased 22% to $1.2 billion, driven by profits associated with higher Dupixent sales. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.3 billion. We note that Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent and Kevzara, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with the global sales of both drugs. Dupixent’s sales increased 15% year over year to $3.7 billion.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:43:50.449577+00:00"}

Currency exchange rates hurt the company’s results, Bayer said. In 2023, Bayer reported a net loss of 2.94 billion euros, or 2.99 euros a share, on revenue of 47.6 billion euros.\n\nNext year will be “difficult in terms of financial performance,” with sales little changed from 2024 and earnings and cash flow falling behind the previous year, Anderson said in prepared remarks. “We see an improved trajectory starting in 2026.”\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBayer has been around since 1863, growing from a two-man partnership focused on making dyes to one of the largest players in pharmaceuticals, consumer health and crop science. But the company’s shares have been in steady decline for almost eight years amid sluggish financial results.\n\nAnderson became CEO in 2023 promising a “radical realignment” of Bayer’s internal culture that would shed layers of bureaucracy and make the company more nimble and profitable. In the latest earnings announcement, he said the company would be adding profitability at the crop science division to its list of focus areas along with a five-year plan to improve earnings.\n\nThe outlook boosted Bayer’s American depositary receipts, which rose more than 6%, to $6.60 apiece, in early trading Wednesday. They have gradually been recovering from a sharp drop in November, when Bayer lowered 2025 earnings guidance. The ADRs traded above $33 in October 2017.\n\nAnderson has so far resisted calls to shed any of the company’s main business units, as rivals such as Merck & Co., Johnson & Johnson and Novartis have done. “We have three great businesses, with attractive long-term prospects,” Anderson said Wednesday. “We expect them to compete at the forefront of their fields. Whenever that’s not the case, we’re going to take action.”\n\nIn pharmaceuticals, Bayer is fighting through the expiration of patent protection for Xarelto, but Anderson said the company is “rejuvenating” its pipeline and expects to soon reap the rewards of that effort. Growth in the unit should return in 2027, with margins starting to expand in 2028, Anderson said.\n\nGrowth will be led by the company’s Nubeqa prostate cancer drug and Kerendia kidney disease treatment, which together should bring in sales of more than 2.5 billion euros in 2025, Anderson said.\n\nThe company is also planning to launch two drugs it sees as future top sellers. In April, Bayer expects to start booking European sales of the heart medicine Beyonttra which, according to development partner BridgeBio Pharma, has caught on quickly with U.S. doctors. The company also hoping to start selling a menopause drug called elinzanetant in the U.S. later this year.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:43:55.779723+00:00"}

Adjusted earnings per share of $4.04, also came in ahead of estimates of $3.81.\n\nGary Millerchip, CFO at Costco (COST), said in an earnings call at the time that trade tariffs were \"not something that we see as a positive in general\".\n\n\"We believe that our merchants and buyers are equipped ...

Meanwhile, operating profit is set to have increased to €1.3bn, marking significant growth from the €268m the company reported in 2023.\n\nRead more: The underperforming 'dog' funds that have gobbled up more than £67bn\n\nBjørn Gulden, CEO of Adidas (ADS.DE), said: \"There is a lot of macroeconomic uncertainty right now, but we clearly have the goal to again grow double-digit with the adidas brand and use that growth to continue to improve our operating profit and make further progress towards our 10% margin target.\"\n\nAdidas (ADS.DE) is due publish its final set of financial results for 2024 and issue financial guidance for 2025 on Wednesday 5 March.\n\nIn a note published on Thursday, Bank of America analysts said: \"The group intends to announce a credible financial guidance for 2025, reducing the risk of pre-releases during the year, and of ending the year with an EBIT [earnings before interest and tax] and an organic sales growth (OSG) at >2x the initial guidance (like what we saw in 2024).\n\n\"This does not mean, in our view, that management does not intend to leave room for some guidance upgrades and/or for the possibility to report (slightly) above guidance results.\"\n\nGreggs (GRG.L) – Releases preliminary full-year results on Tuesday 4 March\n\nShares in Greggs (GRG.L) slumped in January, after it warned of higher costs this year, as well as noting a slowdown in sales growth.\n\nIn a January trading update, giving a glimpse into what it expected to report for the fourth quarter and full-year, Greggs (GRG.L) said total sales were up 11.3% to reach a record of more than £2bn ($2.52bn) for 2024.\n\nHowever, like-for-like sales growth for the year of 5.5% came in below the 6.3% expected by analysts. For the fourth quarter, like-for-like sales grew 2.5%, which which was down from the 5% increase it reported in the third quarter. This was also down from the 9.4% growth the business posted for the same period last year.\n\nGreggs (GRG.L) CEO Roisin Currie noted that \"lower consumer confidence continues to impact high street footfall and expenditure\" but believed that the company was well positioned to \"meet the headwinds we expect to see in the year ahead\".\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nIn its outlook for 2025, Greggs (GRG.L) warned that \"employment costs will result in further overall cost inflation, although wage increases should provide support to consumers\". A number of UK businesses have warned of higher employment costs on the back of increases to employer national insurance contributions and the national minimum wage, announced in the autumn budget.\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L), said Greggs (GRG.L) is expected to report an increase just shy of 12% in pre-tax profits for the year.\n\n\"Investors will have a few key priorities in focus,\" he said. \"First, the 2025 cost outlook looms large, particularly how tax changes off the back of Rachel Reeve’s budget will affect margins. Next, consumer spending in the fourth quarter will be critical – especially with consumer goods firms already warning of a soft start to 2025, a trend Greggs (GRG.L) will likely echo.\"\n\n\"Finally, the company’s growth engines – store expansion, evening trade, and digital channels – need to show sustained progress to reassure markets that Greggs can keep pushing forward despite the sector headwinds,\" he said.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 3 March\n\nBunzl (BNZL.L)\n\nSenior (SNR.L)\n\nTuesday 4 March\n\nAbrdn (ABDN.L)\n\nApax Global Alpha (APAX.L)\n\nAshtead (AHT.L)\n\nBakkavor Group (BAKK.L)\n\nBeazley (BEZ.L)\n\nDirect Line (DLG.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nInchcape (INCH.L)\n\nIntertek Group (ITRK.L)\n\nIWG (IWG.L)\n\nKeller Group (KLR.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nSpirent Communications (SPT.L)\n\nWeir Group (WEIR.L)\n\nAramco (2222.SR)\n\nPrada (1913.HK)\n\nSea (SE)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nContinental (CON.DE)\n\nDavide Campari Milano (CPR.MI)\n\nAutoZone (AZO)\n\nFlutter Entertainment (FLTR.L)\n\nBestBuy (BBY)\n\nMacy’s (M)\n\nUrban Outfitters (URBN)\n\nNordstrom (JWN)\n\nWednesday 5 March\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nIbstock (IBST.L)\n\nQuilter (QLT.L)\n\nDowlais (DWL.L)\n\nSIG (SHI.L)\n\nRicardo (RCDO.L)\n\nNetcall (NET.L)\n\nAdidas (ADS.DE)\n\nBayer (BAYN.DE)\n\nSandoz (SDZ.SW)\n\nDassault Aviation (AM.PA)\n\nAIB (A5G.IR)\n\nEvonik (EVK.DE)\n\nMarvell (MRVL)\n\nBrown-Forman (BF-B)\n\nCampbell Soup (CPB)\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF)\n\nThursday 6 March\n\nAdmiral Group (ADM.L)\n\nCoats Group (COA.L)\n\nElementis (ELM.L)\n\nEndeavour Mining (EDV.L)\n\nEntain (ENT.L)\n\nGrafton Group (GFTU.L)\n\nHarbour Energy (HBR.L)\n\nHunting (HTG.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nLancashire Holdings (LRE.L)\n\nMelrose Industries (MRO.L)\n\nPagegroup (PAGE.L)\n\nReckitt Benckiser Group (RKT.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nSchroders (SDR.L)\n\nSpire Healthcare Group (SPI.L)\n\nVesuvius (VSVS.L)\n\nRobert Walters (RWA.L)\n\nFunding Circle (FCH.L)\n\nDalata Hotels (DAL.L)\n\nCoats (COA.L)\n\nDHL (DHL.DE)\n\nUniversal Music (UMG.AS)\n\nZalando (ZAL.DE)\n\nLufthansa (LHA.DE)\n\nSolvay (SOLB.BR)\n\nVivendi (VIV.PA)\n\nAir France-KLM (AF.PA)\n\nKroger (KR)\n\nHP Enterprises (HPE)\n\nGap (GAP)\n\nFriday 7 March\n\nJust Group (JUST.L)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:43:59.635432+00:00"}

Shortly after he became CEO of Bayer AG in 2023, CEO Bill Anderson began waging war against bureaucracy to make the life science giant more nimble, more customer-focused, and more efficient. In this week’s Leadership Next podcast, he talks about how it’s going.\n\n“If I had arrived 10 years earlier, I don't know that we could have made these changes,” says Anderson. “When I arrived, what I found was a company where there was a really nice culture but people were burdened by the rules … so many rules that nobody can even keep track of them.”\n\nSo how do you redesign a 161-year-old, 100,000-person company without unleashing chaos? He focused on changing the mechanics: Get rid of rules, org charts, annual plans and the decision-making hierarchy. Anderson flattened the structure. He created thousands of teams, each of which has a vision—and goals to achieve that vision—on a 90-day cycle. “The clock's ticking every 90 days,” he says. “There’s no safe place to hide behind a budget target. Do it, go fast, deliver better for customers, use the least resources. And we'll talk about how you did four times a year. And, by the way, your peers are going to rate you.”\n\n“It helped that I've been doing this work for about seven years before I arrived at Bayer,” says Anderson, who was previously CEO of Roche’s Pharmaceuticals division after being CEO of Genentech.\n\n“What I found was that the bigger the organization, the more it prevented people from just doing what they needed to do. After 20 years, I said, ‘Hey, I'm not going to do this anymore. I'm either going to find a very different way to organize, or I'm done. I can't live with myself just turning the corporate crank one more year.”\n\nYou can listen to the full podcast here.\n\nMore news below.\n\nContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady, diane.brady@fortune.com, LinkedIn.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:44:01.588216+00:00"}

But this year, Bayer and a coalition of agricultural groups are doubling down. A broader media campaign is highlighting the importance of glyphosate-based Roundup for American agriculture. And they are getting help from a group that ran a Super Bowl ad in Missouri asserting the legislation is necessary to combat Chinese influence over the U.S. food supply.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOpponents, including those who rallied Monday in Des Moines, say the bills would limit the rights of people to hold companies accountable if their products cause harm. Speakers took turns telling stories of family members throughout the state who have been diagnosed with cancers and shouted out to lawmakers that Iowa's people are more important than corporate profits.\n\n“I feel like we need accountability here in Iowa,” said Nick Schutt, a part-time farmer whose mother, father, aunt and two siblings have all had cancer diagnoses. “At the end of the day, multinational chemical companies like Bayer should be held accountable.\"\n\nBayer disputes the claims that Roundup causes cancer, but the company has been hit with about 177,000 lawsuits involving the weedkiller and has set aside $16 billion to settle cases. It contends those legal costs are “not sustainable” and is looking for relief from lawmakers concerned about the possibility that Roundup could be pulled from the U.S. market.\n\nFor crops including corn, soybeans and cotton, Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist the weedkiller’s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more crops while conserving the soil by tilling it less.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“It is the most important product in global agriculture,” Liza Lockwood, Bayer's medical affairs lead in its crop science division, said during a recent Missouri Senate committee hearing.\n\nSome farmers have echoed that assertion. If lawsuits force Roundup off the U.S. market, they contend that Chinese-made products may be the only alternative.\n\n“Losing access to this one safe and effective tool will set off a domino effect that will threaten family farmers and our state’s economy,” Kevin Ross, a farmer from southwest Iowa, said to Iowa lawmakers. Ross detailed how, for 50 years, the American-made product has increased soil quality, decreased water runoff and helped struggling farmers turn a profit.\n\nAn expanded field for legislation\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLast year, Bayer focused its lobbying efforts on Missouri, Iowa and Idaho — home, respectively, to its North America crop science division, a Roundup manufacturing facility and the phosphate mines from which its key ingredient is derived. Though bills passed at least one chamber in Iowa and Missouri, they ultimately failed in all three states.\n\nThis year, legislation providing legal protection against failure-to-warn claims already has passed the North Dakota House without any opposition. Similar bills have cleared initial committees in Iowa, Mississippi and Missouri and are pending in legislative committees in Florida, Oklahoma and Tennessee. A bill failed to get out of a Wyoming committee by a deadline.\n\nBayer officials said Monday that legislative efforts also are in the works in Georgia, Idaho and the U.S. Congress. A promotional campaign from the Modern Ag Alliance, a coalition that Bayer supports, has targeted an even wider array of states.\n\nNew to the cause this year is the Protecting America Initiative, an organization concerned about China’s influence on the U.S. economy and tied to Richard Grenell, President Donald Trump’s envoy for special missions and former acting director of national intelligence. The group ran a television ad Sunday in central Missouri during the Super Bowl urging support for the legislation. It said it has invested six figures to run the 30-second spot more broadly across Missouri and Iowa.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt also parked a truck containing a portable billboard outside the Iowa Capitol on Monday, encouraging support of the bill to stop Chinese-made chemicals from “infiltrating American farms.”\n\nConcerns about cancer and pesticides\n\nAds supporting legislation that could limit Bayer's legal liability have emphasized the importance of its weed-control products to agriculture.\n\n\"Farming’s hard,” one Facebook advertisement says. “But it’s a little easier with glyphosate.”\n\nThat ad offended Kim Hagemann, a suburban Des Moines resident who showed up to a crowded subcommittee meeting to share her opposition with lawmakers.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Bayer is right, farming’s hard, but dealing with cancer is even harder,” said Hagemann, a member of one of the groups that organized Monday's protest.\n\nThough some studies associate Roundup's key ingredient glyphosate with cancer, the EPA has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. Yet the numerous lawsuits against Bayer allege glyphosate does cause a cancer called non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nOne of the many attorneys involved in the lawsuits against Bayer is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee to serve as secretary of Health and Human Services. Though the health agency oversees the Food and Drug Administration, it does not control the EPA and its labeling requirements.\n\nThe legislation supported by Bayer would provide a defense against failure-to-warn claims not only for Roundup but for other pesticide products that follow EPA labeling guidelines.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRichard Deming, a cancer physician in Des Moines, said it often takes decades to determine a cause-and-effect connection between cancer and long-term exposure to low levels of chemicals. He said public policy should focus on mitigating that risk, not providing “immunity from responsibility.”\n\n“I don’t think that ag chemicals causes as much cancer as cigarette smoking,\" Deming told the AP after speaking to lawmakers. But studies suggest \"there’s clear association between ag chemical exposure in the state of Iowa and cancer incidence.”\n\n___\n\nLieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:44:06.981948+00:00"}

The study randomized 474 women to receive treatment or a placebo and measured the effects after four and 12 weeks.\n\nThe announcement represents the fourth positive late-stage study result for elinzanetant, but the first that isn’t in menopausal women. Bayer has already submitted the drug for U.S. approval in postmenopausal women, and the Food and Drug Administration accepted its application in October. If cleared by regulators, the drug would compete with Astellas Pharma’s Veozah.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSo-called vasomotor symptoms are typically associated with menopause and, in over one third of menopausal women, can be severe, according to Bayer. But they’re also a side effect of endocrine therapies used to treat or prevent the most common form of breast cancer, which can impact adherence to those medicines.\n\nBayer believes elinzanetant may be helpful in treating both groups of women and, through four Phase 3 trials, has now accumulated enough evidence to suggest it can.\n\nIn the latest study, Bayer said elinzanetant met all of its main and secondary objectives. Though it didn’t provide specifics, the company said elinzanetant reduced the frequency and severity of hot flashes versus placebo at four and 12 weeks. Treatment was also associated with reduced symptom severity after one week, maintained its potency throughout the evaluation period and helped improve sleep.\n\nThe company also said the drug’s safety profile was “generally consistent” with previous testing.\n\n“The positive results from Oasis 4 bring us one step closer to a much-needed non-hormonal option for managing VMS in breast cancer patients and women at risk of breast cancer,” said study investigator Fatima Cardoso, in a statement provided by Bayer.\n\nBayer’s drug works by blocking receptors known as neurokinin 1 and 3, or NK1 and NK3, which are involved in regulating body temperature. The drug’s mechanism is similar to that of its main competitor, Veozah, which targets the NK3 protein. Veozah is approved to treat symptoms of menopause and is also in Phase 3 testing in women receiving endocrine therapy. The study began last August and has a primary completion date in late 2026, according to a federal database.\n\nAstellas has struggled to grow sales of Veozah amid low demand and trouble securing reimbursement. The Food and Drug Administration also recently issued a safety warning for the risk of rare but potentially severe livery injury after a report of signs of possible liver damage in a patient receiving treatment for about 40 days.\n\nBayer intends to present full details from the latest study, named Oasis 4, at upcoming medical meetings.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:44:20.173629+00:00"}

The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) to J&J’s JNJ nipocalimab for Sjögren’s disease. Merck MRK acquired rights to a novel cancer therapy from a China-based private biotech.\n\nHere's a recap of the week’s most important stories.\n\nAZN Tops Q3 Earnings and Sales Estimates, Guides Higher\n\nAstraZeneca’s third-quarter results were better than expected, as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales. Core earnings of $2.08 per share rose 27% year over year at constant exchange rates (CER), while revenues rose 21%. Revenues increased across all segments, with sales of most of the key drugs, including Tagrisso, Fasenra, Farxiga, Lynparza and Symbicort, beating estimates. AstraZeneca raised its sales and earnings growth expectations for the year. It expects total revenues and core earnings per share to increase by a high teens percentage compared with the previous guidance of an increase in the mid-teens percentage at CER.\n\nRecently, there have been rising concerns about the ongoing investigations at AstraZeneca China. With respect to the investigations, chief executive officer, Pascal Soriot, said that the company is aware that Chinese authorities are investigating some current and former AstraZeneca employees for medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation and personal information breaches. The company went on to say that it has not received any notification about investigations on AstraZeneca China.\n\nAstraZeneca announced plans to invest $3.5 billion by 2026 to expand its R&D and manufacturing footprint in the United States. This includes a new capital investment of $2 billion that will create more than 1,000 jobs.\n\nAstraZeneca and partner Merck announced positive data from the phase III KOMET study evaluating Koselugo in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN). Data from the study showed that Koselugo reduced the size of plexiform neurofibromas, benign tumors that grow in the tissue surrounding nerves, in adults with NF1. Koselugo is presently approved in some countries, including the United States and EU, for the treatment of certain pediatric patients with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable PN. The KOMET study looks to expand the use of Koselugo beyond pediatric patients to also treat adult patients for whom there are no approved targeted therapies.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:44:32.296883+00:00"}

Bayer and other business partners list and monetize these models on Microsoft's online catalog, which can be used by other companies to make customer service chatbots or enhance decision-making in factories and farm fields.\n\nThose using Bayer's models can tap into a trove of company data to answer questions about how to best grow crops. Microsoft said Bayer's model \"stands out\" due to its \"scalability to farm operations of all types and sizes and customization capabilities that allow organizations to adapt the model to regional and crop-specific requirements.\"\n\nFerrero invests to reduce herbicide use in hazelnut farming\n\nNutella maker Ferrero awarded $340,000 in research grants to study disease resistance and ways to reduce herbicide use in hazelnut farming.\n\nThe company's Ferrero Hazelnut Company division gave $180,000 to Oregon State University to support research into slashing herbicide use through biological control of invasive species, diseases and fungi. Ferrero recently doubled its sourcing from Oregon's Willamette Valley, and awarded more than $760,000 to OSU agriculture programs.\n\nFerrero also gave $170,000 to Rutgers University in New Jersey as part of a long-term disease study researching the development of hazelnut varieties resistant to Eastern filbert blight. EFB has been a significant roadblock to establishing hazelnut orchards outside of the Pacific Northwest. The fungus eventually reached its way to Washington and Oregon in the 1960s, and has challenged growers ever since.\n\n\"With Ferrero's generous support, our program is helping to unlock hazelnut production in eastern North America while providing a means to combat this disease if it spreads to new regions of the world,\" Thomas Molnar, associate professor at Rutgers University School of Environmental and Biological Sciences, said in a statement.\n\nFarmQA acquires digital scouting tool Farm Dog\n\nFarmQA, a provider of crop monitoring and soil sampling tools, said it acquired competitor Farm Dog, a digital platform for farmers' field scouting records.\n\nThe purchase bolsters FarmQA's customer base and agronomy capabilities, according to a statement. The deal will also allow Farm Dog owner Deveron to focus on its core mission of soil science and testing.\n\nFarmQA has expanded its managed acreage to over 30 million acres from 2.7 million at the end of 2021. Founded in 2015, the platform allows farmers to get a \"comprehensive overview of their operations, including field information, crop scouting reports, weather data, spray records, satellite imagery, and more,\" according to the company's website.\n\n\"The acquisition of Farm Dog's innovative data technology is a transformative step in further enhancing FarmQA's position as a leader in the ag tech market,\" Kris Poulson, CEO of FarmQA, said in a statement. \"This strategic move strengthens our ability to provide agriculture professionals, including agronomists and growers, with precision tools and actionable insights that span the entire crop production cycle.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:44:33.930294+00:00"}

A: If Dicamba is not registered by early next year, it will be difficult for farmers to access it for the season.

A: We are not prepared to quantify the decline yet, but we are executing on DSO savings, with 5,500 positions reduced this year, contributing to $500 million in savings. We are focused on cash conversion and reducing net financial debt. (Wolfgang Nickl, CFO)\n\nQ: What is the expected impact of Xarelto's patent expiry, and how do you see the market dynamics playing out?

Those dynamics, along with regulatory pressure around two of Bayer's blockbuster herbicides, are likely to contribute to more earnings losses in 2025.\n\n“Overall, we expect a muted outlook on top and bottom line next year with likely declining earnings,\" Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Nickl said in a statement.\n\nCEO Bill Anderson has slashed jobs and reorganized the company's operating model as part of a number of sweeping changes to get the business back on track. Bayer has held off on plans to break up its businesses for three years as the company works to shore up its finances.\n\nAnderson urged investors to remain patient, saying he remains confident in the company's strategy and emphasizing stronger performance in the consumer health and pharmaceuticals businesses. In crop sciences, Bayer is focused on introducing new innovations while battling litigation challenges around its RoundUp herbicide that's cost the company billions of dollars.\n\nBayer also is facing regulatory pressure around dicamba after the weedkiller was pulled from the market by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year. The company is working to regain approval, but the uncertainty has created financial headwinds.\n\n\"Even as we see great progress in some areas, others require more attention,\" Anderson said in a third quarter earnings call on Tuesday. \"That’s part of doing business. Sometimes you have to navigate twists and turns in the road, and adjust. It’s okay to do that, as long as you’re on the right path.\"\n\nWeather and disease challenges in Latin America dragged down Bayer's profits in the third quarter.

For the first half overall, a year-on-year decline in sales of around 20% is expected, with total revenues potentially dipping to £1.1bn, a drop from the £1.3bn reported in the same period the previous year.\n\nInvestors and analysts are keeping a close eye on rumours that Italy’s Moncler may be considering a takeover bid, speculation that has at least buoyed Burberry’s stock from its low point earlier this summer. But the main focus is set on the company’s first-half results, which are expected to reflect the ongoing struggles.\n\nNow, the spotlight shifts to Joshua Schulman, Burberry’s newly appointed CEO, tasked with steering the company through these choppy waters. Schulman is a veteran in the luxury sector with leadership experience at Coach, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors.\n\n“Demand in China is not recovering as quickly as hoped, the company’s strategy to hike prices is backfiring and leaving it with unsold stock and the discounting needed to shift that inventory only tarnishes Burberry’s credentials as a luxury brand, where lofty pricing is one of the attractions to plutocratic would-be purchasers,” AJ Bell's Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth, said.\n\nThe company’s struggles were laid bare further in September, when it was removed from the FTSE 100 ( ^FTSE ) in the quarterly reshuffle.\n\nBurberry has remained tight-lipped since its profit warning in July, the latest in a series of dire updates that prompted the luxury brand to halt dividend payments and announce the abrupt departure of its CEO, Jonathan Akeroyd.\n\nHere's more on what to look out for:\n\nIn big pharma, AstraZeneca will talk to investors after having its head of China operations detained, a crucial market for the company.\n\nShareholders in Disney will see if CEO Bob Iger still has a midas touch and in Asia, Alibaba is expected to deliver yet another quarterly growth.\n\nFrom luxury to utilities, markets are waiting to see how SSE can maintain its generous dividend policy amid further sector scrutiny and net zero goals.\n\nIn London, Burberry will let investors gauge on how the luxury market is performing, particularly as demand in China for exclusive items appears to be waning.\n\nEarnings releases are almost over but there are still a number of major companies across different sectors due to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBurberry's woes are particularly acute in key markets like Asia and the Americas, where sales have been hit by sluggish demand in China, Hong Kong, and the US. Comparable sales in Asia Pacific fell by 23% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025, while the Americas saw a 23% drop as well.\n\nFor the full fiscal year, analysts are forecasting a 19% fall in total sales, with a rebound expected in the second half. However, the company's profits are still expected to be under pressure. Burberry is projected to report an adjusted operating loss of £45m for the first half, a sharp contrast to the £223m profit achieved in the same period last year.\n\n“For the full year, the consensus forecast is looking for a modest operating profit of £30m, again to suggest better performance in the second half. All of this leaves the company a long way from the 20% profit margin target laid down by Akeroyd and it will be interesting to see if Schulman and colleagues reference that at all,” Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth, said.\n\nSSE (SSE.L) – Reports first-half results on Wednesday 13 November\n\nSSE is set to report its first-half results on Wednesday and the timing of this update is particularly significant for several reasons, according to AJ Bell.\n\nFirstly, utilities — a sector long in the crosshairs of both regulators and the public — have largely avoided the windfall taxes that have affected other industries. In the UK’s first budget under the new government, utilities were spared any new levies, a development that could impact both investor sentiment and long-term strategic planning within the sector.\n\nSecondly, the sector remains under intense public and regulatory scrutiny. Consumers continue to feel the pressure from rising energy bills, exacerbated by inflation, while utility companies are expected to ramp up their environmental and investment commitments\n\nThirdly, Ofwat’s AMP8 regulatory determination for water companies is due in December, with potential ramifications for utilities across the board, including SSE, which is involved in energy distribution and could see its operational models affected by broader regulatory changes in the sector.\n\nLastly, interest rate cuts from the Bank of England, could make the dividend yields from utility stocks like SSE more attractive relative to cash, potentially boosting demand for shares in the sector, which traditionally offers stable returns.\n\n“SSE’s shares are up by just under 10% in the past year and not far from their all-time highs. The company is a broad-ranging power play, as it generates electricity from gas-fired power stations, on and offshore wind farms and hydroelectric plants, and it also provides and runs electricity transmission and distribution networks,” Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth, said.\n\nFor SSE’s upcoming first-half results, two figures will likely grip the attention of investors, according to AJ Bell:\n\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS): SSE has set a target of 13% to 16% compound annual growth between 2022 and 2027, with EPS expected to grow from 158.5p in the year to March 2024 to between 175p and 200p by 2027. However, analysts are forecasting a more modest growth rate for this year, with the benchmark for the first-half result being last year’s adjusted EPS of 37p. Dividend: SSE reduced its dividend in 2024 to 60p per share to fund its renewable energy transition. Looking ahead, the company plans to increase the dividend by 5% to 10% annually through 2027, with the first-half dividend payment last year standing at 20p. Investors will be keen to see whether the company can maintain its dividend growth trajectory while continuing to invest in its Net Zero ambitions.\n\nWalt Disney Company (DIS) – reports quarterly results on Thursday 14 November\n\nThe Walt Disney Company is a trailblazer in global entertainment, with operations that span across animation, film, television, merchandise, and theme parks. Yet, despite its portfolio, the stock is trading almost 50% below its 2021 peak of $191 per share.\n\nWhile the return of Bob Iger as CEO has helped to steady the ship, investors are increasingly focused on the company’s future performance and long-term strategy. With Disney navigating shifts in the media landscape, the upcoming quarterly earnings report will offer crucial insights into the company’s trajectory and whether it can regain momentum.\n\nDespite the broader challenges facing Disney, analysts are optimistic about its earnings growth. The consensus expectation is for Walt Disney to report a year-over-year increase in earnings, driven by higher revenues. According to Zacks Equity Research, Disney is projected to post quarterly earnings of $1.09 per share, reflecting an impressive 32.9% increase from the same period last year.\n\nRevenues are also expected to see growth, with analysts forecasting $22.6bn in sales, marking a 6.4% year-over-year rise. If the company meets or exceeds these projections, it could provide a significant boost to investor confidence.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Disney exceeded expectations by reporting earnings of $1.39 per share, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.20 per share by 15.83%.\n\nWhile Disney’s parks business remains a key pillar of the company’s overall performance, chief financial officer Hugh Johnston tempered expectations for the upcoming quarter. Speaking at the company’s Q3 earnings call, Johnston noted that Disney is likely to see a flattish revenue number from its parks segment in Q4, due to a slowdown in consumer spending.\n\nJohnston said, however, that the parks slowdown would be “more than offset” by the company’s growing Entertainment business, which is expected to benefit from the release of highly anticipated films such as Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Disney has consistently outperformed analysts’ earnings estimates, delivering a surprise in each period.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) — Reports quarterly results Friday 15 November\n\nAlibaba Group is set to report earnings soon after China is expected to approve what could be its largest fiscal stimulus package since the pandemic—potentially providing a significant tailwind for the e-commerce giant.\n\nThe move is part of broader efforts by the government to reignite economic growth, and analysts believe that Alibaba, with its digital ecosystem spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, logistics, and digital entertainment, is well-positioned to benefit from any measures unveiled by the Chinese authorities.\n\nThis week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in Beijing is expected to finalise the details of the stimulus package, which will likely focus on enhancing domestic demand and providing support for key sectors such as technology, retail, and infrastructure. According to analysts, Alibaba, alongside its peers, stands to gain from both direct fiscal measures and the broader positive impact on consumer confidence and spending.\n\nDespite a challenging macroeconomic environment, Alibaba has continued to deliver quarterly revenue growth, with Bloomberg Intelligence expecting more of the same in its upcoming earnings report. The company’s performance has been bolstered by an improving regulatory landscape, which has eased some of the pressures it faced in recent years. This has led to increased investor optimism, particularly as Alibaba has taken steps to streamline its operations and reduce regulatory risks under the leadership of CEO Daniel Zhang.\n\nFor Alibaba, the upcoming Singles’ Day, China’s largest annual shopping festival held on November 11, presents another opportunity as the company is likely to offer steeper discounts and other promotions to stimulate demand. These efforts are expected to be further supported by broader government initiatives, such as China’s trade-in program aimed at boosting sales of consumer goods and home appliances.\n\nIn past years, Singles’ Day has been a critical period for Alibaba, with the company generating record sales on the back of massive online shopping events.\n\nAstrazeneca (AZN.L) - Reports quarterly results on Tuesday 12 November\n\nAstraZeneca faces pressure amid disappointing trial results and an investigation in China ahead of its earnings release.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company has been hit by a series of setbacks, including disappointing late-stage clinical trial results for its antibody cancer treatment Dato-DXd and the arrest of Leon Wang, president of its Chinese operations.\n\nChina is a major market for AstraZeneca, contributing nearly $6bn in revenue in 2023. The company is the largest foreign pharmaceutical firm operating in the country, and any disruption in its Chinese operations could have significant financial implications.\n\nShares in AstraZeneca have dropped about 16% over the past two months, following a record high at the end of August.\n\nDespite the challenges, AstraZeneca’s underlying business continues to show strong performance. For the first half of 2024, the company reported revenue growth of 18%, reaching $25.6bn, while core earnings per share (EPS) rose by 5% to $4.03.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 11 November\n\nCroda (CRDA.L)\n\nDirect Line (DLG.L)\n\nContinental (CON.DE)\n\nTuesday 12 November\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nDCC (DCC.L)\n\n3i Infrastructure (3IN.L)\n\nFlutter Entertainment (FLTR.L)\n\nOxford Instruments (OXIG.L)\n\nInfineon (IFNNY)\n\nBayer (BAYN.DE)\n\nUnited Internet (UTDI.DE)\n\nShopify (SHOP)\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY)\n\nLive Nation (LYV)\n\nTyson Foods (TSN)\n\nGrab (GRAB)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nMosaic (02M.F)\n\nIngram Micro (INGM)\n\nWednesday 13 November\n\nExperian (EXPN.L)\n\nIntermediate Capital (ICG.L)\n\nBabcock (BAB.L)\n\nFuller Smith & Turner (FSTA.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nSecure Trust Bank (STB.L)\n\nRakuten (5838.T)\n\nTencent Holdings (0700.HK)\n\nJD.com (JD)\n\nSingapore Telecom (SGAPY)\n\nSiemens Energy (0SEA.L)\n\nRWE (RWE.DE)\n\nABN Amro (ABN.AS)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nTelecom Italia (TIT.MI)\n\nNu (NU)\n\nThursday 14 November\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nB&M European Value Retail (BME.L)\n\nQinetiQ (QQ.L)\n\nGreat Portland Estates (GPE.L)\n\nFirstGroup (FGP.L)\n\nPremier Foods (PFD.L)\n\nAssura (AGR.L)\n\nAviva (AV.L)\n\nSpirax Group (SPX.L)\n\nKier (KIE.L)\n\nDentsu (4812.T)\n\nHon Hai Precision (HNHPF)\n\nGeeley (GELYY)\n\nLenovo (LNVGY)\n\nSiemens (SMMNY)\n\nDeutsche Telekom (DTEGY)\n\nMerck (MRK)\n\nE.On (EONGY)\n\nHapag-Lloyd (HLAGF)\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT)\n\nMacy’s (M)\n\nFriday 15 November\n\nLand Securities (LAND.L)\n\nVolex (VLX.L)\n\nRecord (REC.L)\n\nGenerali (BGN.MI)\n\nAegon (AEG)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nFoot Locker (FL)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:44:48.068049+00:00"}

But that doesn't mean long term investors can avoid big losses. To wit, the Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:BAYN) share price managed to fall 64% over five long years. That's not a lot of fun for true believers. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 40% in the last year. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 16% in thirty days.\n\nNow let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Bayer\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Bayer moved from a loss to profitability. On the other hand, it reported a trailing twelve months loss, suggesting it isn't reliably profitable. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.\n\nWe don't think that the 0.4% is big factor in the share price, since it's quite small, as dividends go. In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 3.3% a year in the five year period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity.\n\nThe company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\n\nXTRA:BAYN Earnings and Revenue Growth November 3rd 2024\n\nBayer is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. If you are thinking of buying or selling Bayer stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Bayer's TSR for the last 5 years was -58%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:44:50.111893+00:00"}

Net income totaled $26.25bn, compared with a loss of $12.77bn a year earlier.\n\nBerkshire's cash pile grew to $325bn, up from a record $272bn (£208bn) at the end of June.\n\nShares in Berkshire Hathaway are up 26% year-to-date, beating the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) 20% rise in that time.\n\nBerkshire has now sold more than 600 million of the iPhone maker's shares in 2024, though it still held $69.9bn of Apple shares — its largest stock holding.\n\nIn its quarterly report on Saturday, Berkshire said it sold about 100 million, or 25%, of its Apple shares over the last few months, taking its total to about 300 million.\n\nHere's more on what to look out for:\n\nAnother major UK company scheduled to report is Marks & Spencer ( MA6.SG ), with investors looking out for more progress on its \"reshaping\" strategy.\n\nHousebuilder Vistry ( VTY.L ) is also due to release a trading update, which comes after it warned on profits last month.\n\nInvestors will be looking to see how pharmaceuticals firm Novo Nordisk ( NVO ) is performing, as it faces growing competition in the weight-loss drug space.\n\nServer maker Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) will also be in focus, as it releases quarterly results, amid auditory scrutiny around the company.\n\nInvestors will be looking to the latest report from Warren Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK-B ), to garner any insights on markets from the \"oracle of Omaha\".\n\nThe US presidential election and the latest interest rate decisions from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are likely to dominate market focus in the coming week, but there are also a number of major companies still due to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nUS indices, including the main S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq (^IXIC), have been trading near all-time highs. However, earnings releases from Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) sparked concern among investors about growing AI costs and the prospects for Big Tech more broadly, which weighed on markets.\n\nIn the coming week, the focus for markets is set to shift to the US presidential election on Tuesday and the US Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision on Thursday.\n\nA statement from Berkshire Hathaway last week clarified Buffett's public stance ahead of the election, saying that he \"does not currently and will not prospectively endorse investment products or endorse and support political candidates\".\n\nIn terms of Berkshire Hathaway's company performance, total revenue grew to $93.7bn in the second quarter, up from $92.5bn for the same period last year. However, net earnings fell to $30.5bn, from $36.2bn in Q2 2023. One of the major pieces of news to come from the results, was that Berkshire Hathaway had cuts its holdings in Apple (AAPL) by nearly 50%.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) — Reports first-quarter results on Tuesday 5 November\n\nShares in Super Micro Computer plunged after it was revealed that Ernst & Young (EY) had resigned as the server maker's auditor.\n\nIn a resignation letter, EY said: “We are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”\n\nSuper Micro said in a filing that it \"disagrees\" with EY's decision and is \"working diligently to select new auditors\".\n\nRead more: What the budget means for UK interest rates\n\nThis latest news comes after short seller firm Hindenburg Research released a report in August, in which \"accounting manipulation\" at Super Micro.\n\nThe US Department of Justice then reportedly launched an investigation into the firm.\n\nShares also fell sharply after Super Micro released fourth quarter results in August that missed both on profit and revenue expectations. Revenue came in at $5.31bn, slightly below estimates of $5.32bn. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $6.25, fell short of the $8.25 analysts had anticipated.\n\nLooking ahead to the first quarter, Super Micro said expected to report net sales of $6bn to $7bn and net income per diluted share of $5.97 to $7.66.\n\nFor the 2025 fiscal year, the company said it expects to post net sale of $26bn to $30bn.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NOVO-B.CO) — Reports third-quarter results on Wednesday 6 November\n\nThe maker of popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk is facing rising competition in this space.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) has said that it plans to advertise its drug, Zepbound, for the first time next month.\n\nNovo Nordisk, once Europe's most valuable company, missed second quarter revenue estimates, which came in at $3.8bn versus forecasts of $4.1bn.\n\nThe company's sales of Wegovy came in weaker than expected, at 21bn Danish krone (£2.4bn).\n\nRead more: Gold surges on Diwali day after biggest buying spree of the year\n\nNovo Nordisk lowered its operating profit outlook growth for the year to between 20% and 28%, from a previous forecast of 22% to 30%.

Individuals who have hot flashes from taking adjuvant endocrine therapy are also included in elinzanetant’s span, as per a 15 October press release.\n\nThe submission to the EMA comes a week after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted a new drug application (NDA) from the German drugmaker for elinzanetant in the same indication, minus endocrine therapy inclusion. Bayer has also submitted to regulatory agencies in Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK.\n\nHot flashes, also called hot flushes, result from decreased levels of oestrogen affecting neurons in the hypothalamus. These cells, KNDy neurons, hyperactivate the thermoregulatory pathway, causing a sudden feeling of intense warmth in the body. Up to 80% of women undergoing menopausal transition experience vasomotor symptoms, with a third of women reporting severe symptoms.\n\nCurrently, the standard approach to combat hot flashes is by taking oestrogen, but long-term hormone therapy carries risks. Elinzanetant works by non-hormonal action, modulating the KNDy neurons in the hypothalamus by dual neurokinin-1 and 3 (NK-1 and 3) receptor antagonist activity. The therapy was added to Bayer’s portfolio as part of the acquisition of UK-based KaNDy Therapeutics in 2020.\n\nElinzanetant has demonstrated efficacy and long-term safety in treating moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in the four-study Phase III OASIS programme.

The OASIS 4 study is an ongoing expansion of the Phase III programme evaluating elinzanetant in women experiencing hot flashes due to endocrine therapy for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer.\n\nBayer executive vice president of global product strategy and commercialisation said: “Menopausal symptoms can differ significantly from one woman to another in both their nature and intensity. With this submission, Bayer is seeking to expand treatment choices so that clinicians can offer more personalized care that addresses the unique needs of each woman.”\n\nIf approved, elinzanetant will compete with Astellas’ Veozah (fezolinetant), an NK-3 receptor agonist, which was approved in Europe in December 2023.

Pharma companies are constantly striving to ramp up innovation and spend a significantly high portion of their revenues on R&D. Successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas, and strong clinical study results may act as important catalysts for these stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that developmulti-million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health products, medical devices and consumer-related healthcare products.These players invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already-marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies, and these large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions and collaboration deals are other key features of large drug companies.\n\nHowever, regular pipeline setbacks, slow ramp-up of newer drugs, supply chain disruptions, uncertainty about the impact of Medicare drug price negotiations, Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) scrutiny of M&A deals and macroeconomic uncertainty ahead of the U.S. presidential elections are some of the headwinds for the sector. Despite these headwinds, there has been a surge in investments in drug/biotech stocks this year, marking a turnaround from last year.\n\nLarge drugmakers have several robust revenue streams and are mostly profitable companies, which makes them safe havens for investments. Innovation is key to the growth of the industry. Innovation in the industry is at its peak, with spaces like weight loss/obesity, inflammation and Alzheimer’s disease attracting investor interest. M&A activity also remains strong.\n\nThe drug and biotech industry has done well this year, driven by increased mergers and acquisitions (M&A), the launch of promising new medicines and pipeline successes. Obesity drugs of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have witnessed tremendous success, which has played a key role in the industry’s outperformance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAggressive M&A & Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&A activity. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies, sitting on huge piles of cash, regularly buy innovative small/mid-cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.\n\nAlso, sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices and the emergence of big tech firms like Apple and Google in the healthcare industry whet the M&A appetite of large drugmakers.Also, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing.\n\nFast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&A activities. Of late, areas like obesity and inflammatory bowel disease are attracting buyout interest. There has been a slew of M&A announcements in 2024. Some of the larger ones are Eli Lilly’s buyout of Morphic, Vertex’s buyout of Alpine Immune Sciences and Novo Nordisk’s offer to buy Catalent.\n\nPipeline Setbacks & Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments, the slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs, Medicare drug price negotiations and increasing FTC scrutiny of M&A deals.\n\nMacroeconomic Uncertainty: Escalating geopolitical tensions (the Russia-Ukraine and Gaza-Israel conflicts) and their impact on global economic growth and macroeconomic uncertainty ahead of the U.S. presidential elections have increased broader economic woes\n\nThe recent dockworkers' strike at U.S. ports and its potential adverse impact on global supply chains is also a near-term concern.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bright Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industryis a 12-stock group within the broader Medical sector. The group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #47, which places it in the top 19% of 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBefore we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let’s take a look at the industry’s performance and its current valuation.\n\nIndustry Versus S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe industry has outperformed the Zacks Medical Sector but slightly underperformed the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nStocks in this industry have collectively risen 18.6% year to date compared with the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s increase of 20.7% and the Zacks Medical Sector’s increase of 6.4% in the said time frame.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 18.82X compared with the S&P 500’s 21.71X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 22.59X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 20.69X, as low as 13.31X and at a median of 15.18X.\n\n5 Large Drugmakers to Watch\n\nEli Lilly: It has consistently reported strong revenues and profits and dealt well with expiring patents and increasing competition. The stupendous success of GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro (diabetes) and Zepbound (obesity), has made it the largest drugmaker with a market cap of more than $840 billion.\n\nMounjaro and Zepbound have become key top-line drivers despite a short time on the market. Both include the same compound tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP-1 RA), a category gaining tremendous popularity. Tirzepatide is also being developed for other indications, approvals for which can further boost sales.\n\nIn the past couple of years, Lilly has also received approvals for several new drugs like Kisunla, Omvoh and Jaypirca and witnessed pipeline and regulatory success. Its new drugs have been contributing significantly to its top-line growth in 2024. Incremental contribution for new drugs, rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s and regular M&A activity are key reasons to invest in the stock.\n\nEli Lilly has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) currently. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lilly’s 2024 EPS has risen from $13.79 to $16.49 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has risen 52.2% year to date.\n\nAstraZeneca: It boasts a diversified geographical footprint as well as a product portfolio with several blockbuster medicines. AstraZeneca now has 12 blockbuster medicines in its portfolio, with sales exceeding $1 billion, including Tagrisso, Fasenra, Farxiga, Imfinzi, Lynparza, Soliris and Ultomiris. These drugs are driving the company’s top line with AstraZeneca launching them in more markets and an increased number of indications.\n\nAstraZeneca has been making significant progress with its pipeline in areas like oncology, cardiovascular health, immunology and rare diseases. This year, it has acquired small biotechs like Gracell, Fusion Pharmaceuticals and Amolyt to strengthen its pipeline.\n\nBacked by its new products and pipeline drugs, AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period. AstraZeneca expects to generate $80 billion in total revenues by 2030. By the said time frame, AstraZeneca plans to launch 20 new medicines. It believes that many of these new medicines will have the potential to generate more than $5 billion in peak-year revenues. The company is also on target to achieve a mid-30s percentage core operating margin by 2026.\n\nAstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AstraZeneca’s 2024 EPS has risen from $4.04 per share to $4.08 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has risen 15.0% so far this year.\n\nBayer: The company’s key drugs, Nubeqa for cancer and Kerendia for the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type II diabetes, are fueling growth in its Pharmaceuticals division. The company is also working to expand the labels of Nubeqa and Kerendia, which, if successful, can further drive growth. Bayer also plans to launch two new drugs, elinzanetant and acoramidis, in 2025.\n\nSales in the Crop Science division declined significantly in 2023 due to lower volumes and prices for glyphosate-based products. However, sales in the segment improved slightly in the second quarter of 2024 amid headwinds in a challenging agricultural market environment. Consumer Health returned to growth.\n\nThis Zacks #2 Ranked stock has declined 10.9% so far this year. Estimates for its 2024 earnings per share have increased from $1.35 to $1.38 over the past 60 days.\n\nSanofi: Its immunology drug Dupixent has become a key top-line driver on strong demand trends.Dupixent is now annualizing at close to €11.0 billion in sales after almost eight years on the market. Sanofi expects Dupixent to achieve more than €13 billion in sales in 2024 and a low double-digit CAGR till 2030. Sanofi possesses one of the world’s leading vaccine operations, with total annual sales of more than €5 billion in the past five years. Sanofi expects annual net sales to be more than €10 billion from its Vaccines unit by 2030, backed by its innovation efforts.\n\nIt has launched several new drugs in the past couple of years and accelerated its mid- and late-stage pipeline this year. It has also been active on the M&A front.\n\nIn July, Sanofi improved its earnings growth expectations for 2024 from a decline in the low single-digit range to stable on a constant currency rate basis. The increase in guidance was based on a strong performance in the first half and an optimistic outlook for the second half of the year.\n\nSanofi has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nEstimates for its 2024 earnings per share have risen from $4.21 per share to $4.26 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has surged 11.5% year to date.\n\nPfizer: It is one of the largest and most successful drugmakers in the field of oncology. Its position in oncology was strengthened with the addition of Seagen in December last year. After a couple of tough years, it seems that Pfizer’s worst slowdown is over now, and the company is gradually making a comeback. Though Pfizer’s COVID revenues are declining, its non-COVID drugs and potential contributions from new and newly acquired products have started to drive growth.\n\nPfizer’s non-COVID operational revenues improved in the first half of 2024, driven by its key in-line products like Prevnar, Vyndaqel and Eliquis, new launches like Abrysvo, Velsipity, Penbraya, newly acquired products like Nurtec as well as those acquired from Seagen (December 2023). The trend is expected to continue in the second half.\n\nPfizer’s new products/late-stage pipeline candidates, coupled with newly acquired products, including those acquired from Seagen, position it strongly for operational growth in 2025 and beyond. Huge profits from its COVID products strengthened its cash position. The funds are being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt.\n\nPfizer is a #3 Ranked stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 EPS has risen from $2.59 to $2.62 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has declined 0.7% so far this year.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Assessments were repeated at 18 months with final assessments at 24 months.\n\nThe safety profile of bemdaneprocel at 24 months is consistent with the earlier observed findings. Data demonstrated that bemdaneprocel continues to be well-tolerated by patients, with no adverse events reported related to bemdaneprocel.\n\nResults showed that even after discontinuing immunosuppression therapy at 12 months, as outlined in the study’s protocol, transplanted cells continue to survive and engraft in the brain.\n\nSecondary clinical endpoints related to motor symptoms also continue to show positive trends from baseline through the duration of follow-up. Notably, there are more encouraging trends in the high-dose cohort than those in the low-dose cohort.\n\nThese were assessed by the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Part II and III (MDS-UPDRS Part II & III) and the Hauser PD Diary tools used to assess Parkinson’s disease severity in motor symptoms.\n\nA mean reduction of 21.9 months as compared with baseline was observed in the high-dose cohort on the 24-month measurement of the effects of bemdaneprocel on motor symptoms using MDS-UPDRS Part III measured in the “OFF”-medication state.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Bayer basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Bayer imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Though the verdict was reduced to $2.1 billion by an appeals court in June 2020, it still rejected J&J’s appeal to overturn the 2018 jury verdict.

Farmers have for decades grown genetically modified soybeans and corn, mostly used for livestock feed or biofuels. But direct consumption of GMO crops by humans has long stoked fierce opposition from consumer and environmental groups.\n\nThe company reached a milestone last month as the US, a top-five wheat exporter, gave the green light to HB4, which tolerates drought as well as glufosinate herbicide. But Trucco sought to temper expectations about how quickly investors will see HB4 harvests in the Midwest, explaining in an interview that it may take up to three years to adapt genetics and breed enough seeds to sell to farmers.\n\n“Fully monetizing the opportunity will take us a few years,” he said. “But I think there’s a more immediate effect in terms of increasing the level of credibility. It’s a more demanding market saying: ‘We want the technology.’”\n\nIn Argentina, where roll-out of HB4 wheat is most advanced, Bioceres still has hurdles to surpass.\n\nTrying to expand acreage outside of closely controlled identity-preserved planting will entail “a more patient approach to growth,” Trucco told analysts.\n\nThe push with seed breeders and farmers needs fine-tuning, Trucco said, citing ongoing industry doubts over GMO wheat and high royalty charges for HB4. “We underestimated the level of validation that is required for conventional sales,” he said.\n\nStill, about 20 flour mills in Argentina are already buying HB4 and hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland have been sown with the strain this season in a country with a total wheat area of about 6 million hectares (14.8 million acres), Trucco said in the interview.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:45:25.485506+00:00"}
