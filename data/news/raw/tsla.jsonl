Until we get more clarity, here‚Äôs where things stand:\n\nEarnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve ‚Äî having resolved the inflation crisis ‚Äî shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nBut growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.\n\nActions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor‚Äôs perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nStocks are not the economy: There‚Äôs a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth ‚Äî in the cooling economy ‚Äî is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nMind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nInvesting is never a smooth ride: There‚Äôs also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nThink long-term: For now, there‚Äôs no reason to believe there‚Äôll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won‚Äôt be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it‚Äôs a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:35:34.987451+00:00"}

However, shares in machine vision expert Cognex (CGNX -1.01%), advanced materials company Hexcel (HXL -1.03%), and Tesla (TSLA 2.28%) all declined in the first half of 2025. On balance, all three are worth buying, as their issues appear to be near term, and their long-term investment cases remain excellent.\n\nCognex's machine vision\n\nIt's been a difficult few years for the leading machine vision company, as its main end markets suffered cyclical weakness. Let's put it this way: If you are an automotive company, consumer electronics, or logistics company, and seeing slowing end markets due to relatively high interest rates, then the first thing you will cut is capital spending on new product development and expanding production lines.\n\nThat's what happened with Cognex over the last couple of years, and it's easily seen in a chart of its revenue over an extended period.\n\nAnother thing you might notice is that, although Cognex's revenue does oscillate wildly, it does so about an upward trend line, and I think there's every reason to believe Cognex could get back to an aggressive growth phase in the near future.\n\nIt's not only that machine vision is an integral part of the fourth industrial revolution (the integration of the digital and physical worlds using the Internet of Things, and advanced data analytics), but it's also a technology whose relevance will increase with the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning.\n\nInstead of rules-based machine vision (such as monitoring a product assembly line for a known defect), AI-infused machine vision can learn from masses of data and examples fed into it, and even learn to recognize defects that product engineers didn't previously understand.\n\nWith the underlying growth in the adoption of machine vision (with AI as an additional driver) and a return to cyclical growth in its key end markets (automakers and consumer electronics can't avoid developing new products forever), Cognex is positioned to achieve management's aim of 10% to 11% annual organic growth through the cycle.\n\nHexcel's near-term challenges and long-term opportunities\n\nSelling advanced graphite composite materials to Boeing, Airbus, and their subcontractors presents a promising business opportunity, considering both companies' substantial backlogs of aircraft slated for delivery over the next decade (8,754 for Airbus, and over 5,900 for Boeing).\n\nIn addition, Hexcel also supplies materials for the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) market (it's partnering with Archer Aviation), also sells to Embraer, and as CEO Tom Gentile noted on the recent earnings call, \"the modern large cabin business jets now have extensive composite content, with ship set value between $200,000 and $500,000 per shipset.\"\n\nUnderpinning all of this is the positive trend in usage of composite materials, which increases with every new generation of aircraft, notably on wide-bodies such as the Airbus A350, which has a shipset of value of $4.5 million to $5 million for Hexcel.\n\nThe long-term outlook is excellent, but in the near term, Hexcel catches a cold when Airbus and Boeing start sneezing over supply chain issues that lower their production ramps.\n\nStill, it's undoubtedly a question of when, not if, the commercial aircraft production ramp gets back on track, and there are already some very positive signs that supply chain issues with engines are being overcome. As such, investing in Hexcel could set you up for life.\n\nDon't count out Tesla\n\nTesla's electric vehicle (EV) sales have declined this year, and CEO Elon Musk openly acknowledges the company could face a few rough quarters, not least due to the removal of EV tax credits. A combination of rivals releasing EVs and trying to establish market share, and ongoing relatively high interest rates, has pressured sales of Tesla's Model Y in particular.\n\nAt the same time, and on a more positive note, Tesla has begun its robotaxi rollout, and the key to the investment case for the stock is the potential growth in its robotaxi and unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) businesses. As previously discussed, it's not just the massive potential in the robotaxi business in itself; a successful rollout and the future release of unsupervised FSD to the public will add significant value to Tesla's EVs.\n\nAll the major automakers have either invested heavily in or explored robotaxis, and the reality is that Tesla remains best placed to succeed, provided it gets widespread regulatory approval. No other automaker has anything close to its market share in EVs in the U.S. It's far from clear when, and if ever, rivals like Alphabet's Waymo will be profitable, and Tesla's fleet of vehicles continues to rack up vast amounts of data to help improve its FSD.\n\nAs the rollout expands, and Tesla potentially deals with its flagging Model Y sales by releasing an affordable Model Y as planned in the fourth quarter, its stock price can appreciate through 2025. However, be aware that any significant issue with the rollout is likely to hurt the stock. Tesla is risky, but the risk comes with a potential reward in this case.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:35:37.870801+00:00"}

Each year, the firm releases a new edition of its \"Big Ideas\" report, and the 2025 version outlines how autonomous vehicles could turn ride-hailing into a $10 trillion industry over the long term. Ark predicts these cars will dramatically reduce the cost per mile of transportation, leading to widespread adoption around the world.\n\nTesla (TSLA 2.28%) is one of the leading developers of self-driving cars, and it recently launched an autonomous (but supervised) ride-hailing service in the U.S. as a test run for its upcoming Cybercab robotaxi. However, Tesla might not be the biggest winner of the autonomous revolution in the long run.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER -3.30%) operates the world's largest ride-hailing network, and it has all of the infrastructure in place to accommodate the shift toward self-driving vehicles. In fact, some of the biggest developers are choosing Uber's platform to commercialize their autonomous technologies.\n\nUber stock trades at a far more attractive valuation than Tesla stock right now, so here's why it could be a great buy as the self-driving revolution gathers steam.\n\nUber's network is unrivaled\n\nDeveloping the world's best autonomous vehicle isn't Tesla's biggest challenge. Building a ride-hailing network and successfully scaling it so consumers feel confident they can catch a ride anywhere, anytime is the hard part, especially since many other carmakers are likely to enter this race over the long term.\n\nUber has an incredible advantage in that department, because 180 million people use its platform every month for ride-hailing, food delivery, and commercial freight services. Therefore, even though Uber doesn't manufacture autonomous vehicles, it's quickly becoming the go-to destination for companies that do, because they want to access as many potential customers as possible.\n\nCEO Dara Khosrowshahi says Uber is already equipped with the necessary infrastructure to help companies deploy their autonomous vehicles, thanks to its 15 years of experience managing utilization in so many different cities. If a company deploys too many vehicles in a given location, Khosrowshahi says up to 95% of them could sit idle during quiet periods. If they don't deploy enough vehicles, they can't provide the timely service customers expect from ride-hailing platforms like Uber.\n\nThat is a huge challenge for newcomers like Tesla. Plus, Uber has processes in place to quickly handle fare disputes, insurance claims, and lost item returns (when customers accidentally leave valuables behind), which are small but highly necessary services.\n\nUber's list of autonomous partnerships continues to expand\n\nAutonomous driving could transform Uber's business from a financial perspective. During the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), its 8.8 million active drivers earned a combined $20.8 billion, which was the largest component of its $46.7 billion in gross bookings (the dollar amount customers spent on the platform). If Uber can eliminate that cost, a much larger chunk of its bookings will become revenue and profit.\n\nUber had partnerships with 20 different developers of autonomous vehicles at the end of Q2, which was up from 18 in the first quarter. One of those partners is Alphabet's Waymo, which is already completing over 250,000 paid autonomous trips every week in the U.S. through a combination of its own ride-hailing platform and Uber's.\n\nUber also welcomed China-based Baidu as a new partner in Q2. Its Apollo Go robotaxi service has completed over 11 million autonomous trips in total across Asia and the Middle East, which will supercharge Uber's presence in these high-growth markets.\n\nBy comparison, Tesla is way behind in the autonomous ride-hailing business. Its full self-driving software isn't approved for unsupervised use anywhere in the world right now, so the company still hasn't cleared the most basic hurdle. The autonomous ride-hailing service it launched in June uses passenger electric vehicles (EVs) like the Model Y and it requires full supervision, which means a human specialist is in the passenger seat at all times in case something goes wrong.\n\nUber stock looks far more attractive than Tesla stock\n\nUber stock might be a better investment than Tesla stock, not only because the company is in a more favorable position to capture the $10 trillion autonomous ride-hailing opportunity, but also because of its valuation.\n\nBased on Uber's trailing-12-month revenue of $47.3 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.2, making it far cheaper than Tesla stock, which trades at a P/S ratio of 12.4:\n\nUber's profits are also growing significantly, while Tesla's are currently shrinking due to several consecutive quarters of struggling EV sales.

The cohort consists of:\n\nNvidia NVDA 1.05% ) Microsoft MSFT 0.22% ) Apple AAPL 4.24% ) Amazon AMZN -0.23% ) Alphabet GOOG 2.44% ) GOOGL 2.48% ) Meta Platforms META 0.92% ) Tesla TSLA 2.28% )\n\nAll of these companies (except for Nvidia) have reported results, and investors may be curious as to which ones look like solid buys. I think all of these stocks are growing more interesting each day, but of the seven, I think five are a buy and two are to be watched.\n\nI'm keeping an eye on Apple and Tesla\n\nOver the past few years, many of these companies have delivered explosive revenue growth, except for Apple. Apple's growth finally returned in Q3 FY 2025, delivering double-digit growth (if you round up) for the first time since early 2022.\n\nStill, there are some questions about being behind in the AI arms race and what Apple's next big product is. I'm not ready to declare Apple a buy yet, but it's growing more intriguing with each quarter.\n\nTesla is in the worst shape of any Magnificent Seven company, with revenue falling 16% year over year in Q2. Additionally, with EV and regulatory credits getting eliminated, significant headwinds are popping up. However, Tesla's business has never been solely about EVs; otherwise, its valuation wouldn't make sense. An investment in Tesla is a bet that its humanoid robots, AI, self-driving, and rob-taxis will all be successes eventually. But for right now, I'm comfortable waiting on Tesla's situation to improve.\n\nI'm a buyer of the remaining five\n\nThe other five members of the Magnificent Seven all look promising to me, as they're all experiencing strong growth.\n\nMeta Platforms delivered a shocking Q2 report that delivered 22% revenue growth despite only guiding for 13% growth. That strength is expected to continue through Q3, with 20% revenue growth expected.\n\nMeta's advertising business is second to none, and the improvements it's making with AI to aid in ad creation and engagement are starting to pay off.\n\nAlphabet similarly had a strong advertising quarter, despite many investors being worried about Google Search potentially being left behind by generative AI. Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year, showcasing its strength and silencing doubters about its longevity.\n\nCompanywide, Alphabet's revenue rose 14% year over year, with diluted earnings per share rising 22%. That's an impressive result from a company that is supposed to be struggling. Additionally, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading for 20 times forward earnings.\n\nAll of this combines to make Alphabet one of the best stocks to buy right now.\n\nDespite Microsoft being the second-largest company in the world, it delivered monster growth in Q4 FY 2025 (ended June 30). Revenue was up 18% year over year, but the biggest shock in its report was Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing product and is a leading platform for building AI models. Azure's revenue was up a jaw-dropping 39% this quarter, showcasing strong demand for computing power.\n\nThis tailwind will persist for some time, making Microsoft an excellent stock to scoop up now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN -0.23%) investors had a negative reaction to its report, which caused shares to sink following earnings. However, I don't think they were as bad as the market thought, and the long-term outlook is still positive for the company.\n\nAmazon's profit growth continues to outpace revenue growth thanks to the strength of high-margin businesses like advertising and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAs long as this trend continues, Amazon will be a strong long-term pick. With both advertising and AWS being Amazon's fastest-growing segments by far, this trend looks primed to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nLast is Nvidia, which hasn't reported earnings yet. However, all of the companies involved in building out AI infrastructure on this list stated that their capital expenditures will be rising next year due to increased data center spend. This bodes well for Nvidia, as it receives a huge chunk of this spend. Additionally, Nvidia has reapplied for its export license to begin shipping H20 chips to China again, which will provide another growth tailwind for its business.\n\nI expect Nvidia to report blowout earnings on Aug. 27, making the stock a smart stock to scoop up before then. Nvidia may be the world's largest company, but I expect it to get even bigger with increased AI buildout.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:35:47.502720+00:00"}

Many people are waiting for the new version, and it could help Tesla sell more cars. Also, Tesla is working hard on self-driving technology, and the planned robotaxi is expected to be a big step forward. If that project does well, it could open up a new area of business for Tesla. Wedbush also said that the current political climate under a Trump administration could make things easier for Tesla when it comes to rules and regulations.

Between the new cars, the robotaxi, and support from the government, the company could keep growing. With a stock price much lower than the $500 target, some investors may see this as a good opportunity.\n\nTesla is a battery technology company because it designs and manufactures advanced lithium-ion battery cells, energy storage products like Powerwall and Megapack, and integrates these technologies into its electric vehicles and energy grid solutions, driving innovation in sustainable energy storage and usage.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

While Ark's portfolio boasts positions in many members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" one particular artificial intelligence (AI) darling seems to have caught Wood's eye as of late.\n\nAccording to recently published trading activity, Ark Invest has been scooping up shares of Tesla (TSLA 2.28%) like there's no tomorrow.\n\nLet's explore Wood's recent buying activity and assess what might have inspired her to double down on Tesla over the last few weeks.\n\nTaking a look at Wood's recent buying activity\n\nUnlike many of her peers in the wealth management space, Wood distributes summaries at the end of each trading session which itemize all of the stocks that Ark bought and sold on that day.\n\nIn the table below, I've summarized Ark's recent activity around Tesla stock.\n\nDate Shares Bought July 11 59,705 July 15 115,380 July 24 143,190\n\nOver the last few weeks, Wood added 318,275 shares of Tesla which were spread across the Ark Innovation, Ark Next Generation Internet, and Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhy might Wood like Tesla stock right now?\n\nTesla is primarily known for its electric vehicles and energy storage solutions. But over the last few years, CEO Elon Musk has been making grand promises that Tesla is going to disrupt the AI realm in epic fashion.\n\nOne of the ways Tesla plans to make a splash in the AI landscape is through its innovations in autonomous driving. The company is introducing self-driving vehicles to the Tesla ecosystem by offering the technology as a service -- primarily within Tesla vehicles purchased by consumers, as well as through the creation of a robotaxi fleet.\n\nWood has been bullish on Tesla's AI pursuits for years, especially the robotaxi business. In fact, Ark's long-run price target of $2,600 per Tesla share relies heavily on optimistic assumptions surrounding the company's ability to scale the robotaxi operation.\n\nWhile Tesla's robotaxi business is still comparatively smaller than Alphabet's Waymo and faces increased competition from the likes of Uber Technologies and its various partnerships, Musk appears undeterred.\n\nDuring Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, Musk proclaimed, \"I think we will probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year.\"\n\nMusk's statement is equal parts bold and speculative -- attributes that are congruent with Wood's growth investing strategy. At the end of the day, I don't think Wood is privy to anything meaningful that the rest of Wall Street isn't, though.\n\nInvestors like Wood tend to view Tesla through a long-run lens. In other words, some growth investors are not pricing Tesla for what the company is today, but rather they are assessing what the price could become if Musk pulls off his AI vision. While I understand how tempting it can be to follow hype and momentum, valuing narratives is essentially impossible.\n\nI think that Wood is optimistic that the robotaxi business will scale meaningfully during the second half of 2025, finally bearing fruit for Tesla as the company shifts from a traditional automaker to a technology business.\n\nIs Tesla stock a buy right now?\n\nValuing Tesla stock is an arduous exercise. On the one hand, the company does not fit neatly into the traditional automaker category alongside companies such as Ford Motor Company and General Motors. But on the other hand, Tesla is not purely a technology business much like Apple, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, or Amazon. Rather, Tesla sits at the intersection of car manufacturing, energy storage, AI, robotics, and software.\n\nIn the chart above, investors can see how Tesla stock tends to trade on narratives well beyond traditional valuation fundamentals. These dynamics can be seen clearly by the company's expanding price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple despite decelerating profitability across the business.\n\nWhile I'm optimistic about Tesla's robotaxi business in the long run, I do question Musk's aggressive timeline of serving half the U.S. population by year end. Beyond variables such as regulatory approvals needed across the country, Musk does have a reputation for missing deadlines. Candidly, I don't think the robotaxi rollout will be any different.\n\nFor now, I'd monitor Tesla as it scales the robotaxi business. It will take time before AI begins to move the needle for the company from a financial perspective, anyway. For these reasons, I think investors will have ample opportunity -- and probably more reasonable valuation levels -- to buy Tesla stock in the long run.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:35:56.839009+00:00"}

Between allegations Tesla isn't paying its bills and hurting small businesses, to facing consumer backlash from CEO Elon Musk's political tour (and we can't forget the sliding sales and global profits), it's been a full downpour. Let's consider the recent speed bumps, as well as Musk being rewarded with a hefty $29 billion payday.\n\nThe overseas spiral\n\nJuly figures are seeping in from Europe, and they show that Tesla registrations checked in 41.6% lower compared to the prior year, despite sales of electric vehicles (EVs) surging across the Continent.\n\nIt's a continuation of the sales spiral the EV maker faced during the first half of 2025. And the problem is that the decline was supposedly due to the new Model Y being in limited supply -- but the issues appear to be deeper than that.\n\nThe story is similar in China, another crucial market for Tesla. Its sales of China-made EVs dropped 8.4% in July compared to the prior year. That was a reversal from the small gain Tesla posted in June, which at the time reversed an eight-month losing streak.\n\nThe consumer backlash\n\nThe consumer displeasure is real, and Musk's political allegiances have pushed some buyers to new and different brands. There's evidence of the effect this is having on Tesla's once-spotless brand image, according to new data from S&P Global Mobility, which tracks sales data across the automotive industry.\n\nThe new data, shared with Reuters, showed that Tesla's consumer loyalty took a nosedive in July 2024, correlating with Musk's public commitment to an anti-environmental political campaign. According to Reuters, Tesla's loyalty peaked at 73% in June 2024 before bottoming out in March at 49.9%. No matter how you slice it, that's a quick and dramatic decline in consumer sentiment, literally driving buyers to another brand.\n\nA massive payday\n\nTesla's board granted Musk 96 million shares, worth roughly $29 billion, in an attempt to keep the billionaire focused on the EV company amid his multiple businesses and ventures. The vote comes after a 2024 Delaware court ruling that voided Musk's 2018 compensation package, which was valued at over $50 billion. The court said the approval process was flawed and unfair to shareholders.\n\nAccording to Automotive News, the special committee that was formed to consider the new pay package said: \"While we recognize Elon's business ventures, interests and other potential demands on his time and attention are extensive and wide-ranging ... we are confident that this award will incentivize Elon to remain at Tesla.\"\n\nWhat it all means\n\nTesla and its investors certainly appear to be at a crossroads. While selling EVs and zero-emission credits keeps the lights on for the young company, it constantly reminds investors that its future may be more in line with artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and robotaxi services. Long-term investors should stay the course but should also prepare for a bumpy few quarters as the company works through its upcoming identity crisis, the slow ramp-up of the robotaxi, and an aging lineup.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:36:00.779920+00:00"}

However, the company has seemingly taken a step back in the past few years as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has boosted the value of many other big tech companies.\n\nIn the past three years, Apple's stock is only up around 30%, making it the second-worst performer of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks (trailing only Tesla) and underperforming the S&P 500. That's not something investors are used to seeing from Apple.\n\nDespite Apple seemingly lagging behind, there could possibly be a breath of fresh air coming to the company, sparking new life into the stock.\n\nA much-needed rebound for the iPhone and Mac products\n\nApple's fiscal third-quarter earnings, for the period ended June 28, were a pleasant surprise for many people. Its revenue grew nearly 10% year over year to $94 billion, which is a June quarter record for the iPhone maker. And speaking of iPhone, the smartphone's revenue grew 13% year over year to $44.6 billion, which Apple noted was driven by the popularity of the iPhone 16 family.\n\nMac (which includes products like MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, and Mac Studio) revenue grew 15% year over year to $8 billion, but iPad and wearables, home, and accessories sales were noticeably down -- 8% and 9% year over year, respectively.\n\nStill, Apple's hardware revenue grew by 8% year over year and accounted for nearly 71% of its total revenue for the quarter. Apple's services segment reached an all-time high, bringing in $27.4 billion, but hardware remains -- and will likely remain -- king for the company.\n\nApple's year-over-year revenue growth was its highest in the past three years.\n\nIs Apple finally getting serious about AI?\n\nThe big cloud hanging over Apple's business has been AI (what it calls \"Apple Intelligence\"), and the lack of urgency in the space compared to rivals like Alphabet and Microsoft. It seems Apple is beginning to take it more seriously and address this issue.\n\nA major advantage on Apple's side is the number of devices it has in people's pockets, homes, and offices. Ideally, Apple can integrate AI into its various hardware, giving people even more of a reason to choose it over competitors. This has been the plan for a while, but it hasn't gone as smoothly or as quickly as most people thought or hoped.\n\nThat should change soon, with Apple's management noting on its latest earnings call that Apple is \"increasing [its] investment significantly in AI,\" both in infrastructure and company personnel. In its latest quarter, Apple spent nearly $3.5 billion on capital expenditures, its most since its fiscal quarter that ended in January 2023.\n\nApple has always moved cautiously and with intention. These new AI investment developments don't strike me as the company just now coming to its senses, but more so Apple feeling like now is the right time (a lagging stock price sure helps it come to that realization).\n\nApple's stock looks like a good entry point for investors\n\nAt the time of this writing, Apple is trading at 29 times its projected earnings for the next year. That's the second-lowest out of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks and below the 35 it was at to start this year.\n\nThat alone doesn't make Apple a buy right now, but it does give it a lot more upside now than before. This is especially true if its new AI prioritization plays out as management envisions. With $133 billion in cash and marketable securities to its name, Apple has all the resources it needs to ensure it keeps pace in the AI race.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:36:03.995184+00:00"}

Using the average charging cost of 4.56 cents per mile and typical monthly driving of 1,100 miles, this calculates to approximately $50 per month for home charging. For comparison, charging exclusively at home could increase your electric bill by $50-$100 monthly, according to GOBankingRates.\n\nExplore More: I Sold My Tesla ‚Äî Here‚Äôs How Much I Got for It and What I‚Äôm Driving Instead\n\nSubaru Forester Monthly Gas Costs\n\nThe 2025 Subaru Forester achieves 29 MPG combined (26 city in the city, 33 on highway), according to Edmunds. Using current national gas prices of approximately $3.20 per gallon and typical monthly driving of 1,100 miles, this calculates to about $122 per month in fuel costs for Forester owners.\n\nThe Cost Comparison\n\nBased on these calculations, Tesla owners spend roughly $50 monthly on electricity, while Forester drivers pay about $122 for gas. This represents potential monthly savings of approximately $72 when choosing Tesla over the Subaru Forester.\n\nOver a year, Tesla drivers could save around $864 compared to Forester owners, assuming consistent home charging for Tesla and regular gas prices for the Forester.\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nHowever, the comparison isn‚Äôt purely about fuel costs. Charging at Tesla Supercharger stations costs about 25 cents per kWh, meaning a full recharge to 250 miles would cost about $22, which is more expensive than home charging but still competitive with gas prices.\n\nTesla‚Äôs lower operating costs extend beyond fuel savings, including reduced maintenance requirements compared to traditional gas engines. Meanwhile, the Forester offers advantages like lower upfront costs, established service networks, and no range anxiety.\n\nFor budget-conscious drivers prioritizing monthly fuel expenses, Tesla provides significant savings over the Subaru Forester based on these calculations, making electric vehicle ownership increasingly attractive from a purely operational cost perspective.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much To Charge a Tesla Monthly vs. Gas for a Subaru Forester", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:36:08.372625+00:00"}

Its chips can be found in popular consumer products like Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox, and even the infotainment systems inside Tesla's electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, AMD's biggest opportunity right now is in the data center. The company is planning to launch a new lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI development in 2026, which could blow the competition -- including Nvidia (NVDA 1.05%) -- out of the water.\n\nAMD stock is up 34% in 2025 already, but it's still below its all-time high just north of $200, which was set last year. Should investors scoop it up while it's still trading at a discount? Read on to find out.\n\nAMD is catching up to Nvidia in the data center space\n\nAMD launched its flagship MI300X data center GPU at the end of 2023, more than a year after Nvidia's industry-leading H100 GPU hit the market. Despite being behind, AMD still managed to attract some of Nvidia's largest customers, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms.\n\nWhile Nvidia continues to leap ahead of the competition with new GPU architectures like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, AMD is quickly closing the gap. It just started shipping its MI350 series GPUs, which are based on a new architecture the company calls Compute DNA (CDNA) 4. These new chips offer 35 times more performance than CDNA 3 versions like the original MI300X, placing them on par with Nvidia's Blackwell lineup.\n\nIn fact, the latest MI355 offers comparable performance to Nvidia's Blackwell GB200 GPU, and it delivers up to 40% more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) in AI inference workloads for the same cost. In other words, it's much cheaper to run over the long term without sacrificing any processing power, which is why it's attracting hyperscalers and even leading AI start-ups like OpenAI.\n\nBut customers' attention is already turning to 2026, when AMD plans to release its MI400 series. These new chips will be combined with specialized software and hardware systems to create a fully integrated AI data center rack called Helios, which will supercharge their performance. AMD CEO Lisa Su believes these MI400-based Helios systems will be the most powerful in the world when they launch, offering a staggering 10 times more performance over the MI350 series.\n\nSimply put, 2026 could be the year that AMD overtakes Nvidia in the AI data center space, at least in terms of technological capability.\n\nAMD's AI data center revenue hit a speed bump in Q2\n\nAMD generated a record $7.7 billion in total revenue during the second quarter of 2025, which was a 32% increase from the year-ago period. The data center segment was responsible for $3.2 billion of that revenue on its own, but it only mustered 14% growth, which was somewhat disappointing given the competitive, high-stakes nature of the GPU market.\n\nExport restrictions were recently imposed by the U.S. government, and they wiped out AMD's AI GPU sales to China, which was the main reason for the underperformance in its data center segment. However, the company says it has applied for licenses to resume sales, and they are currently under review by the Trump administration.\n\nBut there was great news in other areas of AMD's business, like its client segment, where revenue soared 67% year over year to $2.5 billion. This is where the company accounts for sales of its Ryzen AI chips for personal computers, which come with a built-in GPU, central processing unit (CPU), and neural processing unit (NPU). They are installed in a growing number of computers from leading brands like Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus.\n\nAMD's gaming business also roared back to life in Q2, with revenue surging by 73% to $1.1 billion. Revenue declined in this segment last year, and also during the first quarter of 2025, but demand for some of the company's core products is starting to rebound. Console manufacturers are increasing their inventories in preparation for the holiday season, and AMD said demand for its new Radeon 9000 series desktop GPUs is exceeding supply.\n\nShould you buy AMD stock while it's under $200?\n\nDespite the temporary regulatory headwind in AMD's data center business, Lisa Su is as optimistic as ever about its potential. She believes the company's AI revenue will scale into the tens of billions of dollars per year over the long term, driven by the MI400 GPU, which is already experiencing strong customer interest even though it won't hit the market until next year.\n\nOn that note, is AMD stock a buy while it's still below its record high? The company generated $3.45 in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) over the last four quarters, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46.8. That means it's notably cheaper than Nvidia stock, which is sitting at a P/E ratio of 55.7.\n\nMoreover, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests AMD could deliver $5.97 in EPS during 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 27.1. That leaves room for significant upside, because the stock would have to soar by 73% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 46.8.\n\nIt's possible AMD stock will perform even better if the MI400 series blows the competition out of the water next year, like Su expects, so it could be a great addition to any diversified portfolio right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:36:10.121814+00:00"}

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Matt Frankel. I'm joined by my fellow longtime analyst Jon Quast, as well as the Motley Fools co founder and CEO Tom Gardner. Later in the show, we're going to be joined by fool.com analyst Jonathan Wilder. Today we're going to look at some recent earnings from Tesla, Chipotle, Alphabet, service now in IBM, and a little bit later, we are going to look at the Figma IPO that is coming up real soon. First, we're going to put Tesla's results under the microscope. It wasn't a big surprise, but Tesla reported a really weak second quarter. Automotive revenue was down 16% every year. The company has been losing EV market share to traditional automakers like GM. Some will say that Tesla's long term thesis is about a whole lot more than vehicle sales. Jon, what are your thoughts on this?\n\nJon Quast: Look Matt, I think if you're buying Tesla's stock today, you're not buying for the next year, you are looking for the next decade. Look, the report, it's shocking to see its primary revenue generator. Cars have a 16% drop. For any other company, this would be all out panic, but a lot of people say this is just vehicle sales for Tesla. First and foremost of those would be CEO Elon Musk. He says, on the earning call, everything with this business comes down to one word and that's autonomy. The idea is this company will make far more money in the future with its self driving software, with its robot taxis, with its optimist robot. All that is autonomy and that's really the thesis that Tesla Bowles and the CEO Elon Musk have for the company.\n\nMatt Frankel: Direct question here. Do you think Tesla's a buy right now?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah. As you're looking at it, if you're thinking through this grid of autonomy, if you're thinking through the grid of cars, then there's trouble right now. If you're thinking through the grid of autonomy, you really just have to extend that viewpoint way out because this isn't going to happen right away. Musk said that he's eyeing robot taxis for half the US population by the end of this year. But keywords there include probably and pending approval. Spoiler alert I'm almost positive there won't be that much regulatory approval by the end of the year. When it comes to optimist robot, look, they're trying to scale that up, but they're still working on the prototype Number 3 this year and hoping to get that done before the end of the year. I think that you're looking not at 2025 when it comes to Tesla, you need to be thinking 2035 if you're buying into this concept of autonomy today.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, I'd like to get your opinion on this. One of the key quotes that stood out to me from the earnings release was from Elon Musk. He said, we could probably have a few rough quarters, specifically referencing tariffs and the EB tax credits expiring. There's a lot at play here. How do you see the next year or so playing out for Tesla?\n\nTom Gardner: Well, I think it's going to be a bad year by any normal standard for a great growth company. This is not going to be a good year, but Elon Musk and Tesla. Tesla is a lot more than Elon Musk. I'm not meaning to diminish the huge impact he has on the business, but this is a massive company now and we have to understand that the really great companies aren't thinking about the next year. Jeff Bezos talked about this all the time at Amazon. Sometimes as analysts, we get really focused on what does this quarter look like? What's happening with the next 12 months for this business? But great business leaders are really looking forward much farther than that, we have to remember that in the backdrop for Tesla, they have $30 billion cash in net cash on their balance sheet. They have so much more capital, such a stronger balance sheet than anyone in automobiles. Musk's bet here, Tesla's bet is that we are moving to autonomy. It might take longer, there might be some issues in regulatory process on autonomous driving, but robot taxis are live and awesome. We see it with Waymo. We see a lot of high customer satisfaction, willingness to pay more. Obviously, there's not tipping going on, so you can pay a little extra, but it's going to be a premium feature. The last thing I'll say in my belief that Tesla will beat the market over the next five years.\n\nI do actually agree and have for a long time with what Musk said on the earnings call which is that he thinks Tesla will be the largest company in the world if autonomy plays out. I don't think that there's much question as whether it's going to play out. We'll see whether he's right about what will happen with Tesla. But remember, in the backdrop the idea is to have a million optimist robots in less than five years. There is, as Jon says, a lot that you're holding onto in belief. Let's see if this really plays out. I will say in hidden gems we've been an island because we're the only thing in the Motley Fool recommending the stock since 2012 with over 60 recommendations. The first one at about $2 a share. It's played out very well for us, but you cannot own the stock if a 30-50% decline in the price of the shares is going to knock you out because there's just no way you're going to avoid that. This stock will be down 40-60% multiple times. Every two or three years, you should expect a 30-40% decline in stock, in my opinion, and those have been and I believe will continue to be great opportunities to add.\n\nMatt Frankel: Let's pivot to Chipotle's earnings real quick. Unlike Tesla, investors are not that excited about what happened. They gave investors a not so pleasant surprise. They lowered their same store sales guidance for the year, same store traffic declined by 5% year over year. Tom, I know you follow Chipotle pretty closely as well. Is the week's second quarter something investors should really be worried about?\n\nTom Gardner: Not the quarter in itself, Matt, as we discussed with long term thinking for a business like Tesla. However, I'm on the record and my conviction is that, for example, Starbucks will be a better stock over the next five years than Chipotle. Part of that is just straight up Brian Nichol, the CEO who left Chipotle and is now at Starbucks. Is Brian Nichol closer to Michael Jordan, hoops fans know that Chicago Bulls won six NBA championships in eight years. Then when Jordan left in 1998 they have never been back into the championship series again. Sometimes you have an extraordinary leader and I think that is the case with Brian Nichol. My fear for Chipotle is that they're going to lose premium positioning now. We see flattening out same store sales growth. Restaurant margins in decline and obviously in this economic environment, which I think will persist because of a lot of the changes in the technology landscape and what will happen with employment, consumers are looking for discounts and getting lower priced protein in the form of chicken. Chipotle has has a billion and a half in cash flow. This is not a company in trouble at all. My fear is that it will become more of an operating company now rather than a vision driven business. That makes me think that this will be at best a market performer here over the next five years. As I said, I think Starbucks will outperform Chipotle with Brian Nichol as Starbucks a CEO.\n\nMatt Frankel: It's really important to put the quarter into context. Jon, just to name a few things. We got the initial tariff announcements at the start of the second quarter, stocks briefly plunged into a bear market. Consumers started becoming really cautious about discretionary spending, especially when that was going on. What are your thoughts on Chipotle as we head into the second half of the year?\n\nJon Quast: Look Matt, this is anecdotal, but I don't know personally, a single person who saw a tariff announcement on the news and said, Honey, maybe we should skip our Chipotle order this week. I would say that Chipotle is getting more pushback from other things. As Tom mentioned a minute ago, perhaps there's even a perception on value and portion sizes. This did actually come up last year with the company and they had to address it head on. It takes time to change a consumer perception of the business, whether it's real or it's just perceived, it takes time. I think we're still seeing that play out with the traffic being down, they didn't take any pricing. They've been taking pricing in recent years and getting to this point where I think consumers are reaching their limit. That is playing against them right now. I think that is what's happening rather than tariffs being something that are influencing consumers.\n\nLook I think that long term, I also agree with Tom that I think this is a company that is still fantastic operationally. Even with a rough quarter, you're looking at 18% operating profit margins. I know restaurants that would be happy with half of that. Long term, I think this still a company with a lot of promise, it's going to add many new restaurants in coming years. It's going to generate a lot of cash flow. I would agree though, is this going to become more of an operating thing? I'm not really sure that the unit economics are going to recover fully this year. It's going to take time to win back some consumers that have been lost.\n\nMatt Frankel: Next up, we're going to take a look at Alphabet's quarter, and it was a strong one. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nMALE_1: Does it ever feel like you're a marketing professional just speaking into the void?

Terms and conditions apply.\n\nMatt Frankel: Another one that just reported. Alphabet just reported really impressive results throughout its business. This is the Google parent company, of course. Google Cloud revenue was an extremely strong point with 32% revenue growth. That was an acceleration in the second quarter. Really, one of the biggest takeaways that I got from the report is that the AI investments they're making seem to be working, and management now expects to spend $85 billion in CapEx this year, primarily on building data centers and AI infrastructure up from the previous estimate of 75 billion. I'd love to get the thoughts from both of you but Jon, we'll start with you. What are your thoughts on the quarter and this aggressive AI investment strategy?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah, we human beings are so bad when it comes to big numbers like this. You said it just so casually and so many people are. But let's stop for a second. They raised their capital expenditure guidance by $10 billion. With this money you could buy Campbell Soup Company, 150-year-old business with products in every store across the United States. They could buy Huntington Engles. This is one of the only companies capable of building a nuclear powered aircraft carrier. That's just the amount that they raised the guidance by 10 billion. If you're talking 85 billion now, that's bigger than the GDP of Croatia, Sri Lanka, Panama. That is what they're spending this year on capital expenditures, and that's just one company in one year. This AI trend is unbelievable. When you look at the spending ratcheting up like that, I get really excited thinking about who is on the receiving end of those dollars. There's going to be spending on the GPUs. There's going to be spending on data centers. Power needs are going to be going up. There are so many ways that this can trickle throughout the economy that gets me really excited.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, all this AI spending could be worth it if they're getting a return and it looks like so far they are. What are your thoughts on just this general trend toward billions and billions of dollars being pumped into the AI infrastructure right now?\n\nTom Gardner: Yeah, the first thing is that the reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated. They've been making transitions in their search with Gemini. I'll talk about that in a second, but the business is fundamentally on very solid footing and now they are succeeding and utilizing that AI in profitable ways and breakthrough ways in their overall ecosystem. Google is a Cloud and AI story, and companies that aren't in the Cloud today and aren't accelerating AI every single day are going to be in deep, deep trouble and it's going to come a lot faster than people think. On the Cloud front, Google Cloud is taking market share now from AWS. Their revenue run rate for Google Cloud is $50 billion. Their operating margins raised up to 20% this quarter. Google Cloud is vibrant and a force for the company. On the AI front, Google's scaling Gemini across all those search. Search is essentially becoming a private label brand for Google now, like Kirkland at Costco or 365 at Whole Foods. The private label brand search, 60% of all searches are being resolved without any user click. Think about that. The Gemini feature where you're getting that AI expression when you search something on a mobile screen takes up 75% of screen space. Google is all in on Cloud and AI, and one of the ironies I see with that $85 billion CapEx and one of the things I see about that increase of 10 billion, as Jon said, up to $85 billion in CapEx is also a company that will be working people out of jobs at Google. What that is telling us is that this automation is real. It is significant. People who are investing in AI companies, but not using AI in their everyday life and at their companies are going to fall so far behind so quickly now.\n\nGoogle is just one of the many large technology companies that are demonstrating. This is real. This is enormous. We're betting our entire company to make sure that we're in leadership position in our category. For Google shareholders, thank heavens for that because if Google had fallen behind further, it would be harder and harder for them to catch up both on the Cloudfront and in terms of AI applications. The one caution I have for Google shareholders is just anti competitive practices and whether the regulators are going to get involved with that Gemini search now. Because Gemini search is saving them. They may be a decline in search coming to the Google platform because you can get so much right off Chat GPT or Cloud, Grok, etc, perplexity. But that Gemini application is bringing more and more revenue into search for Google. They're actually on solid footing with their search and the business is on solid footing and if they don't run into regulators, I think you've got a double digit market outperformer in Google from here.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, speaking of AI investment, service now I know that's a company you follow. They just posted a really strong second quarter. That was in my opinion, the strongest earnings report as far as the surprise of all the ones we're talking about. I believe their CEO would agree with you. Bill McDermott said in the earnings release, every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI. Even after today's upward move, the stock's still down in 2025. For one, I'm pretty sure you agree with their CEO, but two, what do you make of their future growth prospects now?\n\nTom Gardner: Well, I think the growth prospects are bright for service now. They have excellent underlying financials. You see 30% operating margins just about just short of that, 98% renewal rates among their customers. This is a fantastic business being run quite successfully. I do agree, as you mentioned and mentioned from Bill McDermott, that AI is the new UI that all future product development is coming through AI, fundamentally, all B to C experiences, all consumer experiences and dig will be on AI applications. The one question I have as a service now shareholder ourselves at the Motley Fool is the company has a $200 billion market cap. I think it can outperform the market, but we see those great earnings leading to a marginal increase in the stock today and that's partially just because it's such a richly valued company. A lot of element areas of the market are richly priced right now. I just be patient. Every time you get a chance to buy service now when it's down 10 or 15%, I take advantage of that, and I think you'll be rewarded with profitable investments.\n\nMatt Frankel: Next up, we're going to take a look at IBM's earnings real quick and Figma's upcoming IPO. I'm excited to talk about that.\n\nMALE_1: LD super six fruit and veg comes with a freshness guarantee from just 29 peach red grape fruit, spring onions, pinkeds, apples, and mixed peppers, plus British Jersey roll potatoes and cherries, and the cherry on top. Amazing LD value in store now. LD which cheapest supermarket 2024. Products and prices may vary subject to availability.\n\nMatt Frankel: Jon, IBM shares are down after earnings despite beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The key reason seems to be that the management team is really cautious right now. The CEO said some clients are being cautious due to trade tensions, US federal spending is down, and there are a few other reasons. What are your thoughts on IBM's quarter and is the stock a buy right now?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah, I was surprised that the stock was down after looking over the numbers. Most of the metrics were up and above expectations. Of course, we should keep in mind that with the drop it's still outperforming the S&P 500 over the last year and year to date so context matters I think. But look when it comes to IBM, I think it's really easy to dismiss it from the artificial intelligence conversation because it's such an old business. It doesn't scream AI to me, but all these businesses out there right now are trying to figure out how do use AI in our company and many of them don't know how to do that. That means that they need consulting. It turns out that IBM is pretty good at this. CEO Arvin Krishna said it's book of business for generative AI is now at 7.5 billion and accelerating. Essentially, companies are coming to IBM and looking to how do we integrate AI into what we're doing. That means that they're really actually pretty well positioned and probably better positioned than a lot of investors give them credit for.\n\nNow, granted, IBM only expects about 5% revenue growth this year. Usually when I'm looking at a tech stock to buy, I want to see a little bit better growth in this. That said, over the last couple of years I've just had this growing conviction that IBM is better positioned than people give them credit for. For me, it is a stock to watch.\n\nMatt Frankel: Well, maybe Warren Buffet shouldn't have sold it when he did. Now let's get to the story that I've been really looking forward to. We're going to talk about Figma's IPO. Jonathan, I want to bring you in on this. We're starting to see a resurgence in IPO activity and one big, highly anticipated IPO that's about to go public is Figma. Before we dive in, can you just give us a 32nd description of what Figma does?\n\nJonathan Wilder: Figma is essentially a Google Docs, essentially for UIUX, it allows collaboration between multiple designers to create rapid prototypes which can then be put into the prototype present feedback and iterate loop, which most corporations use to develop new products. That's essentially what they do.\n\nMatt Frankel: Talking to you before the show, I think it would be fair to say, maybe this is an understatement that you're not entirely bullish on the growth story here. Can you tell us why you're approaching Figma with so much caution?\n\nJonathan Wilder: First came out in 2012. They are very much, in my view attached to a an older way of developing products, which again, going back to that is very much the prototype present feedback and iterate. That process can take days, weeks or even months in a typical corporation. With generative AI, that can go down to literally 30 minutes. Instead of getting one prototype back from a design team, you're getting 5-10 prototypes back in less than a day. That alone is a huge disruption for Figma. It's a huge disruption for Adobe and any companies in this space. That's my major. Actually, one example is Galileo is a generative AI competitor to Figma. They were just purchased by Google about a month and a half ago, renamed Stitch and made available completely for free. If you're taking a look at a $75 seat license for FIGMA, you now have an option just to use Google Stitch for free. If I come from a start-up background, and if I raised $5 million at a $20 million valuation, I have the option, should I hire a FIGMA expert for 140 or $150,000 a year or should I just hire AI bots in the form of Stitch, Galileo, and some other versions of AI versions of a Figma and save myself a huge amount of money. I think currently, large corporations are the ones that are stuck on Figma. However as a good example is the Parsons School of Design in New York City are actively now beginning to teach generative AI design. The new designers that are coming out, the younger designers that are entering the workforce, the first tools that they're going toward are generative AI tools. They do not go to Figma. They do not go to Photoshop, even at this point. That's my main thesis, where I'm not too bullish on it.\n\nJon Quast: Jonathan, I think a lot of investors would be reading over the S1 when it comes to Figma and looking at that 46% year over year revenue growth. I think there's a sense that the generative AI trend is already mature. How do we take what you've just shared about the business and maybe some of the risks. But then also how do we counterbalance that with the 46% revenue growth that we see?\n\nJonathan Wilder: Generative AI really started in 2018, 2019 with the transformer architecture. That was first released for the public with Chat GPT in late 2022. However, the generative AI scope of what it's covering it first started to attack coding, the models are continuously being evolved. It then started doing things with the Chat GPT of image generation, runway with video generation, and this area of rapid prototyping is something that is not necessarily a focus of generative AI because if you use something like a cursor or a wind surf you can actually bypass Figma completely because as you're building a design using one of those tools or a bolt is you can ask with very specific prompts to build the design. It will also build the code at the background and will also deploy the code and the design live to a hosting environment. You're talking about Google earlier, Google's doing a very good job of integrating all of these types of tools, and that's why they purchased Stitch, where once you create a design on Stitch, which you would have done previously in FIGMA, now it's already creating the code.\n\nWith one click, it's in Google Colab, which is their development environment and another click, it's in Google Cloud. FIGMA does not have any of that type of functionality built in. The pace of how that's going to evolve is, I would say, exponential over the next year. Most of what Figma has put on in terms of generative AI, I see mostly as band aids, marketing hype. It's unclear what they'll do over the next year. They can turn it around and put really useful generative AI tools within their interface which hasn't changed a huge amount, really in the past decade. Those [MUSIC] are my major concerns.\n\nMatt Frankel: Thanks Jonathan, for that clarity on Figma. It will be really interesting to watch once that one goes public next week.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nA group of former Tesla HR professionals alleged that they were either fired or effectively forced to resign after attempting to surface other employees‚Äô race discrimination and retaliation complaints at the company‚Äôs Fremont, California, plant, in a complaint filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nPer the lawsuit, Peloquin, et. al. v. Tesla, Inc. , one of the incidents reported by plaintiffs involved a Black employee who received racially charged threats from a White co-worker. An HR employee investigated the incident and recommended that the co-worker be fired, but Tesla allegedly instead forced the HR employee out after firing his supervisor.\n\nOther plaintiffs claimed they sent emails to high-ranking Tesla managers complaining of an ‚Äúextraordinarily high attrition rate‚Äù of HR professionals at the Fremont facility as well as retaliation against HR employees. These plaintiffs alleged they were similarly fired after making their complaints. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe wide-ranging lawsuit concerns a facility that has featured heavily in previous litigation against Tesla. The automaker‚Äôs Fremont facility has been the target of both state and federal regulators over the last several years due to allegations of racial harassment against Black employees and retaliation against workers who complained about harassment.\n\nIn March 2024, the company settled a nearly decade-long case involving an employee who claimed that he and other Black employees were subjected to harassment by co-workers. Federal juries twice sided with the plaintiff at trial, awarding millions of dollars in damages.\n\nAccording to the Peloquin complaint, one of Tesla‚Äôs HR managers was a ‚Äúcommon denominator‚Äù in the various claims made by the plaintiffs. They alleged that the manager, the overall HR manager for the entire Fremont facility, ‚Äúhad an irrational fixation on fostering the delusion that the environment and culture at Tesla is one of tolerance and innovation, rather than racism and retaliation.‚Äù\n\nOne of the plaintiffs, who is a gay man, claimed that the HR manager ‚Äúunilaterally placed him‚Äù in a LGBTQ affinity group for Tesla employees without his permission or consent. When he complained about this decision to a higher-up, the manager initiated an investigation of him and directed a supervisor to terminate him, he alleged.\n\nIn all, the plaintiffs alleged unlawful retaliation, disability discrimination, wrongful termination and failure to prevent unlawful discrimination in violation of California state law.\n\nTesla‚Äôs HR department previously was highlighted in a 2022 lawsuit that claimed the department and management of a Nevada worksite ignored obscene and misogynistic music, allowing an alleged sexually hostile work environment to persist. The parties to that case later determined that an arbitration agreement applied to the dispute.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T13:51:01.151932+00:00"}

In that context, today‚Äôs move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock gained 3.1% on the news that its board of directors approved a new multi-billion dollar compensation package for CEO Elon Musk. The package, which included an award of 96 million shares valued at nearly $30 billion, reassured investors by securing Musk‚Äôs continued leadership. This move was particularly significant because Musk had previously suggested he might develop products outside of Tesla if his ownership stake was not increased. The board's action came after a court had previously voided a different pay package. The stock's climb also occurred during a broader market upswing that lifted other large technology companies.\n\nTesla is down 12.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $330.92 per share, it is trading 31% below its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla‚Äôs shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,499.\n\nUnless you‚Äôve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

The official document was signed off by Andrew Payne, who is cited as the company‚Äôs director. His LinkedIn page shows him as listed as head of energy for the EMEA region of Tesla.\n\nAs well as being the world‚Äôs most recognized maker of electric cars, Tesla has a business supplying battery storage and solar energy.\n\nLast year, the firm saw its revenue from the sale of solar cells, batteries and other energy products nearly double, rising $1.5 billion or 93% compared to a year earlier.\n\nMusk, one of the world‚Äôs richest people, was last week awarded a $29 billion pay package from the firm. Tesla, of which he is the CEO, already supplies electricity to residential properties in Texas.\n\nThe application comes at a time when the firm‚Äôs main business ‚Äì car sales ‚Äì is on the decline. Tesla‚Äôs (TSLA) auto revenue fell 16% from April to June and overall revenue was down 12%, according to its earnings report. Sales of its best-selling Model Y and Model 3 fell 12% compared with a year ago, while sales of its more expensive models, including the Cybertruck, plunged 52%.\n\nSales of new Teslas fell by 60% in July in the UK compared to a year ago, according to the Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders (SMMT). Meanwhile, yearly sales dropped by 22% across Europe, according to June figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers‚Äô Association.\n\nThe significant drop in sales, not only in the US but around the world, are widely perceived to have been a backlash to Musk‚Äôs political activities, as well as the growing competition from other electric vehicle makers, most notably from China.\n\nBack in 2023 Tesla advertised on LinkedIn for a head of operations to run Tesla Electric in the UK.

Not just a small improvement over today‚Äôs lithium-ion cells, but a leap forward in energy density, charging speed and safety. The answer, they believe, lies in solid-state lithium-metal technology.\n\nFor drivers, this shift promises cleaner, greener transportation‚Äîand maybe the end of stressful commutes. For investors, it‚Äôs one of the most dynamic areas in the market. Our Electric Vehicles & Autonomous Driving Screen will help you identify companies with strong potential in this high-growth sector. Stocks like QuantumScape Corp. QS, Lucid Group LCID and XPeng Inc. XPEV are worth watching as the race toward an electrified, autonomous future accelerates.\n\nThe autonomous vehicle (AV) market is also speeding ahead. Valued at about $1.9 trillion in 2023, it‚Äôs expected to soar to over $13.6 trillion by 2030, at an impressive 32% CAGR, per Fortune Business Insights. Advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, sensors and connectivity are making AVs smarter and safer. Better perception, faster decision-making and more reliable systems are moving us closer to a world where cars can drive themselves with minimal human input.\n\nA few years back, an ‚Äúelectric car‚Äù was practically synonymous with Tesla TSLA. But the field has now become crowded. Concerns over climate change and big gains in battery range and charging speeds are making EVs more appealing. Legacy automakers like General Motors GM are going all-in on electrification. Startups such as Rivian Automotive RIVN are also gaining ground. Meanwhile, Chinese brands are flooding the market with a wide range of models and looking to expand globally.\n\nElectric and self-driving cars are reshaping the auto industry. According to the latest report on global EV outlook by International Energy Agency, electric vehicle (EV) sales are expected to jump 25% in 2025, topping 20 million units worldwide. This surge comes as battery prices fall and EVs become more affordable. China is set to dominate, accounting for nearly two-thirds of all sales, followed by Europe and the United States. By year-end, one in every four cars sold could be electric. China also leads in choice‚Äîalmost 60% of models available there are electric, compared with just 12% in the United States.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne of QuantumScape‚Äôs biggest allies in this journey is Volkswagen. The German auto giant, through its battery arm PowerCo, has been backing the company for years. And last month, that relationship deepened. The two announced an expanded collaboration to accelerate development of the QSE-5 battery and set up a pilot production line in San Jose. As part of the deal, PowerCo will provide up to $131 million in milestone-based payments over the next two years‚Äîon top of the $130 million already tied to a future licensing agreement. Volkswagen isn‚Äôt just investing; it‚Äôs likely to be QuantumScape‚Äôs first customer.\n\nThat fits neatly into QuantumScape‚Äôs capital-light strategy. Instead of building massive, capital-intensive factories, the company plans to license its technology to automakers and battery producers‚Äîletting them handle the heavy lifting of manufacturing at scale.\n\nThe company also hit a key milestone in June with its Cobra separator process. Cobra replaces the older Raptor system and is a game-changer: 25 times faster, more compact and far more cost-efficient. In the race to bring solid-state batteries to market, that matters.\n\nWith B1 sample production on the horizon and early field tests planned for 2026, QuantumScape is inching closer to turning its vision into a commercial product‚Äîone that could help shape the future of electric mobility. QS stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today‚Äôs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nLucid: When Lucid burst onto the EV scene, it made waves with the Air sedan‚Äîa sleek, high-performance luxury car. Now, the company has moved beyond its luxury Air sedan with the Gravity SUV, targeting the broader premium SUV market. CEO Peter Rawlinson believes Gravity could be a game-changer, pointing out that its addressable market is six times larger than that of Air.\n\nTo support that growth, Lucid is locking in key parts of its supply chain. A new multi-year deal with Graphite One secures U.S.-sourced natural graphite‚Äîan important step toward building a localized, resilient EV materials network.\n\nLucid operates at the top end of the market, with Air starting above $70,000 and Gravity just under $80,000. But the company is also making ownership more appealing. Effective July 31, 2025, Lucid vehicles have become compatible with Tesla‚Äôs Supercharger network, giving drivers access to over 23,500 charging stations across North America. That‚Äôs a major convenience boost and would help drive more Air sales.\n\nLucid is also pushing into autonomous mobility. In a major deal with Uber, the company will supply more than 20,000 vehicles equipped with Nuro‚Äôs self-driving tech. Uber has sweetened the partnership with a $300 million investment‚Äîboth a financial cushion and a built-in sales channel as Lucid EVs join Uber‚Äôs global fleet.\n\nOn the software side, Lucid rolled out over-the-air updates, with new driver-assist features late last month. And with the backing of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Public Investment Fund, which has invested around $9 billion since 2018, Lucid has the financial muscle to keep its ambitions on track. LCID currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nXPeng: In China‚Äôs fast-moving electric vehicle market, XPeng is emerging as one of the most exciting names to watch. Riding the wave of booming new energy vehicle (NEV) sales and strong government backing, the company is scaling rapidly.\n\nXPeng‚Äôs strategy centers on intelligence-driven cars built for tech-savvy buyers. Its lineup is diverse, covering everything from sleek sedans to family-friendly SUVs. Standouts include the G9, a roomy mid-to-large SUV; the P7i, a sporty sedan; the G6, a coupe-style SUV; and the seven-seat X9 MPV. The value-priced MONA M03 is aimed at budget-conscious buyers, while the P7+ caters to families looking for style and space.\n\nIn June, XPeng added G7, a crossover positioned between G6 and G9. It‚Äôs the first model to feature XPeng‚Äôs in-house Turing AI chip, which delivers triple the computing power of standard smart driving chips. That gives G7 a serious advantage in self-driving performance‚Äîone that could help XPeng stand out in a crowded field.\n\nThe sales numbers tell an equally compelling story. In 2024, XPeng delivered more than 190,000 vehicles, up 34% year over year. But 2025 has taken growth to another level. The first quarter alone saw 94,008 deliveries‚Äîa staggering 331% increase from a year earlier. In the second quarter, XPeng smashed records again with 103,181 cars sold, more than double its year-ago numbers.\n\nInnovation is moving just as fast. The company‚Äôs AI-powered Hawkeye Vision System and XOS 5.4 operating system push its full-stack smart driving ambitions forward. And XPeng is already experimenting with futuristic concepts like flying cars and humanoid robots‚Äîsignaling that it‚Äôs thinking well beyond today‚Äôs roads. Once considered an underdog, XPeng is now racing toward the front of China‚Äôs EV pack. XPEV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Ford said the vehicle will arrive in 2027, with more details to come at a future date.\n\nThe platform will allow the company to make all kinds of form factors, such as sedans, SUVs, and vans, built at scale and with simplicity. Ford said the number of parts will be far fewer and the vehicles will be lighter.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley called it a \"Model T\" moment for the automaker, boldly claiming that this platform, as well as its production process, will revolutionize how the company makes its future EVs.\n\n\"We took a radical approach to solve a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that are breakthrough in every way that matters ‚Äî design, technology, performance, space and cost of ownership ‚Äî and do it with American workers,\" Farley said in a statement.\n\nLast year, Ford's Model e EV unit lost $5.1 billion, and the company expects losses to stay the same in 2025. The company sold 105,000 EVs, meaning the company lost around $48.5K per EV sold.\n\nThose numbers need to change, and Farley and Ford believe both the new platform and production strategy will flip the EV business into the green starting in 2027.\n\nFord said its Universal Assembly Process will make efficiency key to building these new EVs.

Search revenue topped out at $54.1bn versus an anticipated $52.7bn. YouTube ad revenue was $9.8bn versus expectations of $9.5bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud Platform revenue hit $13.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $13.1bn.\n\nThe company's outlook for capital expenditures (capex), however, was higher than expected. The tech giant expects to spend $85bn in the year, $10bn more than had been previously expected.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nBen Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the concerns around disruption from artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, Alphabet produced a really good set of numbers in its latest results. Revenues were up 15%, three percentage points better than expected and the search business delivered at the top of its range. The cloud business, meanwhile, was also a strong performer with revenues up 32% so it is encouraging to see the business growing strongly in the face of pressures.\"\n\nHe said that the increase in its capex guidance \"is a very solid raise and should be viewed as a positive, with investment looking to drive away the threat of Chat GPT\".\n\n\"Alphabet has been playing catch up somewhat in the AI arms race, but it is doing well to fend off the likes of Chat GPT,\" said Barringer. \"The big question will be whether it can keep innovating at a pace that allows it to maintain its search monopoly. This boost in investment suggests the fight will continue.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the next big event on the horizon for Alphabet's Google is a judge's ruling in an search antitrust case. Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to issue a ruling on \"remedies\" that follows the Justice Department's victory against the company sometime next month.\n\n\"While it is unlikely to be the end of the saga regardless of the result, any indication that its search monopoly will weaken will not be taken well by the market, especially given the AI threat currently,\" said Barringer. \"This ruling has the potential to either be a clearing event or add to Alphabet‚Äôs uncertainties.

Its cloud business, Azure, saw revenues grow 39%, well ahead of expectations, highlighting that demand for more traditional cloud based services remains strong. Microsoft has a good backlog in this business area too so we should see strong results continue to flow there.\n\n‚ÄúThe company did announce it was slowing the growth of its capex and changing the mix slightly, but as demand remains strong for AI we will likely see the likes of data centres take priority for a number of years yet.\n\nMeta (META) ‚Äì Released second quarter results on Wednesday 30 July\n\nFacebook-parent Meta (META) surged 12% on Thursday after posting a bumper set of results after the market close on 30 July.\n\nMeta said revenue for the three months to the end of June rose 22% from the same period last year to $47.5bn. Meanwhile, profits jumped by 36% to $18.3bn. Profit per share came in at $7.14, above analysts' estimates.\n\nThe company said it expected its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114bn and $118bn. The company added its AI initiatives will ‚Äúresult in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.‚Äù\n\n\"I think there are all these questions that people have about what are going to be the timelines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence ... we've observed the more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen.

Average price per ad was up 9% over the quarter, a clear indication that Meta is delivering an improved product for both users and advertisers.\n\n\"The broader focus now turns to Meta's mammoth AI investment plans and whether it can continue to manage those costs without hurting earnings or free cash flow.\n\n\"CFO commentary called out higher costs next year, and another year of similar capex growth, which many analysts did not have on their bingo cards.

Revenue of $94.04bn was better than the expected $89.30bn. Mac and iPhone revenue were both better than analysts had anticipated, while wearables and iPad numbers fell short. Greater China revenue was $15.37bn compared to an estimate of $15.19bn.\n\nApple expects tariffs to cost the company $1.1bn this quarter, CEO Tim Cook told investors on the earnings call. That's after the iPhone maker took a tariff-related hit to the tune of $800m during the fiscal third quarter which ran through June.\n\nServices revenue, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Pay, came in at $27.4bn, up about 13% year-on-year, continuing its double-digit growth.\n\nCook said Apple (AAPL) was increasing its AI investments. ‚ÄúWe did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter,‚Äù he told analysts, without giving specific numbers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook warned in a second quarter earnings call at the beginning of May that tariffs were expected to add $900m to costs in the third quarter. ¬∑ REUTERS / Reuters\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Britzman said: \"Apple is caught in a sentiment trap. On paper, the company delivered one of its strongest sets of results in recent years ‚Äì robust iPhone sales, a return to growth in China, and encouraging guidance. Ordinarily, that would send shares meaningfully higher. There‚Äôs a sense of unease hanging over Apple, something we haven‚Äôt seen in a long time. Scepticism around its AI positioning, combined with lingering tariff uncertainty, continues to weigh on investor confidence.\"\n\n\"Apple should be a leading name in AI hardware, but that‚Äôs simply not the case,\" he added. \"Apple Intelligence was a flop, so a lot of hope now lies in an AI-powered Siri ‚Äì but that might not come until next year.

Market experts had estimated the company would report around $162bn in revenue and 9% growth. The company‚Äôs Amazon Web Services cloud computing division reported its sales reached $30.9bn in an increase of 17.5% year over year.\n\nHowever, Amazon projected that operating income in the third quarter would be $15.5bn-$20.5bn, which fell short of analyst expectations of $19.4bn.\n\nChief executive Andy Jassy warned of further uncertainty around Trump‚Äôs tariff policies and said he remained ‚Äúunsure‚Äù who would absorb potentially higher costs over time.\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nHe also gave a clear indication that the e-commerce giant will continue its AI push. \"AI is going to be the biggest transformation of our lifetime,‚Äù he said during a call with analysts on Thursday. ‚ÄúEvery single area of the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by AI.\"\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Just as it looked as if investors were ready to go all-in to big tech again, Amazon has come along and spoiled the party. A negative reaction to its results and a lacklustre response to Apple‚Äôs numbers would suggest the market has become more discerning.\"\n\n\"It is spending big on AI infrastructure, leading to more subdued profit guidance than expected,\" he said. \"The retail side of its business is caught up in Trump‚Äôs spiderweb of tariffs, which creates ongoing uncertainty.\"\n\n‚ÄúCompetition remains fierce for cloud computing services and Amazon‚Äôs sales growth rate is struggling to match rivals Microsoft and Alphabet,\" Coatsworth added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) ‚Äì Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 27 August\n\nAs an enabler of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings have become a major event in the earnings calendar, with some build up to the release of its results as it tends to report later in the season.\n\nInvestor expectations have become increasingly high around Nvidia's earnings, with markets sensitive to any signs of slowdown for the chip giant.\n\nThe stock has seen a marked rebound following turbulence in the first few months of the year amid the DeepSeek AI market shock and Trump's tariff agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed curbs on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China in April. Shares popped last week after the company said that it would resume sales of its H20 chips in China. Nvidia said that the US government had assured the company that licences will be granted, with the chipmaker adding that it hoped to start deliveries soon.\n\nThe recovery in Nvidia shares since mid-April lows has meant the stock is now up 25% year-to-date and recently saw the company become the first publicly traded company to pass the $4tn market capitalisation milestone.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia beat expectations, posting revenue of $44.1bn compared with an expected $43.29bn. The chipmaker guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2% for the second quarter.\n\nGoing into the second-quarter earnings, Britzman warned that investors shouldn't expect \"any meaningful impact\" from the recent turnaround on H20 chip curbs, given the timeframe.\n\n\"However, taking a conservative view, new Chinese sales could drive a $10bn uplift in revenue by year-end, potentially more if things move fast,\" he said. \"NVIDIA may also be able to reverse some of the $4.5bn inventory write-down from the first quarter, providing a direct boost to earnings.\"\n\nHe added: \"Outside of China, overall demand remains critical. Markets have already heard from major customers that data centre expansion is a priority, which should benefit Nvidia.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T15:12:26.305218+00:00"}

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla‚Äôs driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference ‚Äì meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots ‚Äì and large-scale AI training.\n\n‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,‚Äù Musk posted late Friday evening. ‚ÄúThe Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.‚Äù\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put ‚Äúmany AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOne could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,‚Äù he said.\n\nMusk has talked about Dojo since 2019, reiterating that Dojo would be a cornerstone of Tesla‚Äôs mission to achieve full self-driving and commercialize humanoid robots. Talk of Dojo halted around August 2024 when Musk began touting Cortex instead, a ‚Äúgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs not clear if Cortex is still in the works. TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla to learn more, as well as to inquire about the fate of the Dojo facility Tesla had invested $500 million to build in Buffalo, New York.\n\nThe shift in strategy comes at a time when Tesla is experiencing falling EV sales and significant brand damage after Musk‚Äôs forays into politics. Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T15:20:02.646837+00:00"}

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this electric car maker have returned +4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has gained 8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nTesla is expected to post earnings of $0.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -34.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -31.4%. This estimate has changed -11.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.51 indicates a change of +50.8% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:04:33.383675+00:00"}

Giving software and systems the capacity to make split-second decisions without human oversight is a game-changer for most industries around the globe. It's also the reason analysts at PwC foresee AI boosting worldwide gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion come 2030.\n\nWhile most Wall Street analysts have lofty expectations for the AI revolution, billionaire money managers have been more tempered with their optimism.\n\nFor example, Duquesne Family Office's billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller was an active seller of a number of brand-name AI stocks during the March-ended quarter. We know this, because institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter. A 13F provides a concise snapshot of which stocks the smartest fund managers have been buying and selling.\n\nWhile Druckenmiller was sending shares of AI-data mining specialist Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.57%) and North American electric-vehicle (EV) leader Tesla (TSLA 4.74%) to the chopping block, he was also piling into an AI-driven business with an estimated addressable market of $50 billion.\n\nPopular AI stocks get the heave-ho from billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller\n\nBetween Dec. 31, 2024, and March 31, 2025, Duquesne's billionaire chief was a busy bee. The total number of securities overseen by Druckenmiller dropped from 78 to 52 in just three months. Two of the more prominent stocks that were pared down or jettisoned include Tesla, which was reduced by 50% (18,837 shares sold), and Palantir, where all 41,710 shares were sold.\n\nThere's no denying that both companies have enjoyed clearly defined competitive advantages. Palantir's government-focused Gotham platform has no one-for-one replacement, while its enterprise-driven Foundry service lacks large-scale competition. As for Tesla, it became the first automaker in more than a half-century to successfully build itself from the ground up to mass-production.\n\nHowever, these first-mover and scaling advantages didn't protect either stock from being reduced or removed.\n\nConsidering that the stocks overseen by Druckenmiller have an average hold time of less than nine months, it's quite possible this selling activity represents nothing more than profit-taking.\n\nShares of Palantir and Tesla both surged following Donald Trump's November victory. Palantir is a logical winner of a unified Republican government that (likely) favors strong defense spending. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk temporarily joining the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as a special employee was viewed as a positive for Tesla.\n\nThe worry is there may be more to this story than just benign profit-taking. While this is merely speculation, Stanley Druckenmiller may have been turned off by Palantir's and Tesla's respective nosebleed valuations.\n\nTesla's EVs, which heavily incorporate AI, have endured more than a half-dozen sweeping price cuts as competition picked up and inventory levels rose. This has pummeled Tesla's vehicle margin and reduced its earnings per share (EPS). Paying close to 130 times forward-year earnings for a company whose growth engine has stalled, and whose margins are floundering, may not be appealing to Duquesne's billionaire chief.\n\nLikewise, Palantir Technologies is valued at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of more than 140! To offer some context, companies that are leading next-big-thing trends have historically topped out with P/S ratios in the range of 30 to 40. No megacap company has ever been able to maintain such an absurd premium as that of Palantir. Seeing this may have coerced Druckenmiller to take his chips completely off the table.\n\nDuquesne's billionaire chief is piling into this up-and-coming artificial intelligence stock\n\nOn other end of the spectrum, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller oversaw the addition of one dozen new stocks to his fund's portfolio during the March-ended quarter. None of these new stocks was purchased more prominently than digital-signatures specialist DocuSign (DOCU -1.62%).\n\nDuring the first three months of 2025, Duquesne Family Office purchased 1,074,655 shares of DocuSign, which had a market value of approximately $87.5 million. In other words, it became a top-10 holding for Druckenmiller.\n\nDocuSign became a Wall Street darling during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. With people encouraged to stay in their homes to prevent a worsening of the pandemic, DocuSign's e-signature services became a staple in a host of industries. Though life has returned to normal in the wake of the pandemic, DocuSign has managed to hang onto the bulk of digital-signature market share. According to Datanyze, it currently holds a 71% share.\n\nBut e-signatures make up just around half of DocuSign's total addressable market. While the digital-signature market is estimated to be worth $26 billion, DocuSign has a fast-growing, high-margin opportunity in contract lifecycle management (CLM) that makes up another $24 billion in addressable opportunity.\n\nThe company's cloud-based CLM operations includes the relatively new Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform, which leans on AI insights to analyze, tailor, and automate the entirety of the agreement lifecycle for businesses. DocuSign's IAM platform can also reduce errors associated with agreements and be integrated with other core systems, such as customer relationship management software, to improve efficiency.\n\nAlthough competition is picking up in the e-signature arena, and DocuSign's annual growth rate has slowed considerably from the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's balance sheet and valuation may be added lures for Druckenmiller.\n\nWhen DocuSign's fiscal first quarter came to a close on April 30, it had nearly $1.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and investments on its balance sheet, along with no debt. A pristine balance sheet has allowed for a steady diet of share repurchases, which tend to have a positive impact on EPS over time.\n\nIn terms of valuation, DocuSign is trading at 19 times forecast EPS for fiscal 2027. Even accounting for a slower annual growth rate, this represents a 37% discount to its average forward price-to-earnings ratio over the last half-decade.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:04:49.196667+00:00"}

In the case of Tesla (TSLA 4.71%), the range of possible outcomes is broad, and investors should consider it a high-risk but potentially high-reward stock. Here's what you need to know before buying the stock.\n\nTesla's fortunes depend on its robotaxi and unsupervised full self-driving offerings\n\nMost investment valuations for Tesla proscribe significantly more value to the company from its robotaxi and full self-driving (FSD) software (supervised and unsupervised).\n\nIn other words, while the electric vehicle business is critical to the company, it's not where most of the value lies. No one, except the most committed naysayers, values Tesla purely as a car company. It's a good idea to think of Tesla in a year in terms of the following considerations:\n\nTesla's electric vehicle (EV) deliveries have declined by 13% year over year for the last two quarters as relatively high interest rates make buying cars more expensive, and CEO Elon Musk has acknowledged that Tesla \"could have a few rough quarters\" due to the removal of federal EV tax credits.\n\nWhere will the robotaxi rollout be then, and what does it mean for the rest of the business?\n\nTesla's EV sales\n\nThe company's EV deliveries (equating to its sales volume, as Tesla sells direct to the consumer) are currently declining, and so is its market share globally and in the U.S. That said, there are some nuances in the sales figures that investors need to consider. There is a fascinating dynamic at play whereby Tesla is seeing a significant decline in its most popular SUV, Model Y, compared to its more sporty, but less expensive, sedan, Model 3.\n\nAccording to Kelley Blue Book EV automotive sales data, Tesla Model 3 sales/deliveries were up almost 38% year to date in the first half on a year-over-year basis. Interpolating the data shows that Tesla's U.S. sales, excluding the Model Y, were up 14.1% year to date in the first half on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThis fact makes it somewhat implausible that Tesla, at least in the U.S., is facing a buyer's strike due to Musk's political opinions, as it's hard to imagine why buyers would decide to avoid buying the Model Y but not the Model 3.\n\nThe reality is that Tesla's sales decline in 2026 is really a story of the Model Y decline, mainly due to the release of price-competitive EV SUVs, and a pause in sales as deliveries of the refreshed Model Y only started in March.\n\nNaturally, the company is aware of the price competitiveness issue, and it's not a coincidence that the new affordable model, set to be available in the fourth quarter, is just a Model Y, according to Musk, albeit it's likely to be a pared-down version.\n\nAll told, Musk has said Tesla could have a few rough quarters, and the removal of the EV tax credit is significant, and Tesla's Model Y refresh, at least on initial view, doesn't look like it's enough to turn sales around. On the other hand, Tesla will face easier sales comparisons for the Y next year, as the affordable Model Y is set to go on sale and interest rates might be lower.\n\nThere are a range of possibilities, but not all of them are negative. Perhaps the safest conclusion is that Tesla will still dominate the U.S. market (current EV market share in the mid 40% range). Still, its operating profit margin will remain under pressure (currently just 4.1% in the second quarter) as affordable models are likely to come with lower margins.\n\nRobotaxis and unsupervised full self-driving are the key\n\nOn the recent earnings call, Musk stated, \"I think we will probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year.\" And in the earnings release, the company noted \"Our purpose-built Robotaxi product -- Cybercab ... is scheduled for volume production starting in 2026.\"\n\nA snapshot of Tesla in a year could show the following:\n\nA massively expanded robotaxi service, which in turn encourages sales of its FSD software and sales of Tesla vehicles (as buyers warm to the idea of potentially transforming their cars into robotaxis).\n\nTesla gearing up for the production of its dedicated robotaxi product, Cybercab, in 2026.\n\nTesla in a year\n\nA negative snapshot sees ongoing sales declines due to an aging lineup of cars, notably the Model Y, and a slow robotaxi rollout, and ongoing delays for regulatory approval of unsupervised, fully autonomous ride sharing (in this case, Tesla's unsupervised FSD). Musk thinks unsupervised FSD will be available in \"certain geographies\" by the end of 2025, but the doubters will point out his track record of being overly optimistic.\n\nA more positive scenario sees Tesla's sales growing again, with unsupervised FSD approved in some areas, robotaxi rollouts spurring EV and FSD sales, and Cybercab production around the corner, while Wall Street analysts are scrambling to pencil in assumptions for a long stream of explosive growth from robotaxi revenue sharing.\n\nThe answer lies somewhere in between the two, with the long-term potential from robotaxis/FSD making Tesla an attractive stock for risk-tolerant investors.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:04:50.401686+00:00"}

The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo head Ganesh Venkataramanan and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.\n\nIt also comes at a crucial time for Tesla.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has pushed to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.\n\nTesla‚Äôs decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla‚Äôs AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to ‚Äúprocess truly vast amounts of video data.‚Äù He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company‚Äôs second-quarter earnings call.\n\nIn 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company‚Äôs market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla‚Äôs AI team would ‚Äúdouble down‚Äù on Dojo in the lead-up to Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi reveal, which happened in October.\n\nBut talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.‚Äù\n\nThe Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021. Venkataramanan presented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia‚Äôs GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor.\n\nSources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing.

As a tech company, Tesla is heavily invested in artificial intelligence and robotics, but Ritchie has a warning for investors. ‚ÄúIt is still too soon to bet on it at this valuation,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúespecially since most of Tesla‚Äôs developments are focused on autonomous driving, which still faces a lot of challenges including regulatory ones that could delay it for at least a couple of years.‚Äù\n\nCompared to other tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon, Tesla still has a higher P/E ratio, but this may be more due to its leadership as a car company.\n\nAs a car manufacturer, Tesla‚Äôs market cap of nearly $1 trillion dwarfs that of legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors. However, recent performance has raised concerns. In Q2 2025, Tesla‚Äôs vehicle deliveries dropped 13.5%, falling to 384,122 units compared to 443,956 in the same period last year. This decline has impacted earnings and shaken investor confidence in some markets.\n\nAdditionally, according to David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX, an automated trading platform, ‚Äú[Tesla hasn‚Äôt] yet proved that they can dominate the EV market.

It could also push some BESS operators out of the state‚Äôs market, they said. But analysts with Aurora Energy Research told Utility Dive it‚Äôs unlikely to result in dramatic operational changes.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe four-hour state of charge requirement was already unfavorable for BESS operators, but any negative impact from maintaining the status quo may be offset by less contentious revisions to the protocol, said Olivier Beaufils, Aurora head of U.S. Central.\n\nFor example, the commission shortened the duration requirement for resources in the ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service from two hours to one hour, broadening access for shorter-duration energy storage systems, he said.\n\nAs for the four-hour requirement for non-spin reserve resources, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a change there,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more that the evolution people were expecting is not going to happen anytime soon,‚Äù Beaufils said, adding, ‚ÄúI think ERCOT is being a bit conservative as to what deployment for non-spin means.‚Äù\n\nCapstone expects the commission to revisit the four-hour requirement and other duration changes of the revised protocol about a year after they take effect on Dec. 5, Chen and Patel wrote. Stakeholders that opposed the changes may seek further revisions before then and ERCOT itself may revisit them if they appear to impact grid reliability, the analysts added.\n\nThe Dec. 5 effective date coincides with the rollout of the Real-Time Co-optimization plus Batteries program, or RTC+B, a broader framework to optimize batteries‚Äô energy and ancillary services in real time.\n\nThough proponents expect the RTC+B framework to more efficiently manage battery dispatch and potentially create new value streams for BESS operators, at least two Texas operators voted against the four-hour state of charge requirement at an ERCOT committee meeting in May, Aurora associate Aditi Shetty said in an interview.\n\n‚ÄúTheir argument, in a nutshell, is that by keeping non-spin [state of charge] at four hours, you decrease the amount of energy storage resources available to respond during periods of system stress,‚Äù she said, referring to dissenters Engie and Jupiter Power. ‚ÄúEffectively, you are taking a chunk of available megawatts off the system.‚Äù\n\nAnother way to look at it is that ERCOT doles out non-spin reserve awards in five-minute intervals, so a four-hour requirement means a battery system would need to maintain 48 times the charge needed to perform during a single interval, Shetty said. The independent market monitor‚Äôs one-hour recommendation would require just 12 times the needed charge.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:05:18.661456+00:00"}

Users of its main ride-hailing app in Atlanta and Austin can order robotaxis from Alphabet subsidiary Waymo. It also struck a deal with electric carmaker Lucid Motors and autonomous driving company Nuro to put 20,000 Lucid vehicles, owned by Uber and running Nuro‚Äôs self-driving tech, on the road in the next six years.\n\nSpeaking on the company‚Äôs second-quarter earnings call Wednesday, Khosrowshahi raised Uber‚Äôs publicly stated ambitions. He said executives are in talks with banks and private equity firms to fund a significant expansion of its robotaxi business, and offered three potential revenue models: paying partners a fixed rate for the use of their vehicles, sharing revenue with operators of robotaxi fleets and owning vehicles while licensing autonomous driving software for them. ‚ÄúOnce we prove the revenue model, how much these cars can generate on a per-day basis, there will be plenty of financing to go around,‚Äù he said confidently. In the interim, Khosrowshahi has smaller plans:\n\nUber said it will dedicate a ‚Äúmodest‚Äù amount of its $7 billion in annual cash flows to fund robotaxi deployments, and could sell minority stakes in companies to finance further expansion. Competing nascent efforts are underway: Tesla launched a robotaxi service in Austin in June, and Waymo, while a partner in two cities, is active in five.\n\nUber posted a better-than-expected revenue increase of 18% in the second quarter on Wednesday and unveiled a $20 billion share buyback plan as it offered an upbeat outlook for the third quarter. Khosrowshahi cited a ‚Äúcontinued confidence in the business‚Äù when talking about the buyback, which also hints at why he‚Äôs willing to seek financing for the robotaxi expansion.\n\nReasonably Robotic: On the earnings call, Uber said there has been no dip in demand in cities where robotaxi services have launched. That‚Äôs among the many appealing factors of a potential expansion: another would be the prospect of better margins if the company relies on fewer human drivers.

Let's take a look at the stock price. It's up in the pre-market, up about just under 10% there after a 41% jump yesterday. A broader cannabis stock rally has been sparked by fresh hopes for US federal reform. Cannabis is fully legal in 24 states, but not at a federal level. Now, President Trump might change that. He said he's considering reclassifying marijuana within the next few weeks, potentially removing it from Schedule I, the category where it currently sits alongside heroin and LSD. That move could unlock tax deductions and open the door to new institutional investment. The legal cannabis market in the US alone is already worth more than $30 billion a year, and analysts see that number doubling within the next decade if federal barriers fall. Tilray's not alone. Canopy Growth, Aurora Cannabis, SNDL, and Cronos Group have all climbed in double digits. Okay, our second trending ticker today is Tesla. It's trading at about $341 in the pre-market after it climbed nearly 3% yesterday. Investors are digesting some significant updates from the Musk Empire. Yesterday, Elon Musk confirmed he's disbanded the Dojo supercomputer team and will pivot to in-house A15 and A16 chips. These chips are expected to power full self-driving Optimus robots and upcoming models like the Cybercab and the next-gen Roadster. Second, and this is very much a moving story today, Musk said his startup XAI was going to take legal action against Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of antitrust violations in managing App Store rankings, although he didn't provide evidence to support his claim. So, between AI strategy pivots and legal drama, keep an eye on the Tesla ticker today. And finally, we look at CoreWeave. The AI infrastructure firm is losing some steam in the pre-market ahead of its highly anticipated earnings report after the closing bell today. You can see it's down nearly around 3% after a very strong performance yesterday. It closed up nearly 8%. We're starting to see increasingly contrasting views on the stock. Bulls, including JP Morgan, remain confident that the growth narrative will hold with high expectations fueled by increased infrastructure spending by major players like Google and Microsoft. But, CoreWeave is a risky trade right now. The stock has seen wild swings and shed roughly a third of its value from its June peak, burdened by rising debt and concerns that the recent AI hype may have peaked. Some market watchers point out that CoreWeave may not be able to deliver on the growth prospects it sold, and the stock might see more big swings in the coming days as the lock-up prohibiting insiders from selling shares after the IPO expires in just two days time on August 14th.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:39.824852+00:00"}

Based on Tesla‚Äôs closing price of $339.03 on Aug. 11, 2025, the shares are currently worth about $32.5 billion.\n\nTo put that dollar amount into context, consider this: If you suddenly found yourself with $32.5 billion, you‚Äôd be the 60th-richest person in the world, according to the latest Forbes billionaire list.\n\nMusk himself remains the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $418.5 billion. But his lead is shrinking ‚Äî mainly because Tesla‚Äôs stock price has fallen by roughly one-quarter since closing at $426.50 on Jan. 17, 2025. On that date, the 96 million shares would have been worth $40.9 billion.\n\nBut weep not for Musk. A year ago, Tesla traded for around $201 a share, so its value has risen by nearly 69% since then.\n\nExplore More: I Asked ChatGPT: How Many Middle-Class Retirements Could You Fund With Elon Musk‚Äôs Wealth?\n\nTaking Stock of Musk‚Äôs Wealth\n\nMusk‚Äôs wealth is almost all connected to his holdings in Tesla, rocket producer SpaceX and artificial intelligence startup xAI. He owns about 12% of Tesla excluding options, according to Forbes. Tesla‚Äôs market cap is roughly $1 trillion, so a 12% stake would equal about $120 billion.\n\nAs Forbes noted, Musk‚Äôs legal situation with Tesla started in early 2024, when a Delaware judge voided Musk‚Äôs 2018 deal to receive options that equaled another 9% of the company. Pending Musk‚Äôs appeal, Forbes has discounted the options by 50%.\n\nTesla Takes a Few Hits\n\nTesla‚Äôs stock woes this year have their roots in both politics and business fundamentals.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:44.245784+00:00"}

Tesla is already there, but the company's EV lead is slipping.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/12/better-ev-stock-ford-vs-tesla/", "published_at": "2025-08-12T07:22:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Most automakers, including Ford, are trying to position themselves for an EV future. Tesla is already there, but the company's EV lead is slipping.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) industry holds a lot of promise, but it's also facing significant headwinds. Rising materials costs because of tariffs, an uncertain economy, and lackluster consumer demand are making it harder for EVs to be successful.\n\nBut during this time of transition, it's not a bad idea to consider which companies are leaders in the EV space and how their current dominance could boost their stock in the coming years, after market conditions improve.\n\nThat's why it's worth assessing the positions of Ford (F -0.22%) and Tesla (TSLA 2.85%) right now. Both are automotive powerhouses in their own right, but which is the better long-term EV stock? Let's have a look.\n\nThe EV advantage: Tesla\n\nIt's no surprise that Tesla has the EV advantage, considering the company started as an EV maker and didn't have to transition to the industry the same way Ford did. But it's important to note just how far ahead Tesla is as an EV leader, compared to Ford.\n\nOut of the top 10 best-selling EVs in the U.S. so far this year, three of them are Teslas -- the Cybertruck, the Model Y, and the Model 3 -- and the company takes the top two spots on the list. In total, it has sold an estimated 721,000 EVs in the U.S. in the first half of this year.\n\nFord has an impressive two models on the best-selling EV list: the Lightning pickup and the Mustang Mach-E. But where Tesla and Ford diverge is in how many EVs they sell, with Ford coming up woefully short at just 47,200 in the first seven months of this year. That amounts to Tesla selling more than 15 times the number of EVs Ford currently sells.\n\nI will add, though, that Tesla's sales are severely slumping. The company's vehicle deliveries are down 13% from the year-ago quarter. It's still on top, but it clearly has its work cut out for it if it wants to stay there. Ford, for its part, is experiencing a slowdown, too, with EV sales down 10%.\n\nThe long-term innovation advantage: Tesla\n\nTesla's brand is suffering right now, mostly in response to CEO Elon Musk's past involvement overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency and his polarizing political views, both of which have contributed to Musk being distracted from managing the company.\n\nDespite this, the company is looking to a future that involves far more than EVs. It says it is already producing 5,000 Optimus humanoid robots this year and has launched a limited robotaxi service that's part of Musk's broader vision for autonomous vehicles.\n\nBoth of these businesses are potentially lucrative but are still in their early form. For example, humanoid robotics will be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford is still trying to get a handle on EVs. CEO Jim Farley said recently that the company \"plans to design and build a breakthrough electric vehicle and platform in the U.S.\" next year.\n\nI give a lot of leeway to automakers right now as they try to figure out the best course of action in a difficult selling environment. But if I had to choose between buying the stock of a company that's already successful with EVs (and expanding into new, innovative markets) and an automaker that's still trying to figure out electric vehicles, I'm going to choose the former.\n\nVerdict: Tesla wins, but maybe hold off on buying just yet\n\nJust because one company is better than another at doing something -- in this case, making and selling EVs -- doesn't automatically make its stock a buy. Tesla has some serious hurdles to clear over the next few years, including ensuring Musk is laser-focused on managing the company, turning around EV sales, and (eventually?) launching a new vehicle model.\n\nSo, if you're bent on buying an EV stock and you're only deciding between Tesla and Ford, then I would certainly go with Tesla. But just know that the company's sales and earnings are on the decline right now, and it could take a while before things turn around.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:57.298881+00:00"}

Ultraviolette‚Äôs global expansion follows the 2024 launch of its F77 Mach 2 flagship model and its second product, the F77 SuperStreet, in February.\n\nBehind Ultraviolette are two childhood friends ‚Äî CEO Narayan Subramaniam and CTO Niraj Rajmohan ‚Äî who combined their expertise in mechanical engineering, automotive design, computer science, and electronics to electrify the mid-segment two-wheeler market.\n\nThe duo, which drew inspiration from Tesla, started Ultraviolette at a time when India‚Äôs electric two-wheeler market was dominated by low-speed models, mainly catering to commercial and utility needs. The early boom was driven by Chinese imports offering low-cost options, followed by a wave of homegrown startups and, more recently, legacy manufacturers entering the space.\n\nInstead of becoming just another player in that race, the Ultraviolette co-founders set out to build electric motorcycles that could match the performance of 150cc to 800cc internal combustion engine sports bikes.\n\n‚ÄúWe asked ourselves, if we have to make electric exciting in two-wheelers, what would it take? And that‚Äôs the objective with which we started,‚Äù said Rajmohan (pictured above, right) in an exclusive interview.\n\nThe Bengaluru-based startup took about four years from its inception in 2016 to unveil the first model in 2019. The startup went through multiple design iterations before finalizing the seventh version ‚Äî hence the name F77. The commercial version debuted with a fixed battery pack to deliver over 186 miles of range and a top speed of 96 miles/hour with a 30kW peak power and up to 100 newton-meters of torque.\n\nUltraviolette has also unveiled the lightweight Shock Wave motorcycle as well as the Tesseract scooter, which features front and rear radars and cameras to enable an assisted-driving experience and blindspot detection. The scooter costs ‚Çπ145,000 ($1,650), while its motorcycles (ex-showroom) have a base price of ‚Çπ175,000 ($2,000) and goes up to $10,000.\n\nUltraviolette F77 Mach 2 Image Credits:Ultraviolette\n\nUltraviolette‚Äôs vehicles come equipped with eSIM connectivity and feature predictive maintenance powered by a proprietary diagnostics system. Rajmohan said the system can detect even minor issues, such as when the chain needs lubrication. The startup offers an app that provides all these insights to consumers on the go.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:00.456576+00:00"}

The company arguably has the best vehicle technology in the U.S. EV industry, has been on a roll increasing deliveries each quarter, and just inked a potentially massive deal with Uber Technologies. So if Lucid has so much momentum, why is the stock down 30% in 2025?\n\nFrom the top ropes!\n\nOut of nowhere, the conversation around autonomous driving and robotaxi service isn't regarding Tesla or Waymo, but instead an often overlooked electric vehicle (EV) maker, Lucid. That's because a couple of weeks ago news broke that ride-hailing platform Uber Technologies would partner with Lucid to launch a robotaxi service later next year in a major U.S. city, combining integral parts from Nuro, Uber, and Lucid.\n\nUber is targeting to deploy 20,000 or more Lucid vehicles equipped with the Nuro Driver over six years with the first prototype already operating autonomously on a closed circuit at Nuro's Las Vegas track. Even better news is that Uber plans to put its money where its mouth is and is investing in Lucid.\n\n\"This investment from Uber further validates Lucid's fully redundant zonal architecture and highly capable platform as ideal for autonomous vehicles, and our industry-leading range and spacious well-appointed interiors, as ideal for ridesharing,\" Interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said in a press release. \"This is the start of our path to extend our innovation and technology leadership into this multi-trillion-dollar market.\"\n\nWhere art thou, momentum?\n\nThere's no question Lucid has momentum behind it with six consecutive quarters of record-breaking vehicle deliveries, culminating in the second quarter of 2025. Add in the fact that Lucid is just now accelerating production of the new Gravity SUV, and there are likely to be more record-breaking quarters in the future.\n\nSo with all this momentum in sales, and with a bright partnership with Uber and Nuro, why is Lucid down 30% in 2025? The problem is that Lucid has also been hit with a triple whammy of negative developments.\n\nFirst, the loss of regulatory credit sales is a big slap to all young EV makers. Essentially EV makers are given credits for producing zero-emission vehicles, whereas automakers producing vehicles that don't meet emissions standards were fined. At the time automakers that needed to offset their lineup of gasoline-powered vehicles simply purchased regulatory credits from EV makers to meet emissions standards. That was until the current administration took away penalties for missing standards, effectively removing any incentive to purchase regulatory credits from manufacturers such as Lucid.\n\nSecond, in the world's least kept secret, the $7,500 tax credit is disappearing officially on Sept. 30, which means every qualifying vehicle will be more expensive to purchase in the near term. This is expected to pull forward demand from consumers on the fence about purchasing into the third quarter, also leaving a demand lull in the fourth quarter -- so it's going to be a bumpy end to 2025. It also puts immense pressure on Lucid to accelerate production of the Gravity SUV as soon as possible to take advantage of the boost in third-quarter demand for EVs.\n\nThird, tariffs have been torturous for automakers that need years to carefully plan logistics, distribution, design, and production. It's commonplace for automakers to import parts to be assembled in America -- but these are still hit with tariffs, hurting companies such as Lucid. Tariffs have also caused some bottlenecks in rare earth materials needed for battery production.\n\nWhat it all means\n\nLucid has plenty of momentum, and its stock price doesn't seem to reflect that at the moment with slower-than-anticipated EV industry growth in the U.S. market. Lucid has plenty of obstacles in its path and is burning through cash rapidly, but it has the backing of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, an excellent product, and momentum going into the back half of 2025. Things should start looking up for Lucid investors.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:01.685224+00:00"}

What makes Tesla stock unique is its position at the intersection of long-term investing and short-term trading. Despite the stock's stomach-churning volatility, plenty of investors remain gung ho about Tesla's future.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nIn my view, it all comes down to one factor: confidence in Tesla's leadership -- particularly its eccentric CEO, Elon Musk.\n\nA few days ago, CNBC investment personality Jim Cramer shared perhaps the most controversial take on Tesla stock that I've heard in years.\n\nLet's break down Cramer's take and examine what he's really saying. Is now a smart time to invest in Tesla stock? Read on to find out.\n\nA Tesla take for the ages\n\nCramer is the host of a CNBC program called Mad Money in which he covers the economy, individual stocks, and broader market themes. On his show, he hosts a segment called \"Lightning Round,\" taking rapid-fire calls from retail investors who ask for advice about their portfolios.\n\nIn the clip below, you'll hear Cramer's response to a caller who asked if Tesla stock might rebound back to her original purchase price.\n\nJim Cramer last night on $TSLA: \"Tesla is morphing right now. It's in transition from being a car company to being a technology company. You wanna be in there because the tech is worth a lot more than what it's selling for right now. Don't care where you bought it, care where... pic.twitter.com/WzlPdQD7gq -- Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) August 5, 2025\n\nAlthough the video is brief, Cramer managed to share several important insights.\n\nInvesting in Tesla stock requires a genuine belief that the company is not a traditional automaker. While the biggest money maker for the company is the electric vehicle (EV) business, Musk has been sharing a vision of transitioning Tesla to a technology platform for years.\n\nWhile Cramer did not offer specifics to the caller, he suggests that Tesla's technology stack is the real reason to own the stock. More specifically, Tesla is pursuing artificial intelligence (AI) products across two primary end markets: robotics and self-driving vehicles.\n\nTesla's autonomous vehicle fleet, dubbed the robotaxi, has officially launched and has its sights on rival platforms from Alphabet's Waymo and Uber Technologies.\n\nIn addition, Musk has proclaimed that Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, could wind up being the largest segment of the company's ecosystem in the long run. While that might sound overzealous, which is quite apropos for Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has shared a similar sentiment, calling robotics a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.\n\nI believe that many investors view Tesla purely as a vehicle manufacturer and either discount or completely overlook the company's AI ambitions. Cramer lost me with his final thought to the caller, though.\n\nHere is where Cramer lost me\n\nInvestors should not try to time the market. Instead, you're better off adding to high-conviction positions for a long time -- buying the stock at various price points. This is an investment strategy commonly referred to as dollar-cost averaging.\n\nOne interpretation of Cramer's advice is that the caller shouldn't worry about the specific price she paid for Tesla stock because this could be just one entry point in a series of buys over the course of several years. The thing is, he didn't really say that.\n\nInstead, Cramer seems confident -- perhaps overly so -- that Tesla stock will rise from its current levels. This is where he (sort of) lost me.\n\nWhere is Tesla stock headed from here?\n\nOver the last five years, Tesla stock has risen by 222% as of this writing (Aug. 7). This absolutely trounces the returns of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, both of which gained roughly 90% over the same period.\n\nThe chart above benchmarks Tesla against its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers on the basis of forward price to earnings (P/E) over the past three years. Throughout the AI boom, Tesla's valuation multiples have consistently outpaced its peers' -- despite the company having little to actually show for its AI ambitions so far.\n\nMany of Tesla's peers have already launched, commercialized, and monetized AI-powered products and services. Meanwhile, Tesla is in the early innings of monetizing robotaxi and launching Optimus. For now, both of these projects remain fairly unproven revenue sources.\n\nThis is an important contrast because investors could argue that much of the upside from Tesla's AI pursuits is already priced into the stock.\n\nTaking this one step further, the analysis above features future earnings estimates. Even though Tesla has yet to generate meaningful profits from its most ambitious bets, the company still fetches a premium valuation multiple over its peers who already have strong footholds in AI.\n\nWhile trying to time the market is a mistake, I do think that price and valuation should matter to investors. If Musk successfully pulls off his AI vision, then Tesla stock could experience a parabolic run for the ages. The big variable here is that no one really knows when robotaxi and Optimus will reach a critical mass.\n\nWhile Tesla stock may rise in the long run, there's no knowing when. Ignoring valuation might work for a swing trade, but for long-term investors, understanding what is priced in -- and what's not -- is crucial. This is what makes Cramer's statement about price a little flawed, in my view.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:03.254420+00:00"}

However, over the past 12 months, the stock has rallied roughly 65%, supported by improving production metrics, pricing stability, and renewed enthusiasm for the company's growth story.\n\nFor many Tesla bulls, the real long-term catalyst remains the company's autonomous-driving technology. Advocates believe its progress in full self-driving capabilities could open up entirely new revenue streams and transform Tesla's earnings profile over the next decade.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:18.542227+00:00"}

CEO Elon Musk provided an update on the company's robotaxi fleet on Sunday, and new data could suggest that its electric vehicle (EV) sales trends are improving.\n\nA wider robotaxi release\n\nAccording to Barrons, Tesla recently reported longer wait times for its Model Y, rising from one to three weeks to a range of four to six weeks. It could signal that orders are picking up. The first two quarters of the year have shown significant year-over-year decline in EV sales, which is the company's core business for now.\n\nHowever, one reason for the increased wait time could be the elimination of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs that expires at the end of the third quarter.\n\nIn other news, Musk said on X on Sunday that Tesla's robotaxi business would have \"open access next month,\" meaning that customers would not need to be invited to use the service. He also said last Friday that the full self-driving technology on Model Y vehicles in Austin is roughly six months \"more advanced than what is available in cars in America and there are some additional breakthroughs in Tesla AI that will make the car feel eerily human.\"\n\nCurrently, the company is running a soft launch of robotaxis in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, where robotaxis are geofenced (limiting where they can go) and reportedly being monitored by humans remotely.\n\nProgress on robotaxis is good news\n\nAn improving EV business is good news, but given that investors have largely looked past Tesla's poor EV performance, I'm guessing that they are more excited about further progress on robotaxis, which is expected to be a massive new business for the company.

These are two of the largest, most closely watched names in the market, and right now they both appear to be on the verge of significant technical breakouts.\n\nOver the past few months, their paths have diverged. Tesla has been grinding through a year marked by choppy, and volatile price action, while Meta has marched steadily higher, leading the broad market. Despite these differences, both are now aligned in that they both have strong bullish catalysts, and their charts are flashing high-probability breakout signals.\n\nBelow, I‚Äôll break down what‚Äôs driving each stock, highlight the most relevant quantitative metrics, and walk you through the technical setups that could set the stage for the next big move.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla Stock on the Verge of a Comeback\n\nTesla has spent much of the past year navigating a storm of mixed investor sentiment, partly tied to shifting perceptions of its core EV business, partly to Elon Musk‚Äôs sometimes polarizing public presence, and partly to uncertainty over whether the company‚Äôs future lies more in cars or in ambitious side bets like humanoid robots. The result has been choppy, often volatile price action, with the stock barely gaining over the past twelve months even as the broader market has marched higher.\n\nThat said, Tesla is no stranger to long consolidation phases followed by explosive bull runs. Historically, the stock‚Äôs biggest rallies have come after extended periods of sideways action, and the current setup is starting to look like one of those moments. On Monday morning, shares broke decisively above a three-month consolidation range, a move that, if sustained, could mark the start of a significant bull run.\n\nFundamentally, two potential game-changers are on the horizon: the rollout of Tesla‚Äôs Optimus humanoid robot and the much-anticipated self-driving taxi business. Either could open entirely new revenue streams and spark renewed enthusiasm from investors, especially if early deployments impress.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that Tesla still carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating, reflecting near-term earnings estimate trends. However, technical action suggests the market‚Äôs tone toward the stock may be shifting. As long as shares hold above the breakout level around $338, the path of least resistance appears higher, with momentum traders likely to pile in.\n\nTradingView\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nShares of Meta Approach Another Record High\n\nMeta Platforms has enjoyed a remarkably smooth ride over the past year, steadily attracting buyers as both sales and profits continue to grow at an impressive pace.

The unusual arrangement is another example of a mega tech company acquiescing to the US administration‚Äôs demands, to gain an upper hand as trade relations are redrawn.\"\n\nFor the second quarter, Nvidia had previously guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2%.\n\nMetals One (MET1.L)\n\nLondon-listed minerals exploration company Metals One (MET1.L) emerged as the most-bought stock on Interactive Investor's July list, with shares up nearly 63% year-to-date.\n\nInteractive Investor's Hunt said: \"Somewhere towards the top of the risk spectrum are small exploration companies and one in particular has caught the eye of the most determined II customers\"\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nThe company currently has a market cap of ¬£34.63m and a share price of 7.08p, at the time of writing.\n\n\"Unknown in February when the shares traded at 2.4p, feverish speculation in May around a potential acquisition in Norway which would give the company access to gold, copper and nickel deposits, was followed by unsubstantiated claims from outside the company of a massive uranium find,\" said Hunter.\n\nDefence has remained a popular theme with investors, with FTSE 100-listed (^FTSE) Rolls-Royce (RR.L) appearing once more on Interactive Investor's most bought list.\n\nShares are up 91% year-to-date, lifting the company to a market cap of $90.8bn, though Hunter said this \"has not been enough to deter followers of the stock because of valuation concerns\".\n\nThe stock is now up 1069% on a five-year basis, with the most recent jump coming on the back of the company's half-year results, released in late July.\n\nRead more: Defence companies post strong results as UK investors back the sector over AI\n\nThe aero-engineer reported an underlying operating profit of ¬£1.76bn in the first half of the year, versus ¬£1.15bn a year ago. Underlying revenue of ¬£9.06bn was also up on the ¬£8.18bn Rolls-Royce reported in the first half of last year.\n\nHunter said that Rolls-Royce reported \"strong progress across each of its divisions. With flying hours on the increase and with no signs of defence spending wavering, the story may yet have further to run.\"\n\nPalantir (PLTR)\n\nCombining both the themes of defence and AI is data software company Palantir (PLTR), which was among the top-traded stocks on the Robinhood UK platform in July.\n\nRobinhood UK's Lane said that Palantir \"rallied to new all-time highs in July, with a $100m government contract making the headlines, along with news of a new product in the works, designed to plan, build and review applications on the Palantir platform.\"\n\nShares are up 141% year-to-date, with the stock having risen on the back of its second-quarter earnings, released in early August.\n\nPalantir posted earnings per share of $0.16 for the quarter, beating consensus estimates of $0.14 and up 77% from the same period last year. Revenue came in at $1.004bn, Palantir's first quarter surpassing the billion-dollar mark on a quarterly basis. The company's top line also beat analyst forecasts for $939.25bn and was up 48% year-over-year.\n\nMost popular funds in July\n\nAs buoyant sentiment drove markets higher last month, investors continued to put money into US and global passive funds in June, giving them exposure to some of the world's biggest companies, such as the \"Magnificent 7\" tech behemoths.\n\nSam Benstead, fixed income lead at Interactive Investor, said: \"Looking at passives, low-cost, global funds were popular in July‚Äôs top 10, including Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index and HSBC FTSE All-World Index. It‚Äôs always sensible to take a quick look at the country allocation in the fund factsheet before investing, so that you can get the right fit for your portfolio. For example, some global funds invest in developing markets and some don‚Äôt.\"\n\nThe active fund that appeared in both Interactive Investor and Hargreaves Lansdown's top 10 lists was Artemis Global Income (0P0000W36K.L).\n\nAccording to a fund update, published at the end of last month, the fund rose 11.7% in the second quarter, compared with gains of 5.0% from its MSCI AC World benchmark and 2.8% from its IA Global Equity Income sector average.\n\nThe biggest contributor to outperformance was the fund's some 20% exposure to aerospace and defence, which includes holdings in Germany's Rheinmetall (RHM.DE) and BAE Systems (BA.L).\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T14:13:18.821729+00:00"}

The jump in EV sales comes ahead of the federal EV tax credit expiration, with EV demand expected to be strong throughout the third quarter.\n\nCox Automotive's Kelly Blue Book estimates EV sales were robust in July, initially estimated to be the second-best month ever, with sales over 130,000 ‚Äî a 20% jump from a year ago. KBB's official tally for July will come next week.\n\nBut it wasn't just the tax credit expiration that drove buyers to EVs.

Tesla's July ATP was $52,949, down 2.4% compared to June and sliding 9.1% compared to a year ago. KBB said Tesla incentives in July were higher as well, leading to increased sales compared to June but down year over year. KBB said a higher mix of cheaper base Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs pushed overall ATPs lower for Tesla.\n\nRead more: How to avoid the sticker shock on Tesla car insurance\n\nFor the industry as a whole, the average incentive package for EVs hit 17.5% of ATP in July, which KBB said was a record in the modern era of EV sales, and up more than 40% compared to last year.\n\n\"The urgency created by the administration's decision to sunset government-backed, IRA-era EV incentives was expected to create serious demand for EVs in the short term,\" Cox Automotive senior analyst Stephanie Valdez Streaty said in a statement. \"At this pace, Q3 will be the best ever and then some, as buyers jump in before the big incentives dry up.\"\n\nAs for Tesla, the company's website shows Model Y wait times in the US stretching to four to six weeks, up from one to three weeks earlier this summer.

But Trump is essentially extorting certain companies to get things he wants from them. Clever CEOs are playing along, whether shareholders like it or not.\n\nExhibit A consists of Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which are basically buying export licenses from the Trump administration so they can sell semiconductors in China. Both companies have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from chip sales in China in exchange for the right to sell there.\n\n‚ÄúMy political head is spinning again with this new pay-to-play plan with Nvidia and AMD,‚Äù Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in an Aug. 11 analysis. ‚ÄúI pray for the sake of American free market capitalism that it stops here.\"\n\nThe Nvidia and AMD deals immediately bring to mind competitor Intel (INTC), which hasn‚Äôt yet agreed to cough up an export toll. Here‚Äôs a safe guess: It, too, will pay a similar fee for similar privileges.\n\nAt the moment, Intel is doing damage control. On Aug. 7, Trump directly attacked CEO Lip-Bu Tan, saying on social media that he ‚Äúmust resign, immediately.‚Äù Trump and some other Republicans seem to be concerned that Tan had improper connections with China‚Äôs military at another firm he ran until 2021.\n\nTan, a US citizen, now plans to meet with Trump to demonstrate his commitment to American interests, according to the Wall Street Journal. Fine. But that‚Äôs probably not what Trump is looking for. Trump has a feral instinct for detecting vulnerability in adversaries and using that leverage to extract measurable gains. He‚Äôll want something more tangible from Tan and Intel than reassurances. Trump‚Äôs favorite currency is money. Intel probably has no choice but to pay.\n\nNvidia‚Äôs 15% gratuity to the government for chip sales to China will cost the firm about $3 billion per year. The company‚Äôs stock dipped on the news, then drifted up. Investors may have first thought only of the bottom line, then decided the payment would be better than losing chip sales to China completely. The hit to AMD would be smaller because its China sales are lower. AMD stock also dipped then rose following the news. Intel stock rose on news of Tan‚Äôs chat with Trump, as buyers hope the company‚Äôs damage-control effort pays off.\n\nTrump has engineered this whole scenario. In April, Trump tightened restrictions on US chip sales to China, essentially blocking the sale of certain chips. Nvidia said that move would cost the company $5.5 billion in lost revenue. Then, in July, Trump reversed himself and decided to allow such chip sales to China.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T14:20:15.205938+00:00"}

In his post on X, Musk asked if Apple is quote \"playing politics\" by not highlighting his products. Apple and OpenAI have a partnership around AI built into the latest phones. Uh, Musk also has a long-running feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The Tesla CEO says X AI will take immediate legal action. Next up, AST SpaceMobile rising after the satellite company set out an ambitious plan to launch 45 to 60 satellites through this year into 2026. The company also said it received two additional early-stage contracts from the US government. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald see positive catalysts across liquidity, spectrum, and government opportunities. Scotiabank, though, cautious over the company's monetization model and global spectrum ambitions.
