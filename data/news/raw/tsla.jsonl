Until we get more clarity, here‚Äôs where things stand:\n\nEarnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve ‚Äî having resolved the inflation crisis ‚Äî shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nBut growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.\n\nActions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor‚Äôs perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nStocks are not the economy: There‚Äôs a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth ‚Äî in the cooling economy ‚Äî is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nMind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nInvesting is never a smooth ride: There‚Äôs also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nThink long-term: For now, there‚Äôs no reason to believe there‚Äôll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won‚Äôt be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it‚Äôs a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:35:34.987451+00:00"}

However, shares in machine vision expert Cognex (CGNX -1.01%), advanced materials company Hexcel (HXL -1.03%), and Tesla (TSLA 2.28%) all declined in the first half of 2025. On balance, all three are worth buying, as their issues appear to be near term, and their long-term investment cases remain excellent.\n\nCognex's machine vision\n\nIt's been a difficult few years for the leading machine vision company, as its main end markets suffered cyclical weakness. Let's put it this way: If you are an automotive company, consumer electronics, or logistics company, and seeing slowing end markets due to relatively high interest rates, then the first thing you will cut is capital spending on new product development and expanding production lines.\n\nThat's what happened with Cognex over the last couple of years, and it's easily seen in a chart of its revenue over an extended period.\n\nAnother thing you might notice is that, although Cognex's revenue does oscillate wildly, it does so about an upward trend line, and I think there's every reason to believe Cognex could get back to an aggressive growth phase in the near future.\n\nIt's not only that machine vision is an integral part of the fourth industrial revolution (the integration of the digital and physical worlds using the Internet of Things, and advanced data analytics), but it's also a technology whose relevance will increase with the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning.\n\nInstead of rules-based machine vision (such as monitoring a product assembly line for a known defect), AI-infused machine vision can learn from masses of data and examples fed into it, and even learn to recognize defects that product engineers didn't previously understand.\n\nWith the underlying growth in the adoption of machine vision (with AI as an additional driver) and a return to cyclical growth in its key end markets (automakers and consumer electronics can't avoid developing new products forever), Cognex is positioned to achieve management's aim of 10% to 11% annual organic growth through the cycle.\n\nHexcel's near-term challenges and long-term opportunities\n\nSelling advanced graphite composite materials to Boeing, Airbus, and their subcontractors presents a promising business opportunity, considering both companies' substantial backlogs of aircraft slated for delivery over the next decade (8,754 for Airbus, and over 5,900 for Boeing).\n\nIn addition, Hexcel also supplies materials for the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) market (it's partnering with Archer Aviation), also sells to Embraer, and as CEO Tom Gentile noted on the recent earnings call, \"the modern large cabin business jets now have extensive composite content, with ship set value between $200,000 and $500,000 per shipset.\"\n\nUnderpinning all of this is the positive trend in usage of composite materials, which increases with every new generation of aircraft, notably on wide-bodies such as the Airbus A350, which has a shipset of value of $4.5 million to $5 million for Hexcel.\n\nThe long-term outlook is excellent, but in the near term, Hexcel catches a cold when Airbus and Boeing start sneezing over supply chain issues that lower their production ramps.\n\nStill, it's undoubtedly a question of when, not if, the commercial aircraft production ramp gets back on track, and there are already some very positive signs that supply chain issues with engines are being overcome. As such, investing in Hexcel could set you up for life.\n\nDon't count out Tesla\n\nTesla's electric vehicle (EV) sales have declined this year, and CEO Elon Musk openly acknowledges the company could face a few rough quarters, not least due to the removal of EV tax credits. A combination of rivals releasing EVs and trying to establish market share, and ongoing relatively high interest rates, has pressured sales of Tesla's Model Y in particular.\n\nAt the same time, and on a more positive note, Tesla has begun its robotaxi rollout, and the key to the investment case for the stock is the potential growth in its robotaxi and unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) businesses. As previously discussed, it's not just the massive potential in the robotaxi business in itself; a successful rollout and the future release of unsupervised FSD to the public will add significant value to Tesla's EVs.\n\nAll the major automakers have either invested heavily in or explored robotaxis, and the reality is that Tesla remains best placed to succeed, provided it gets widespread regulatory approval. No other automaker has anything close to its market share in EVs in the U.S. It's far from clear when, and if ever, rivals like Alphabet's Waymo will be profitable, and Tesla's fleet of vehicles continues to rack up vast amounts of data to help improve its FSD.\n\nAs the rollout expands, and Tesla potentially deals with its flagging Model Y sales by releasing an affordable Model Y as planned in the fourth quarter, its stock price can appreciate through 2025. However, be aware that any significant issue with the rollout is likely to hurt the stock. Tesla is risky, but the risk comes with a potential reward in this case.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:35:37.870801+00:00"}

Each year, the firm releases a new edition of its \"Big Ideas\" report, and the 2025 version outlines how autonomous vehicles could turn ride-hailing into a $10 trillion industry over the long term. Ark predicts these cars will dramatically reduce the cost per mile of transportation, leading to widespread adoption around the world.\n\nTesla (TSLA 2.28%) is one of the leading developers of self-driving cars, and it recently launched an autonomous (but supervised) ride-hailing service in the U.S. as a test run for its upcoming Cybercab robotaxi. However, Tesla might not be the biggest winner of the autonomous revolution in the long run.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER -3.30%) operates the world's largest ride-hailing network, and it has all of the infrastructure in place to accommodate the shift toward self-driving vehicles. In fact, some of the biggest developers are choosing Uber's platform to commercialize their autonomous technologies.\n\nUber stock trades at a far more attractive valuation than Tesla stock right now, so here's why it could be a great buy as the self-driving revolution gathers steam.\n\nUber's network is unrivaled\n\nDeveloping the world's best autonomous vehicle isn't Tesla's biggest challenge. Building a ride-hailing network and successfully scaling it so consumers feel confident they can catch a ride anywhere, anytime is the hard part, especially since many other carmakers are likely to enter this race over the long term.\n\nUber has an incredible advantage in that department, because 180 million people use its platform every month for ride-hailing, food delivery, and commercial freight services. Therefore, even though Uber doesn't manufacture autonomous vehicles, it's quickly becoming the go-to destination for companies that do, because they want to access as many potential customers as possible.\n\nCEO Dara Khosrowshahi says Uber is already equipped with the necessary infrastructure to help companies deploy their autonomous vehicles, thanks to its 15 years of experience managing utilization in so many different cities. If a company deploys too many vehicles in a given location, Khosrowshahi says up to 95% of them could sit idle during quiet periods. If they don't deploy enough vehicles, they can't provide the timely service customers expect from ride-hailing platforms like Uber.\n\nThat is a huge challenge for newcomers like Tesla. Plus, Uber has processes in place to quickly handle fare disputes, insurance claims, and lost item returns (when customers accidentally leave valuables behind), which are small but highly necessary services.\n\nUber's list of autonomous partnerships continues to expand\n\nAutonomous driving could transform Uber's business from a financial perspective. During the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), its 8.8 million active drivers earned a combined $20.8 billion, which was the largest component of its $46.7 billion in gross bookings (the dollar amount customers spent on the platform). If Uber can eliminate that cost, a much larger chunk of its bookings will become revenue and profit.\n\nUber had partnerships with 20 different developers of autonomous vehicles at the end of Q2, which was up from 18 in the first quarter. One of those partners is Alphabet's Waymo, which is already completing over 250,000 paid autonomous trips every week in the U.S. through a combination of its own ride-hailing platform and Uber's.\n\nUber also welcomed China-based Baidu as a new partner in Q2. Its Apollo Go robotaxi service has completed over 11 million autonomous trips in total across Asia and the Middle East, which will supercharge Uber's presence in these high-growth markets.\n\nBy comparison, Tesla is way behind in the autonomous ride-hailing business. Its full self-driving software isn't approved for unsupervised use anywhere in the world right now, so the company still hasn't cleared the most basic hurdle. The autonomous ride-hailing service it launched in June uses passenger electric vehicles (EVs) like the Model Y and it requires full supervision, which means a human specialist is in the passenger seat at all times in case something goes wrong.\n\nUber stock looks far more attractive than Tesla stock\n\nUber stock might be a better investment than Tesla stock, not only because the company is in a more favorable position to capture the $10 trillion autonomous ride-hailing opportunity, but also because of its valuation.\n\nBased on Uber's trailing-12-month revenue of $47.3 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.2, making it far cheaper than Tesla stock, which trades at a P/S ratio of 12.4:\n\nUber's profits are also growing significantly, while Tesla's are currently shrinking due to several consecutive quarters of struggling EV sales.

The cohort consists of:\n\nNvidia NVDA 1.05% ) Microsoft MSFT 0.22% ) Apple AAPL 4.24% ) Amazon AMZN -0.23% ) Alphabet GOOG 2.44% ) GOOGL 2.48% ) Meta Platforms META 0.92% ) Tesla TSLA 2.28% )\n\nAll of these companies (except for Nvidia) have reported results, and investors may be curious as to which ones look like solid buys. I think all of these stocks are growing more interesting each day, but of the seven, I think five are a buy and two are to be watched.\n\nI'm keeping an eye on Apple and Tesla\n\nOver the past few years, many of these companies have delivered explosive revenue growth, except for Apple. Apple's growth finally returned in Q3 FY 2025, delivering double-digit growth (if you round up) for the first time since early 2022.\n\nStill, there are some questions about being behind in the AI arms race and what Apple's next big product is. I'm not ready to declare Apple a buy yet, but it's growing more intriguing with each quarter.\n\nTesla is in the worst shape of any Magnificent Seven company, with revenue falling 16% year over year in Q2. Additionally, with EV and regulatory credits getting eliminated, significant headwinds are popping up. However, Tesla's business has never been solely about EVs; otherwise, its valuation wouldn't make sense. An investment in Tesla is a bet that its humanoid robots, AI, self-driving, and rob-taxis will all be successes eventually. But for right now, I'm comfortable waiting on Tesla's situation to improve.\n\nI'm a buyer of the remaining five\n\nThe other five members of the Magnificent Seven all look promising to me, as they're all experiencing strong growth.\n\nMeta Platforms delivered a shocking Q2 report that delivered 22% revenue growth despite only guiding for 13% growth. That strength is expected to continue through Q3, with 20% revenue growth expected.\n\nMeta's advertising business is second to none, and the improvements it's making with AI to aid in ad creation and engagement are starting to pay off.\n\nAlphabet similarly had a strong advertising quarter, despite many investors being worried about Google Search potentially being left behind by generative AI. Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year, showcasing its strength and silencing doubters about its longevity.\n\nCompanywide, Alphabet's revenue rose 14% year over year, with diluted earnings per share rising 22%. That's an impressive result from a company that is supposed to be struggling. Additionally, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading for 20 times forward earnings.\n\nAll of this combines to make Alphabet one of the best stocks to buy right now.\n\nDespite Microsoft being the second-largest company in the world, it delivered monster growth in Q4 FY 2025 (ended June 30). Revenue was up 18% year over year, but the biggest shock in its report was Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing product and is a leading platform for building AI models. Azure's revenue was up a jaw-dropping 39% this quarter, showcasing strong demand for computing power.\n\nThis tailwind will persist for some time, making Microsoft an excellent stock to scoop up now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN -0.23%) investors had a negative reaction to its report, which caused shares to sink following earnings. However, I don't think they were as bad as the market thought, and the long-term outlook is still positive for the company.\n\nAmazon's profit growth continues to outpace revenue growth thanks to the strength of high-margin businesses like advertising and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAs long as this trend continues, Amazon will be a strong long-term pick. With both advertising and AWS being Amazon's fastest-growing segments by far, this trend looks primed to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nLast is Nvidia, which hasn't reported earnings yet. However, all of the companies involved in building out AI infrastructure on this list stated that their capital expenditures will be rising next year due to increased data center spend. This bodes well for Nvidia, as it receives a huge chunk of this spend. Additionally, Nvidia has reapplied for its export license to begin shipping H20 chips to China again, which will provide another growth tailwind for its business.\n\nI expect Nvidia to report blowout earnings on Aug. 27, making the stock a smart stock to scoop up before then. Nvidia may be the world's largest company, but I expect it to get even bigger with increased AI buildout.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:35:47.502720+00:00"}

Many people are waiting for the new version, and it could help Tesla sell more cars. Also, Tesla is working hard on self-driving technology, and the planned robotaxi is expected to be a big step forward. If that project does well, it could open up a new area of business for Tesla. Wedbush also said that the current political climate under a Trump administration could make things easier for Tesla when it comes to rules and regulations.

Between the new cars, the robotaxi, and support from the government, the company could keep growing. With a stock price much lower than the $500 target, some investors may see this as a good opportunity.\n\nTesla is a battery technology company because it designs and manufactures advanced lithium-ion battery cells, energy storage products like Powerwall and Megapack, and integrates these technologies into its electric vehicles and energy grid solutions, driving innovation in sustainable energy storage and usage.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

While Ark's portfolio boasts positions in many members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" one particular artificial intelligence (AI) darling seems to have caught Wood's eye as of late.\n\nAccording to recently published trading activity, Ark Invest has been scooping up shares of Tesla (TSLA 2.28%) like there's no tomorrow.\n\nLet's explore Wood's recent buying activity and assess what might have inspired her to double down on Tesla over the last few weeks.\n\nTaking a look at Wood's recent buying activity\n\nUnlike many of her peers in the wealth management space, Wood distributes summaries at the end of each trading session which itemize all of the stocks that Ark bought and sold on that day.\n\nIn the table below, I've summarized Ark's recent activity around Tesla stock.\n\nDate Shares Bought July 11 59,705 July 15 115,380 July 24 143,190\n\nOver the last few weeks, Wood added 318,275 shares of Tesla which were spread across the Ark Innovation, Ark Next Generation Internet, and Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhy might Wood like Tesla stock right now?\n\nTesla is primarily known for its electric vehicles and energy storage solutions. But over the last few years, CEO Elon Musk has been making grand promises that Tesla is going to disrupt the AI realm in epic fashion.\n\nOne of the ways Tesla plans to make a splash in the AI landscape is through its innovations in autonomous driving. The company is introducing self-driving vehicles to the Tesla ecosystem by offering the technology as a service -- primarily within Tesla vehicles purchased by consumers, as well as through the creation of a robotaxi fleet.\n\nWood has been bullish on Tesla's AI pursuits for years, especially the robotaxi business. In fact, Ark's long-run price target of $2,600 per Tesla share relies heavily on optimistic assumptions surrounding the company's ability to scale the robotaxi operation.\n\nWhile Tesla's robotaxi business is still comparatively smaller than Alphabet's Waymo and faces increased competition from the likes of Uber Technologies and its various partnerships, Musk appears undeterred.\n\nDuring Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, Musk proclaimed, \"I think we will probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year.\"\n\nMusk's statement is equal parts bold and speculative -- attributes that are congruent with Wood's growth investing strategy. At the end of the day, I don't think Wood is privy to anything meaningful that the rest of Wall Street isn't, though.\n\nInvestors like Wood tend to view Tesla through a long-run lens. In other words, some growth investors are not pricing Tesla for what the company is today, but rather they are assessing what the price could become if Musk pulls off his AI vision. While I understand how tempting it can be to follow hype and momentum, valuing narratives is essentially impossible.\n\nI think that Wood is optimistic that the robotaxi business will scale meaningfully during the second half of 2025, finally bearing fruit for Tesla as the company shifts from a traditional automaker to a technology business.\n\nIs Tesla stock a buy right now?\n\nValuing Tesla stock is an arduous exercise. On the one hand, the company does not fit neatly into the traditional automaker category alongside companies such as Ford Motor Company and General Motors. But on the other hand, Tesla is not purely a technology business much like Apple, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, or Amazon. Rather, Tesla sits at the intersection of car manufacturing, energy storage, AI, robotics, and software.\n\nIn the chart above, investors can see how Tesla stock tends to trade on narratives well beyond traditional valuation fundamentals. These dynamics can be seen clearly by the company's expanding price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple despite decelerating profitability across the business.\n\nWhile I'm optimistic about Tesla's robotaxi business in the long run, I do question Musk's aggressive timeline of serving half the U.S. population by year end. Beyond variables such as regulatory approvals needed across the country, Musk does have a reputation for missing deadlines. Candidly, I don't think the robotaxi rollout will be any different.\n\nFor now, I'd monitor Tesla as it scales the robotaxi business. It will take time before AI begins to move the needle for the company from a financial perspective, anyway. For these reasons, I think investors will have ample opportunity -- and probably more reasonable valuation levels -- to buy Tesla stock in the long run.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:35:56.839009+00:00"}

Between allegations Tesla isn't paying its bills and hurting small businesses, to facing consumer backlash from CEO Elon Musk's political tour (and we can't forget the sliding sales and global profits), it's been a full downpour. Let's consider the recent speed bumps, as well as Musk being rewarded with a hefty $29 billion payday.\n\nThe overseas spiral\n\nJuly figures are seeping in from Europe, and they show that Tesla registrations checked in 41.6% lower compared to the prior year, despite sales of electric vehicles (EVs) surging across the Continent.\n\nIt's a continuation of the sales spiral the EV maker faced during the first half of 2025. And the problem is that the decline was supposedly due to the new Model Y being in limited supply -- but the issues appear to be deeper than that.\n\nThe story is similar in China, another crucial market for Tesla. Its sales of China-made EVs dropped 8.4% in July compared to the prior year. That was a reversal from the small gain Tesla posted in June, which at the time reversed an eight-month losing streak.\n\nThe consumer backlash\n\nThe consumer displeasure is real, and Musk's political allegiances have pushed some buyers to new and different brands. There's evidence of the effect this is having on Tesla's once-spotless brand image, according to new data from S&P Global Mobility, which tracks sales data across the automotive industry.\n\nThe new data, shared with Reuters, showed that Tesla's consumer loyalty took a nosedive in July 2024, correlating with Musk's public commitment to an anti-environmental political campaign. According to Reuters, Tesla's loyalty peaked at 73% in June 2024 before bottoming out in March at 49.9%. No matter how you slice it, that's a quick and dramatic decline in consumer sentiment, literally driving buyers to another brand.\n\nA massive payday\n\nTesla's board granted Musk 96 million shares, worth roughly $29 billion, in an attempt to keep the billionaire focused on the EV company amid his multiple businesses and ventures. The vote comes after a 2024 Delaware court ruling that voided Musk's 2018 compensation package, which was valued at over $50 billion. The court said the approval process was flawed and unfair to shareholders.\n\nAccording to Automotive News, the special committee that was formed to consider the new pay package said: \"While we recognize Elon's business ventures, interests and other potential demands on his time and attention are extensive and wide-ranging ... we are confident that this award will incentivize Elon to remain at Tesla.\"\n\nWhat it all means\n\nTesla and its investors certainly appear to be at a crossroads. While selling EVs and zero-emission credits keeps the lights on for the young company, it constantly reminds investors that its future may be more in line with artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and robotaxi services. Long-term investors should stay the course but should also prepare for a bumpy few quarters as the company works through its upcoming identity crisis, the slow ramp-up of the robotaxi, and an aging lineup.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:36:00.779920+00:00"}

However, the company has seemingly taken a step back in the past few years as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has boosted the value of many other big tech companies.\n\nIn the past three years, Apple's stock is only up around 30%, making it the second-worst performer of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks (trailing only Tesla) and underperforming the S&P 500. That's not something investors are used to seeing from Apple.\n\nDespite Apple seemingly lagging behind, there could possibly be a breath of fresh air coming to the company, sparking new life into the stock.\n\nA much-needed rebound for the iPhone and Mac products\n\nApple's fiscal third-quarter earnings, for the period ended June 28, were a pleasant surprise for many people. Its revenue grew nearly 10% year over year to $94 billion, which is a June quarter record for the iPhone maker. And speaking of iPhone, the smartphone's revenue grew 13% year over year to $44.6 billion, which Apple noted was driven by the popularity of the iPhone 16 family.\n\nMac (which includes products like MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, and Mac Studio) revenue grew 15% year over year to $8 billion, but iPad and wearables, home, and accessories sales were noticeably down -- 8% and 9% year over year, respectively.\n\nStill, Apple's hardware revenue grew by 8% year over year and accounted for nearly 71% of its total revenue for the quarter. Apple's services segment reached an all-time high, bringing in $27.4 billion, but hardware remains -- and will likely remain -- king for the company.\n\nApple's year-over-year revenue growth was its highest in the past three years.\n\nIs Apple finally getting serious about AI?\n\nThe big cloud hanging over Apple's business has been AI (what it calls \"Apple Intelligence\"), and the lack of urgency in the space compared to rivals like Alphabet and Microsoft. It seems Apple is beginning to take it more seriously and address this issue.\n\nA major advantage on Apple's side is the number of devices it has in people's pockets, homes, and offices. Ideally, Apple can integrate AI into its various hardware, giving people even more of a reason to choose it over competitors. This has been the plan for a while, but it hasn't gone as smoothly or as quickly as most people thought or hoped.\n\nThat should change soon, with Apple's management noting on its latest earnings call that Apple is \"increasing [its] investment significantly in AI,\" both in infrastructure and company personnel. In its latest quarter, Apple spent nearly $3.5 billion on capital expenditures, its most since its fiscal quarter that ended in January 2023.\n\nApple has always moved cautiously and with intention. These new AI investment developments don't strike me as the company just now coming to its senses, but more so Apple feeling like now is the right time (a lagging stock price sure helps it come to that realization).\n\nApple's stock looks like a good entry point for investors\n\nAt the time of this writing, Apple is trading at 29 times its projected earnings for the next year. That's the second-lowest out of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks and below the 35 it was at to start this year.\n\nThat alone doesn't make Apple a buy right now, but it does give it a lot more upside now than before. This is especially true if its new AI prioritization plays out as management envisions. With $133 billion in cash and marketable securities to its name, Apple has all the resources it needs to ensure it keeps pace in the AI race.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:36:03.995184+00:00"}

Using the average charging cost of 4.56 cents per mile and typical monthly driving of 1,100 miles, this calculates to approximately $50 per month for home charging. For comparison, charging exclusively at home could increase your electric bill by $50-$100 monthly, according to GOBankingRates.\n\nExplore More: I Sold My Tesla ‚Äî Here‚Äôs How Much I Got for It and What I‚Äôm Driving Instead\n\nSubaru Forester Monthly Gas Costs\n\nThe 2025 Subaru Forester achieves 29 MPG combined (26 city in the city, 33 on highway), according to Edmunds. Using current national gas prices of approximately $3.20 per gallon and typical monthly driving of 1,100 miles, this calculates to about $122 per month in fuel costs for Forester owners.\n\nThe Cost Comparison\n\nBased on these calculations, Tesla owners spend roughly $50 monthly on electricity, while Forester drivers pay about $122 for gas. This represents potential monthly savings of approximately $72 when choosing Tesla over the Subaru Forester.\n\nOver a year, Tesla drivers could save around $864 compared to Forester owners, assuming consistent home charging for Tesla and regular gas prices for the Forester.\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nHowever, the comparison isn‚Äôt purely about fuel costs. Charging at Tesla Supercharger stations costs about 25 cents per kWh, meaning a full recharge to 250 miles would cost about $22, which is more expensive than home charging but still competitive with gas prices.\n\nTesla‚Äôs lower operating costs extend beyond fuel savings, including reduced maintenance requirements compared to traditional gas engines. Meanwhile, the Forester offers advantages like lower upfront costs, established service networks, and no range anxiety.\n\nFor budget-conscious drivers prioritizing monthly fuel expenses, Tesla provides significant savings over the Subaru Forester based on these calculations, making electric vehicle ownership increasingly attractive from a purely operational cost perspective.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much To Charge a Tesla Monthly vs. Gas for a Subaru Forester", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:36:08.372625+00:00"}

Its chips can be found in popular consumer products like Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox, and even the infotainment systems inside Tesla's electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, AMD's biggest opportunity right now is in the data center. The company is planning to launch a new lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI development in 2026, which could blow the competition -- including Nvidia (NVDA 1.05%) -- out of the water.\n\nAMD stock is up 34% in 2025 already, but it's still below its all-time high just north of $200, which was set last year. Should investors scoop it up while it's still trading at a discount? Read on to find out.\n\nAMD is catching up to Nvidia in the data center space\n\nAMD launched its flagship MI300X data center GPU at the end of 2023, more than a year after Nvidia's industry-leading H100 GPU hit the market. Despite being behind, AMD still managed to attract some of Nvidia's largest customers, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms.\n\nWhile Nvidia continues to leap ahead of the competition with new GPU architectures like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, AMD is quickly closing the gap. It just started shipping its MI350 series GPUs, which are based on a new architecture the company calls Compute DNA (CDNA) 4. These new chips offer 35 times more performance than CDNA 3 versions like the original MI300X, placing them on par with Nvidia's Blackwell lineup.\n\nIn fact, the latest MI355 offers comparable performance to Nvidia's Blackwell GB200 GPU, and it delivers up to 40% more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) in AI inference workloads for the same cost. In other words, it's much cheaper to run over the long term without sacrificing any processing power, which is why it's attracting hyperscalers and even leading AI start-ups like OpenAI.\n\nBut customers' attention is already turning to 2026, when AMD plans to release its MI400 series. These new chips will be combined with specialized software and hardware systems to create a fully integrated AI data center rack called Helios, which will supercharge their performance. AMD CEO Lisa Su believes these MI400-based Helios systems will be the most powerful in the world when they launch, offering a staggering 10 times more performance over the MI350 series.\n\nSimply put, 2026 could be the year that AMD overtakes Nvidia in the AI data center space, at least in terms of technological capability.\n\nAMD's AI data center revenue hit a speed bump in Q2\n\nAMD generated a record $7.7 billion in total revenue during the second quarter of 2025, which was a 32% increase from the year-ago period. The data center segment was responsible for $3.2 billion of that revenue on its own, but it only mustered 14% growth, which was somewhat disappointing given the competitive, high-stakes nature of the GPU market.\n\nExport restrictions were recently imposed by the U.S. government, and they wiped out AMD's AI GPU sales to China, which was the main reason for the underperformance in its data center segment. However, the company says it has applied for licenses to resume sales, and they are currently under review by the Trump administration.\n\nBut there was great news in other areas of AMD's business, like its client segment, where revenue soared 67% year over year to $2.5 billion. This is where the company accounts for sales of its Ryzen AI chips for personal computers, which come with a built-in GPU, central processing unit (CPU), and neural processing unit (NPU). They are installed in a growing number of computers from leading brands like Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus.\n\nAMD's gaming business also roared back to life in Q2, with revenue surging by 73% to $1.1 billion. Revenue declined in this segment last year, and also during the first quarter of 2025, but demand for some of the company's core products is starting to rebound. Console manufacturers are increasing their inventories in preparation for the holiday season, and AMD said demand for its new Radeon 9000 series desktop GPUs is exceeding supply.\n\nShould you buy AMD stock while it's under $200?\n\nDespite the temporary regulatory headwind in AMD's data center business, Lisa Su is as optimistic as ever about its potential. She believes the company's AI revenue will scale into the tens of billions of dollars per year over the long term, driven by the MI400 GPU, which is already experiencing strong customer interest even though it won't hit the market until next year.\n\nOn that note, is AMD stock a buy while it's still below its record high? The company generated $3.45 in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) over the last four quarters, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46.8. That means it's notably cheaper than Nvidia stock, which is sitting at a P/E ratio of 55.7.\n\nMoreover, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests AMD could deliver $5.97 in EPS during 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 27.1. That leaves room for significant upside, because the stock would have to soar by 73% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 46.8.\n\nIt's possible AMD stock will perform even better if the MI400 series blows the competition out of the water next year, like Su expects, so it could be a great addition to any diversified portfolio right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T10:36:10.121814+00:00"}

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Matt Frankel. I'm joined by my fellow longtime analyst Jon Quast, as well as the Motley Fools co founder and CEO Tom Gardner. Later in the show, we're going to be joined by fool.com analyst Jonathan Wilder. Today we're going to look at some recent earnings from Tesla, Chipotle, Alphabet, service now in IBM, and a little bit later, we are going to look at the Figma IPO that is coming up real soon. First, we're going to put Tesla's results under the microscope. It wasn't a big surprise, but Tesla reported a really weak second quarter. Automotive revenue was down 16% every year. The company has been losing EV market share to traditional automakers like GM. Some will say that Tesla's long term thesis is about a whole lot more than vehicle sales. Jon, what are your thoughts on this?\n\nJon Quast: Look Matt, I think if you're buying Tesla's stock today, you're not buying for the next year, you are looking for the next decade. Look, the report, it's shocking to see its primary revenue generator. Cars have a 16% drop. For any other company, this would be all out panic, but a lot of people say this is just vehicle sales for Tesla. First and foremost of those would be CEO Elon Musk. He says, on the earning call, everything with this business comes down to one word and that's autonomy. The idea is this company will make far more money in the future with its self driving software, with its robot taxis, with its optimist robot. All that is autonomy and that's really the thesis that Tesla Bowles and the CEO Elon Musk have for the company.\n\nMatt Frankel: Direct question here. Do you think Tesla's a buy right now?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah. As you're looking at it, if you're thinking through this grid of autonomy, if you're thinking through the grid of cars, then there's trouble right now. If you're thinking through the grid of autonomy, you really just have to extend that viewpoint way out because this isn't going to happen right away. Musk said that he's eyeing robot taxis for half the US population by the end of this year. But keywords there include probably and pending approval. Spoiler alert I'm almost positive there won't be that much regulatory approval by the end of the year. When it comes to optimist robot, look, they're trying to scale that up, but they're still working on the prototype Number 3 this year and hoping to get that done before the end of the year. I think that you're looking not at 2025 when it comes to Tesla, you need to be thinking 2035 if you're buying into this concept of autonomy today.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, I'd like to get your opinion on this. One of the key quotes that stood out to me from the earnings release was from Elon Musk. He said, we could probably have a few rough quarters, specifically referencing tariffs and the EB tax credits expiring. There's a lot at play here. How do you see the next year or so playing out for Tesla?\n\nTom Gardner: Well, I think it's going to be a bad year by any normal standard for a great growth company. This is not going to be a good year, but Elon Musk and Tesla. Tesla is a lot more than Elon Musk. I'm not meaning to diminish the huge impact he has on the business, but this is a massive company now and we have to understand that the really great companies aren't thinking about the next year. Jeff Bezos talked about this all the time at Amazon. Sometimes as analysts, we get really focused on what does this quarter look like? What's happening with the next 12 months for this business? But great business leaders are really looking forward much farther than that, we have to remember that in the backdrop for Tesla, they have $30 billion cash in net cash on their balance sheet. They have so much more capital, such a stronger balance sheet than anyone in automobiles. Musk's bet here, Tesla's bet is that we are moving to autonomy. It might take longer, there might be some issues in regulatory process on autonomous driving, but robot taxis are live and awesome. We see it with Waymo. We see a lot of high customer satisfaction, willingness to pay more. Obviously, there's not tipping going on, so you can pay a little extra, but it's going to be a premium feature. The last thing I'll say in my belief that Tesla will beat the market over the next five years.\n\nI do actually agree and have for a long time with what Musk said on the earnings call which is that he thinks Tesla will be the largest company in the world if autonomy plays out. I don't think that there's much question as whether it's going to play out. We'll see whether he's right about what will happen with Tesla. But remember, in the backdrop the idea is to have a million optimist robots in less than five years. There is, as Jon says, a lot that you're holding onto in belief. Let's see if this really plays out. I will say in hidden gems we've been an island because we're the only thing in the Motley Fool recommending the stock since 2012 with over 60 recommendations. The first one at about $2 a share. It's played out very well for us, but you cannot own the stock if a 30-50% decline in the price of the shares is going to knock you out because there's just no way you're going to avoid that. This stock will be down 40-60% multiple times. Every two or three years, you should expect a 30-40% decline in stock, in my opinion, and those have been and I believe will continue to be great opportunities to add.\n\nMatt Frankel: Let's pivot to Chipotle's earnings real quick. Unlike Tesla, investors are not that excited about what happened. They gave investors a not so pleasant surprise. They lowered their same store sales guidance for the year, same store traffic declined by 5% year over year. Tom, I know you follow Chipotle pretty closely as well. Is the week's second quarter something investors should really be worried about?\n\nTom Gardner: Not the quarter in itself, Matt, as we discussed with long term thinking for a business like Tesla. However, I'm on the record and my conviction is that, for example, Starbucks will be a better stock over the next five years than Chipotle. Part of that is just straight up Brian Nichol, the CEO who left Chipotle and is now at Starbucks. Is Brian Nichol closer to Michael Jordan, hoops fans know that Chicago Bulls won six NBA championships in eight years. Then when Jordan left in 1998 they have never been back into the championship series again. Sometimes you have an extraordinary leader and I think that is the case with Brian Nichol. My fear for Chipotle is that they're going to lose premium positioning now. We see flattening out same store sales growth. Restaurant margins in decline and obviously in this economic environment, which I think will persist because of a lot of the changes in the technology landscape and what will happen with employment, consumers are looking for discounts and getting lower priced protein in the form of chicken. Chipotle has has a billion and a half in cash flow. This is not a company in trouble at all. My fear is that it will become more of an operating company now rather than a vision driven business. That makes me think that this will be at best a market performer here over the next five years. As I said, I think Starbucks will outperform Chipotle with Brian Nichol as Starbucks a CEO.\n\nMatt Frankel: It's really important to put the quarter into context. Jon, just to name a few things. We got the initial tariff announcements at the start of the second quarter, stocks briefly plunged into a bear market. Consumers started becoming really cautious about discretionary spending, especially when that was going on. What are your thoughts on Chipotle as we head into the second half of the year?\n\nJon Quast: Look Matt, this is anecdotal, but I don't know personally, a single person who saw a tariff announcement on the news and said, Honey, maybe we should skip our Chipotle order this week. I would say that Chipotle is getting more pushback from other things. As Tom mentioned a minute ago, perhaps there's even a perception on value and portion sizes. This did actually come up last year with the company and they had to address it head on. It takes time to change a consumer perception of the business, whether it's real or it's just perceived, it takes time. I think we're still seeing that play out with the traffic being down, they didn't take any pricing. They've been taking pricing in recent years and getting to this point where I think consumers are reaching their limit. That is playing against them right now. I think that is what's happening rather than tariffs being something that are influencing consumers.\n\nLook I think that long term, I also agree with Tom that I think this is a company that is still fantastic operationally. Even with a rough quarter, you're looking at 18% operating profit margins. I know restaurants that would be happy with half of that. Long term, I think this still a company with a lot of promise, it's going to add many new restaurants in coming years. It's going to generate a lot of cash flow. I would agree though, is this going to become more of an operating thing? I'm not really sure that the unit economics are going to recover fully this year. It's going to take time to win back some consumers that have been lost.\n\nMatt Frankel: Next up, we're going to take a look at Alphabet's quarter, and it was a strong one. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nMALE_1: Does it ever feel like you're a marketing professional just speaking into the void?

Terms and conditions apply.\n\nMatt Frankel: Another one that just reported. Alphabet just reported really impressive results throughout its business. This is the Google parent company, of course. Google Cloud revenue was an extremely strong point with 32% revenue growth. That was an acceleration in the second quarter. Really, one of the biggest takeaways that I got from the report is that the AI investments they're making seem to be working, and management now expects to spend $85 billion in CapEx this year, primarily on building data centers and AI infrastructure up from the previous estimate of 75 billion. I'd love to get the thoughts from both of you but Jon, we'll start with you. What are your thoughts on the quarter and this aggressive AI investment strategy?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah, we human beings are so bad when it comes to big numbers like this. You said it just so casually and so many people are. But let's stop for a second. They raised their capital expenditure guidance by $10 billion. With this money you could buy Campbell Soup Company, 150-year-old business with products in every store across the United States. They could buy Huntington Engles. This is one of the only companies capable of building a nuclear powered aircraft carrier. That's just the amount that they raised the guidance by 10 billion. If you're talking 85 billion now, that's bigger than the GDP of Croatia, Sri Lanka, Panama. That is what they're spending this year on capital expenditures, and that's just one company in one year. This AI trend is unbelievable. When you look at the spending ratcheting up like that, I get really excited thinking about who is on the receiving end of those dollars. There's going to be spending on the GPUs. There's going to be spending on data centers. Power needs are going to be going up. There are so many ways that this can trickle throughout the economy that gets me really excited.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, all this AI spending could be worth it if they're getting a return and it looks like so far they are. What are your thoughts on just this general trend toward billions and billions of dollars being pumped into the AI infrastructure right now?\n\nTom Gardner: Yeah, the first thing is that the reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated. They've been making transitions in their search with Gemini. I'll talk about that in a second, but the business is fundamentally on very solid footing and now they are succeeding and utilizing that AI in profitable ways and breakthrough ways in their overall ecosystem. Google is a Cloud and AI story, and companies that aren't in the Cloud today and aren't accelerating AI every single day are going to be in deep, deep trouble and it's going to come a lot faster than people think. On the Cloud front, Google Cloud is taking market share now from AWS. Their revenue run rate for Google Cloud is $50 billion. Their operating margins raised up to 20% this quarter. Google Cloud is vibrant and a force for the company. On the AI front, Google's scaling Gemini across all those search. Search is essentially becoming a private label brand for Google now, like Kirkland at Costco or 365 at Whole Foods. The private label brand search, 60% of all searches are being resolved without any user click. Think about that. The Gemini feature where you're getting that AI expression when you search something on a mobile screen takes up 75% of screen space. Google is all in on Cloud and AI, and one of the ironies I see with that $85 billion CapEx and one of the things I see about that increase of 10 billion, as Jon said, up to $85 billion in CapEx is also a company that will be working people out of jobs at Google. What that is telling us is that this automation is real. It is significant. People who are investing in AI companies, but not using AI in their everyday life and at their companies are going to fall so far behind so quickly now.\n\nGoogle is just one of the many large technology companies that are demonstrating. This is real. This is enormous. We're betting our entire company to make sure that we're in leadership position in our category. For Google shareholders, thank heavens for that because if Google had fallen behind further, it would be harder and harder for them to catch up both on the Cloudfront and in terms of AI applications. The one caution I have for Google shareholders is just anti competitive practices and whether the regulators are going to get involved with that Gemini search now. Because Gemini search is saving them. They may be a decline in search coming to the Google platform because you can get so much right off Chat GPT or Cloud, Grok, etc, perplexity. But that Gemini application is bringing more and more revenue into search for Google. They're actually on solid footing with their search and the business is on solid footing and if they don't run into regulators, I think you've got a double digit market outperformer in Google from here.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, speaking of AI investment, service now I know that's a company you follow. They just posted a really strong second quarter. That was in my opinion, the strongest earnings report as far as the surprise of all the ones we're talking about. I believe their CEO would agree with you. Bill McDermott said in the earnings release, every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI. Even after today's upward move, the stock's still down in 2025. For one, I'm pretty sure you agree with their CEO, but two, what do you make of their future growth prospects now?\n\nTom Gardner: Well, I think the growth prospects are bright for service now. They have excellent underlying financials. You see 30% operating margins just about just short of that, 98% renewal rates among their customers. This is a fantastic business being run quite successfully. I do agree, as you mentioned and mentioned from Bill McDermott, that AI is the new UI that all future product development is coming through AI, fundamentally, all B to C experiences, all consumer experiences and dig will be on AI applications. The one question I have as a service now shareholder ourselves at the Motley Fool is the company has a $200 billion market cap. I think it can outperform the market, but we see those great earnings leading to a marginal increase in the stock today and that's partially just because it's such a richly valued company. A lot of element areas of the market are richly priced right now. I just be patient. Every time you get a chance to buy service now when it's down 10 or 15%, I take advantage of that, and I think you'll be rewarded with profitable investments.\n\nMatt Frankel: Next up, we're going to take a look at IBM's earnings real quick and Figma's upcoming IPO. I'm excited to talk about that.\n\nMALE_1: LD super six fruit and veg comes with a freshness guarantee from just 29 peach red grape fruit, spring onions, pinkeds, apples, and mixed peppers, plus British Jersey roll potatoes and cherries, and the cherry on top. Amazing LD value in store now. LD which cheapest supermarket 2024. Products and prices may vary subject to availability.\n\nMatt Frankel: Jon, IBM shares are down after earnings despite beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The key reason seems to be that the management team is really cautious right now. The CEO said some clients are being cautious due to trade tensions, US federal spending is down, and there are a few other reasons. What are your thoughts on IBM's quarter and is the stock a buy right now?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah, I was surprised that the stock was down after looking over the numbers. Most of the metrics were up and above expectations. Of course, we should keep in mind that with the drop it's still outperforming the S&P 500 over the last year and year to date so context matters I think. But look when it comes to IBM, I think it's really easy to dismiss it from the artificial intelligence conversation because it's such an old business. It doesn't scream AI to me, but all these businesses out there right now are trying to figure out how do use AI in our company and many of them don't know how to do that. That means that they need consulting. It turns out that IBM is pretty good at this. CEO Arvin Krishna said it's book of business for generative AI is now at 7.5 billion and accelerating. Essentially, companies are coming to IBM and looking to how do we integrate AI into what we're doing. That means that they're really actually pretty well positioned and probably better positioned than a lot of investors give them credit for.\n\nNow, granted, IBM only expects about 5% revenue growth this year. Usually when I'm looking at a tech stock to buy, I want to see a little bit better growth in this. That said, over the last couple of years I've just had this growing conviction that IBM is better positioned than people give them credit for. For me, it is a stock to watch.\n\nMatt Frankel: Well, maybe Warren Buffet shouldn't have sold it when he did. Now let's get to the story that I've been really looking forward to. We're going to talk about Figma's IPO. Jonathan, I want to bring you in on this. We're starting to see a resurgence in IPO activity and one big, highly anticipated IPO that's about to go public is Figma. Before we dive in, can you just give us a 32nd description of what Figma does?\n\nJonathan Wilder: Figma is essentially a Google Docs, essentially for UIUX, it allows collaboration between multiple designers to create rapid prototypes which can then be put into the prototype present feedback and iterate loop, which most corporations use to develop new products. That's essentially what they do.\n\nMatt Frankel: Talking to you before the show, I think it would be fair to say, maybe this is an understatement that you're not entirely bullish on the growth story here. Can you tell us why you're approaching Figma with so much caution?\n\nJonathan Wilder: First came out in 2012. They are very much, in my view attached to a an older way of developing products, which again, going back to that is very much the prototype present feedback and iterate. That process can take days, weeks or even months in a typical corporation. With generative AI, that can go down to literally 30 minutes. Instead of getting one prototype back from a design team, you're getting 5-10 prototypes back in less than a day. That alone is a huge disruption for Figma. It's a huge disruption for Adobe and any companies in this space. That's my major. Actually, one example is Galileo is a generative AI competitor to Figma. They were just purchased by Google about a month and a half ago, renamed Stitch and made available completely for free. If you're taking a look at a $75 seat license for FIGMA, you now have an option just to use Google Stitch for free. If I come from a start-up background, and if I raised $5 million at a $20 million valuation, I have the option, should I hire a FIGMA expert for 140 or $150,000 a year or should I just hire AI bots in the form of Stitch, Galileo, and some other versions of AI versions of a Figma and save myself a huge amount of money. I think currently, large corporations are the ones that are stuck on Figma. However as a good example is the Parsons School of Design in New York City are actively now beginning to teach generative AI design. The new designers that are coming out, the younger designers that are entering the workforce, the first tools that they're going toward are generative AI tools. They do not go to Figma. They do not go to Photoshop, even at this point. That's my main thesis, where I'm not too bullish on it.\n\nJon Quast: Jonathan, I think a lot of investors would be reading over the S1 when it comes to Figma and looking at that 46% year over year revenue growth. I think there's a sense that the generative AI trend is already mature. How do we take what you've just shared about the business and maybe some of the risks. But then also how do we counterbalance that with the 46% revenue growth that we see?\n\nJonathan Wilder: Generative AI really started in 2018, 2019 with the transformer architecture. That was first released for the public with Chat GPT in late 2022. However, the generative AI scope of what it's covering it first started to attack coding, the models are continuously being evolved. It then started doing things with the Chat GPT of image generation, runway with video generation, and this area of rapid prototyping is something that is not necessarily a focus of generative AI because if you use something like a cursor or a wind surf you can actually bypass Figma completely because as you're building a design using one of those tools or a bolt is you can ask with very specific prompts to build the design. It will also build the code at the background and will also deploy the code and the design live to a hosting environment. You're talking about Google earlier, Google's doing a very good job of integrating all of these types of tools, and that's why they purchased Stitch, where once you create a design on Stitch, which you would have done previously in FIGMA, now it's already creating the code.\n\nWith one click, it's in Google Colab, which is their development environment and another click, it's in Google Cloud. FIGMA does not have any of that type of functionality built in. The pace of how that's going to evolve is, I would say, exponential over the next year. Most of what Figma has put on in terms of generative AI, I see mostly as band aids, marketing hype. It's unclear what they'll do over the next year. They can turn it around and put really useful generative AI tools within their interface which hasn't changed a huge amount, really in the past decade. Those [MUSIC] are my major concerns.\n\nMatt Frankel: Thanks Jonathan, for that clarity on Figma. It will be really interesting to watch once that one goes public next week.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nA group of former Tesla HR professionals alleged that they were either fired or effectively forced to resign after attempting to surface other employees‚Äô race discrimination and retaliation complaints at the company‚Äôs Fremont, California, plant, in a complaint filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nPer the lawsuit, Peloquin, et. al. v. Tesla, Inc. , one of the incidents reported by plaintiffs involved a Black employee who received racially charged threats from a White co-worker. An HR employee investigated the incident and recommended that the co-worker be fired, but Tesla allegedly instead forced the HR employee out after firing his supervisor.\n\nOther plaintiffs claimed they sent emails to high-ranking Tesla managers complaining of an ‚Äúextraordinarily high attrition rate‚Äù of HR professionals at the Fremont facility as well as retaliation against HR employees. These plaintiffs alleged they were similarly fired after making their complaints. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe wide-ranging lawsuit concerns a facility that has featured heavily in previous litigation against Tesla. The automaker‚Äôs Fremont facility has been the target of both state and federal regulators over the last several years due to allegations of racial harassment against Black employees and retaliation against workers who complained about harassment.\n\nIn March 2024, the company settled a nearly decade-long case involving an employee who claimed that he and other Black employees were subjected to harassment by co-workers. Federal juries twice sided with the plaintiff at trial, awarding millions of dollars in damages.\n\nAccording to the Peloquin complaint, one of Tesla‚Äôs HR managers was a ‚Äúcommon denominator‚Äù in the various claims made by the plaintiffs. They alleged that the manager, the overall HR manager for the entire Fremont facility, ‚Äúhad an irrational fixation on fostering the delusion that the environment and culture at Tesla is one of tolerance and innovation, rather than racism and retaliation.‚Äù\n\nOne of the plaintiffs, who is a gay man, claimed that the HR manager ‚Äúunilaterally placed him‚Äù in a LGBTQ affinity group for Tesla employees without his permission or consent. When he complained about this decision to a higher-up, the manager initiated an investigation of him and directed a supervisor to terminate him, he alleged.\n\nIn all, the plaintiffs alleged unlawful retaliation, disability discrimination, wrongful termination and failure to prevent unlawful discrimination in violation of California state law.\n\nTesla‚Äôs HR department previously was highlighted in a 2022 lawsuit that claimed the department and management of a Nevada worksite ignored obscene and misogynistic music, allowing an alleged sexually hostile work environment to persist. The parties to that case later determined that an arbitration agreement applied to the dispute.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T13:51:01.151932+00:00"}

In that context, today‚Äôs move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock gained 3.1% on the news that its board of directors approved a new multi-billion dollar compensation package for CEO Elon Musk. The package, which included an award of 96 million shares valued at nearly $30 billion, reassured investors by securing Musk‚Äôs continued leadership. This move was particularly significant because Musk had previously suggested he might develop products outside of Tesla if his ownership stake was not increased. The board's action came after a court had previously voided a different pay package. The stock's climb also occurred during a broader market upswing that lifted other large technology companies.\n\nTesla is down 12.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $330.92 per share, it is trading 31% below its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla‚Äôs shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,499.\n\nUnless you‚Äôve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

The official document was signed off by Andrew Payne, who is cited as the company‚Äôs director. His LinkedIn page shows him as listed as head of energy for the EMEA region of Tesla.\n\nAs well as being the world‚Äôs most recognized maker of electric cars, Tesla has a business supplying battery storage and solar energy.\n\nLast year, the firm saw its revenue from the sale of solar cells, batteries and other energy products nearly double, rising $1.5 billion or 93% compared to a year earlier.\n\nMusk, one of the world‚Äôs richest people, was last week awarded a $29 billion pay package from the firm. Tesla, of which he is the CEO, already supplies electricity to residential properties in Texas.\n\nThe application comes at a time when the firm‚Äôs main business ‚Äì car sales ‚Äì is on the decline. Tesla‚Äôs (TSLA) auto revenue fell 16% from April to June and overall revenue was down 12%, according to its earnings report. Sales of its best-selling Model Y and Model 3 fell 12% compared with a year ago, while sales of its more expensive models, including the Cybertruck, plunged 52%.\n\nSales of new Teslas fell by 60% in July in the UK compared to a year ago, according to the Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders (SMMT). Meanwhile, yearly sales dropped by 22% across Europe, according to June figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers‚Äô Association.\n\nThe significant drop in sales, not only in the US but around the world, are widely perceived to have been a backlash to Musk‚Äôs political activities, as well as the growing competition from other electric vehicle makers, most notably from China.\n\nBack in 2023 Tesla advertised on LinkedIn for a head of operations to run Tesla Electric in the UK.

Not just a small improvement over today‚Äôs lithium-ion cells, but a leap forward in energy density, charging speed and safety. The answer, they believe, lies in solid-state lithium-metal technology.\n\nFor drivers, this shift promises cleaner, greener transportation‚Äîand maybe the end of stressful commutes. For investors, it‚Äôs one of the most dynamic areas in the market. Our Electric Vehicles & Autonomous Driving Screen will help you identify companies with strong potential in this high-growth sector. Stocks like QuantumScape Corp. QS, Lucid Group LCID and XPeng Inc. XPEV are worth watching as the race toward an electrified, autonomous future accelerates.\n\nThe autonomous vehicle (AV) market is also speeding ahead. Valued at about $1.9 trillion in 2023, it‚Äôs expected to soar to over $13.6 trillion by 2030, at an impressive 32% CAGR, per Fortune Business Insights. Advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, sensors and connectivity are making AVs smarter and safer. Better perception, faster decision-making and more reliable systems are moving us closer to a world where cars can drive themselves with minimal human input.\n\nA few years back, an ‚Äúelectric car‚Äù was practically synonymous with Tesla TSLA. But the field has now become crowded. Concerns over climate change and big gains in battery range and charging speeds are making EVs more appealing. Legacy automakers like General Motors GM are going all-in on electrification. Startups such as Rivian Automotive RIVN are also gaining ground. Meanwhile, Chinese brands are flooding the market with a wide range of models and looking to expand globally.\n\nElectric and self-driving cars are reshaping the auto industry. According to the latest report on global EV outlook by International Energy Agency, electric vehicle (EV) sales are expected to jump 25% in 2025, topping 20 million units worldwide. This surge comes as battery prices fall and EVs become more affordable. China is set to dominate, accounting for nearly two-thirds of all sales, followed by Europe and the United States. By year-end, one in every four cars sold could be electric. China also leads in choice‚Äîalmost 60% of models available there are electric, compared with just 12% in the United States.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne of QuantumScape‚Äôs biggest allies in this journey is Volkswagen. The German auto giant, through its battery arm PowerCo, has been backing the company for years. And last month, that relationship deepened. The two announced an expanded collaboration to accelerate development of the QSE-5 battery and set up a pilot production line in San Jose. As part of the deal, PowerCo will provide up to $131 million in milestone-based payments over the next two years‚Äîon top of the $130 million already tied to a future licensing agreement. Volkswagen isn‚Äôt just investing; it‚Äôs likely to be QuantumScape‚Äôs first customer.\n\nThat fits neatly into QuantumScape‚Äôs capital-light strategy. Instead of building massive, capital-intensive factories, the company plans to license its technology to automakers and battery producers‚Äîletting them handle the heavy lifting of manufacturing at scale.\n\nThe company also hit a key milestone in June with its Cobra separator process. Cobra replaces the older Raptor system and is a game-changer: 25 times faster, more compact and far more cost-efficient. In the race to bring solid-state batteries to market, that matters.\n\nWith B1 sample production on the horizon and early field tests planned for 2026, QuantumScape is inching closer to turning its vision into a commercial product‚Äîone that could help shape the future of electric mobility. QS stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today‚Äôs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nLucid: When Lucid burst onto the EV scene, it made waves with the Air sedan‚Äîa sleek, high-performance luxury car. Now, the company has moved beyond its luxury Air sedan with the Gravity SUV, targeting the broader premium SUV market. CEO Peter Rawlinson believes Gravity could be a game-changer, pointing out that its addressable market is six times larger than that of Air.\n\nTo support that growth, Lucid is locking in key parts of its supply chain. A new multi-year deal with Graphite One secures U.S.-sourced natural graphite‚Äîan important step toward building a localized, resilient EV materials network.\n\nLucid operates at the top end of the market, with Air starting above $70,000 and Gravity just under $80,000. But the company is also making ownership more appealing. Effective July 31, 2025, Lucid vehicles have become compatible with Tesla‚Äôs Supercharger network, giving drivers access to over 23,500 charging stations across North America. That‚Äôs a major convenience boost and would help drive more Air sales.\n\nLucid is also pushing into autonomous mobility. In a major deal with Uber, the company will supply more than 20,000 vehicles equipped with Nuro‚Äôs self-driving tech. Uber has sweetened the partnership with a $300 million investment‚Äîboth a financial cushion and a built-in sales channel as Lucid EVs join Uber‚Äôs global fleet.\n\nOn the software side, Lucid rolled out over-the-air updates, with new driver-assist features late last month. And with the backing of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Public Investment Fund, which has invested around $9 billion since 2018, Lucid has the financial muscle to keep its ambitions on track. LCID currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nXPeng: In China‚Äôs fast-moving electric vehicle market, XPeng is emerging as one of the most exciting names to watch. Riding the wave of booming new energy vehicle (NEV) sales and strong government backing, the company is scaling rapidly.\n\nXPeng‚Äôs strategy centers on intelligence-driven cars built for tech-savvy buyers. Its lineup is diverse, covering everything from sleek sedans to family-friendly SUVs. Standouts include the G9, a roomy mid-to-large SUV; the P7i, a sporty sedan; the G6, a coupe-style SUV; and the seven-seat X9 MPV. The value-priced MONA M03 is aimed at budget-conscious buyers, while the P7+ caters to families looking for style and space.\n\nIn June, XPeng added G7, a crossover positioned between G6 and G9. It‚Äôs the first model to feature XPeng‚Äôs in-house Turing AI chip, which delivers triple the computing power of standard smart driving chips. That gives G7 a serious advantage in self-driving performance‚Äîone that could help XPeng stand out in a crowded field.\n\nThe sales numbers tell an equally compelling story. In 2024, XPeng delivered more than 190,000 vehicles, up 34% year over year. But 2025 has taken growth to another level. The first quarter alone saw 94,008 deliveries‚Äîa staggering 331% increase from a year earlier. In the second quarter, XPeng smashed records again with 103,181 cars sold, more than double its year-ago numbers.\n\nInnovation is moving just as fast. The company‚Äôs AI-powered Hawkeye Vision System and XOS 5.4 operating system push its full-stack smart driving ambitions forward. And XPeng is already experimenting with futuristic concepts like flying cars and humanoid robots‚Äîsignaling that it‚Äôs thinking well beyond today‚Äôs roads. Once considered an underdog, XPeng is now racing toward the front of China‚Äôs EV pack. XPEV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Ford said the vehicle will arrive in 2027, with more details to come at a future date.\n\nThe platform will allow the company to make all kinds of form factors, such as sedans, SUVs, and vans, built at scale and with simplicity. Ford said the number of parts will be far fewer and the vehicles will be lighter.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley called it a \"Model T\" moment for the automaker, boldly claiming that this platform, as well as its production process, will revolutionize how the company makes its future EVs.\n\n\"We took a radical approach to solve a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that are breakthrough in every way that matters ‚Äî design, technology, performance, space and cost of ownership ‚Äî and do it with American workers,\" Farley said in a statement.\n\nLast year, Ford's Model e EV unit lost $5.1 billion, and the company expects losses to stay the same in 2025. The company sold 105,000 EVs, meaning the company lost around $48.5K per EV sold.\n\nThose numbers need to change, and Farley and Ford believe both the new platform and production strategy will flip the EV business into the green starting in 2027.\n\nFord said its Universal Assembly Process will make efficiency key to building these new EVs.

Search revenue topped out at $54.1bn versus an anticipated $52.7bn. YouTube ad revenue was $9.8bn versus expectations of $9.5bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud Platform revenue hit $13.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $13.1bn.\n\nThe company's outlook for capital expenditures (capex), however, was higher than expected. The tech giant expects to spend $85bn in the year, $10bn more than had been previously expected.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nBen Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the concerns around disruption from artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, Alphabet produced a really good set of numbers in its latest results. Revenues were up 15%, three percentage points better than expected and the search business delivered at the top of its range. The cloud business, meanwhile, was also a strong performer with revenues up 32% so it is encouraging to see the business growing strongly in the face of pressures.\"\n\nHe said that the increase in its capex guidance \"is a very solid raise and should be viewed as a positive, with investment looking to drive away the threat of Chat GPT\".\n\n\"Alphabet has been playing catch up somewhat in the AI arms race, but it is doing well to fend off the likes of Chat GPT,\" said Barringer. \"The big question will be whether it can keep innovating at a pace that allows it to maintain its search monopoly. This boost in investment suggests the fight will continue.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the next big event on the horizon for Alphabet's Google is a judge's ruling in an search antitrust case. Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to issue a ruling on \"remedies\" that follows the Justice Department's victory against the company sometime next month.\n\n\"While it is unlikely to be the end of the saga regardless of the result, any indication that its search monopoly will weaken will not be taken well by the market, especially given the AI threat currently,\" said Barringer. \"This ruling has the potential to either be a clearing event or add to Alphabet‚Äôs uncertainties.

Its cloud business, Azure, saw revenues grow 39%, well ahead of expectations, highlighting that demand for more traditional cloud based services remains strong. Microsoft has a good backlog in this business area too so we should see strong results continue to flow there.\n\n‚ÄúThe company did announce it was slowing the growth of its capex and changing the mix slightly, but as demand remains strong for AI we will likely see the likes of data centres take priority for a number of years yet.\n\nMeta (META) ‚Äì Released second quarter results on Wednesday 30 July\n\nFacebook-parent Meta (META) surged 12% on Thursday after posting a bumper set of results after the market close on 30 July.\n\nMeta said revenue for the three months to the end of June rose 22% from the same period last year to $47.5bn. Meanwhile, profits jumped by 36% to $18.3bn. Profit per share came in at $7.14, above analysts' estimates.\n\nThe company said it expected its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114bn and $118bn. The company added its AI initiatives will ‚Äúresult in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.‚Äù\n\n\"I think there are all these questions that people have about what are going to be the timelines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence ... we've observed the more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen.

Average price per ad was up 9% over the quarter, a clear indication that Meta is delivering an improved product for both users and advertisers.\n\n\"The broader focus now turns to Meta's mammoth AI investment plans and whether it can continue to manage those costs without hurting earnings or free cash flow.\n\n\"CFO commentary called out higher costs next year, and another year of similar capex growth, which many analysts did not have on their bingo cards.

Revenue of $94.04bn was better than the expected $89.30bn. Mac and iPhone revenue were both better than analysts had anticipated, while wearables and iPad numbers fell short. Greater China revenue was $15.37bn compared to an estimate of $15.19bn.\n\nApple expects tariffs to cost the company $1.1bn this quarter, CEO Tim Cook told investors on the earnings call. That's after the iPhone maker took a tariff-related hit to the tune of $800m during the fiscal third quarter which ran through June.\n\nServices revenue, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Pay, came in at $27.4bn, up about 13% year-on-year, continuing its double-digit growth.\n\nCook said Apple (AAPL) was increasing its AI investments. ‚ÄúWe did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter,‚Äù he told analysts, without giving specific numbers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook warned in a second quarter earnings call at the beginning of May that tariffs were expected to add $900m to costs in the third quarter. ¬∑ REUTERS / Reuters\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Britzman said: \"Apple is caught in a sentiment trap. On paper, the company delivered one of its strongest sets of results in recent years ‚Äì robust iPhone sales, a return to growth in China, and encouraging guidance. Ordinarily, that would send shares meaningfully higher. There‚Äôs a sense of unease hanging over Apple, something we haven‚Äôt seen in a long time. Scepticism around its AI positioning, combined with lingering tariff uncertainty, continues to weigh on investor confidence.\"\n\n\"Apple should be a leading name in AI hardware, but that‚Äôs simply not the case,\" he added. \"Apple Intelligence was a flop, so a lot of hope now lies in an AI-powered Siri ‚Äì but that might not come until next year.

Market experts had estimated the company would report around $162bn in revenue and 9% growth. The company‚Äôs Amazon Web Services cloud computing division reported its sales reached $30.9bn in an increase of 17.5% year over year.\n\nHowever, Amazon projected that operating income in the third quarter would be $15.5bn-$20.5bn, which fell short of analyst expectations of $19.4bn.\n\nChief executive Andy Jassy warned of further uncertainty around Trump‚Äôs tariff policies and said he remained ‚Äúunsure‚Äù who would absorb potentially higher costs over time.\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nHe also gave a clear indication that the e-commerce giant will continue its AI push. \"AI is going to be the biggest transformation of our lifetime,‚Äù he said during a call with analysts on Thursday. ‚ÄúEvery single area of the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by AI.\"\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Just as it looked as if investors were ready to go all-in to big tech again, Amazon has come along and spoiled the party. A negative reaction to its results and a lacklustre response to Apple‚Äôs numbers would suggest the market has become more discerning.\"\n\n\"It is spending big on AI infrastructure, leading to more subdued profit guidance than expected,\" he said. \"The retail side of its business is caught up in Trump‚Äôs spiderweb of tariffs, which creates ongoing uncertainty.\"\n\n‚ÄúCompetition remains fierce for cloud computing services and Amazon‚Äôs sales growth rate is struggling to match rivals Microsoft and Alphabet,\" Coatsworth added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) ‚Äì Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 27 August\n\nAs an enabler of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings have become a major event in the earnings calendar, with some build up to the release of its results as it tends to report later in the season.\n\nInvestor expectations have become increasingly high around Nvidia's earnings, with markets sensitive to any signs of slowdown for the chip giant.\n\nThe stock has seen a marked rebound following turbulence in the first few months of the year amid the DeepSeek AI market shock and Trump's tariff agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed curbs on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China in April. Shares popped last week after the company said that it would resume sales of its H20 chips in China. Nvidia said that the US government had assured the company that licences will be granted, with the chipmaker adding that it hoped to start deliveries soon.\n\nThe recovery in Nvidia shares since mid-April lows has meant the stock is now up 25% year-to-date and recently saw the company become the first publicly traded company to pass the $4tn market capitalisation milestone.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia beat expectations, posting revenue of $44.1bn compared with an expected $43.29bn. The chipmaker guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2% for the second quarter.\n\nGoing into the second-quarter earnings, Britzman warned that investors shouldn't expect \"any meaningful impact\" from the recent turnaround on H20 chip curbs, given the timeframe.\n\n\"However, taking a conservative view, new Chinese sales could drive a $10bn uplift in revenue by year-end, potentially more if things move fast,\" he said. \"NVIDIA may also be able to reverse some of the $4.5bn inventory write-down from the first quarter, providing a direct boost to earnings.\"\n\nHe added: \"Outside of China, overall demand remains critical. Markets have already heard from major customers that data centre expansion is a priority, which should benefit Nvidia.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T15:12:26.305218+00:00"}

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla‚Äôs driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference ‚Äì meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots ‚Äì and large-scale AI training.\n\n‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,‚Äù Musk posted late Friday evening. ‚ÄúThe Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.‚Äù\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put ‚Äúmany AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOne could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,‚Äù he said.\n\nMusk has talked about Dojo since 2019, reiterating that Dojo would be a cornerstone of Tesla‚Äôs mission to achieve full self-driving and commercialize humanoid robots. Talk of Dojo halted around August 2024 when Musk began touting Cortex instead, a ‚Äúgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs not clear if Cortex is still in the works. TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla to learn more, as well as to inquire about the fate of the Dojo facility Tesla had invested $500 million to build in Buffalo, New York.\n\nThe shift in strategy comes at a time when Tesla is experiencing falling EV sales and significant brand damage after Musk‚Äôs forays into politics. Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T15:20:02.646837+00:00"}

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this electric car maker have returned +4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has gained 8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nTesla is expected to post earnings of $0.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -34.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -31.4%. This estimate has changed -11.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.51 indicates a change of +50.8% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:04:33.383675+00:00"}

Giving software and systems the capacity to make split-second decisions without human oversight is a game-changer for most industries around the globe. It's also the reason analysts at PwC foresee AI boosting worldwide gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion come 2030.\n\nWhile most Wall Street analysts have lofty expectations for the AI revolution, billionaire money managers have been more tempered with their optimism.\n\nFor example, Duquesne Family Office's billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller was an active seller of a number of brand-name AI stocks during the March-ended quarter. We know this, because institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter. A 13F provides a concise snapshot of which stocks the smartest fund managers have been buying and selling.\n\nWhile Druckenmiller was sending shares of AI-data mining specialist Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.57%) and North American electric-vehicle (EV) leader Tesla (TSLA 4.74%) to the chopping block, he was also piling into an AI-driven business with an estimated addressable market of $50 billion.\n\nPopular AI stocks get the heave-ho from billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller\n\nBetween Dec. 31, 2024, and March 31, 2025, Duquesne's billionaire chief was a busy bee. The total number of securities overseen by Druckenmiller dropped from 78 to 52 in just three months. Two of the more prominent stocks that were pared down or jettisoned include Tesla, which was reduced by 50% (18,837 shares sold), and Palantir, where all 41,710 shares were sold.\n\nThere's no denying that both companies have enjoyed clearly defined competitive advantages. Palantir's government-focused Gotham platform has no one-for-one replacement, while its enterprise-driven Foundry service lacks large-scale competition. As for Tesla, it became the first automaker in more than a half-century to successfully build itself from the ground up to mass-production.\n\nHowever, these first-mover and scaling advantages didn't protect either stock from being reduced or removed.\n\nConsidering that the stocks overseen by Druckenmiller have an average hold time of less than nine months, it's quite possible this selling activity represents nothing more than profit-taking.\n\nShares of Palantir and Tesla both surged following Donald Trump's November victory. Palantir is a logical winner of a unified Republican government that (likely) favors strong defense spending. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk temporarily joining the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as a special employee was viewed as a positive for Tesla.\n\nThe worry is there may be more to this story than just benign profit-taking. While this is merely speculation, Stanley Druckenmiller may have been turned off by Palantir's and Tesla's respective nosebleed valuations.\n\nTesla's EVs, which heavily incorporate AI, have endured more than a half-dozen sweeping price cuts as competition picked up and inventory levels rose. This has pummeled Tesla's vehicle margin and reduced its earnings per share (EPS). Paying close to 130 times forward-year earnings for a company whose growth engine has stalled, and whose margins are floundering, may not be appealing to Duquesne's billionaire chief.\n\nLikewise, Palantir Technologies is valued at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of more than 140! To offer some context, companies that are leading next-big-thing trends have historically topped out with P/S ratios in the range of 30 to 40. No megacap company has ever been able to maintain such an absurd premium as that of Palantir. Seeing this may have coerced Druckenmiller to take his chips completely off the table.\n\nDuquesne's billionaire chief is piling into this up-and-coming artificial intelligence stock\n\nOn other end of the spectrum, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller oversaw the addition of one dozen new stocks to his fund's portfolio during the March-ended quarter. None of these new stocks was purchased more prominently than digital-signatures specialist DocuSign (DOCU -1.62%).\n\nDuring the first three months of 2025, Duquesne Family Office purchased 1,074,655 shares of DocuSign, which had a market value of approximately $87.5 million. In other words, it became a top-10 holding for Druckenmiller.\n\nDocuSign became a Wall Street darling during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. With people encouraged to stay in their homes to prevent a worsening of the pandemic, DocuSign's e-signature services became a staple in a host of industries. Though life has returned to normal in the wake of the pandemic, DocuSign has managed to hang onto the bulk of digital-signature market share. According to Datanyze, it currently holds a 71% share.\n\nBut e-signatures make up just around half of DocuSign's total addressable market. While the digital-signature market is estimated to be worth $26 billion, DocuSign has a fast-growing, high-margin opportunity in contract lifecycle management (CLM) that makes up another $24 billion in addressable opportunity.\n\nThe company's cloud-based CLM operations includes the relatively new Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform, which leans on AI insights to analyze, tailor, and automate the entirety of the agreement lifecycle for businesses. DocuSign's IAM platform can also reduce errors associated with agreements and be integrated with other core systems, such as customer relationship management software, to improve efficiency.\n\nAlthough competition is picking up in the e-signature arena, and DocuSign's annual growth rate has slowed considerably from the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's balance sheet and valuation may be added lures for Druckenmiller.\n\nWhen DocuSign's fiscal first quarter came to a close on April 30, it had nearly $1.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and investments on its balance sheet, along with no debt. A pristine balance sheet has allowed for a steady diet of share repurchases, which tend to have a positive impact on EPS over time.\n\nIn terms of valuation, DocuSign is trading at 19 times forecast EPS for fiscal 2027. Even accounting for a slower annual growth rate, this represents a 37% discount to its average forward price-to-earnings ratio over the last half-decade.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:04:49.196667+00:00"}

In the case of Tesla (TSLA 4.71%), the range of possible outcomes is broad, and investors should consider it a high-risk but potentially high-reward stock. Here's what you need to know before buying the stock.\n\nTesla's fortunes depend on its robotaxi and unsupervised full self-driving offerings\n\nMost investment valuations for Tesla proscribe significantly more value to the company from its robotaxi and full self-driving (FSD) software (supervised and unsupervised).\n\nIn other words, while the electric vehicle business is critical to the company, it's not where most of the value lies. No one, except the most committed naysayers, values Tesla purely as a car company. It's a good idea to think of Tesla in a year in terms of the following considerations:\n\nTesla's electric vehicle (EV) deliveries have declined by 13% year over year for the last two quarters as relatively high interest rates make buying cars more expensive, and CEO Elon Musk has acknowledged that Tesla \"could have a few rough quarters\" due to the removal of federal EV tax credits.\n\nWhere will the robotaxi rollout be then, and what does it mean for the rest of the business?\n\nTesla's EV sales\n\nThe company's EV deliveries (equating to its sales volume, as Tesla sells direct to the consumer) are currently declining, and so is its market share globally and in the U.S. That said, there are some nuances in the sales figures that investors need to consider. There is a fascinating dynamic at play whereby Tesla is seeing a significant decline in its most popular SUV, Model Y, compared to its more sporty, but less expensive, sedan, Model 3.\n\nAccording to Kelley Blue Book EV automotive sales data, Tesla Model 3 sales/deliveries were up almost 38% year to date in the first half on a year-over-year basis. Interpolating the data shows that Tesla's U.S. sales, excluding the Model Y, were up 14.1% year to date in the first half on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThis fact makes it somewhat implausible that Tesla, at least in the U.S., is facing a buyer's strike due to Musk's political opinions, as it's hard to imagine why buyers would decide to avoid buying the Model Y but not the Model 3.\n\nThe reality is that Tesla's sales decline in 2026 is really a story of the Model Y decline, mainly due to the release of price-competitive EV SUVs, and a pause in sales as deliveries of the refreshed Model Y only started in March.\n\nNaturally, the company is aware of the price competitiveness issue, and it's not a coincidence that the new affordable model, set to be available in the fourth quarter, is just a Model Y, according to Musk, albeit it's likely to be a pared-down version.\n\nAll told, Musk has said Tesla could have a few rough quarters, and the removal of the EV tax credit is significant, and Tesla's Model Y refresh, at least on initial view, doesn't look like it's enough to turn sales around. On the other hand, Tesla will face easier sales comparisons for the Y next year, as the affordable Model Y is set to go on sale and interest rates might be lower.\n\nThere are a range of possibilities, but not all of them are negative. Perhaps the safest conclusion is that Tesla will still dominate the U.S. market (current EV market share in the mid 40% range). Still, its operating profit margin will remain under pressure (currently just 4.1% in the second quarter) as affordable models are likely to come with lower margins.\n\nRobotaxis and unsupervised full self-driving are the key\n\nOn the recent earnings call, Musk stated, \"I think we will probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year.\" And in the earnings release, the company noted \"Our purpose-built Robotaxi product -- Cybercab ... is scheduled for volume production starting in 2026.\"\n\nA snapshot of Tesla in a year could show the following:\n\nA massively expanded robotaxi service, which in turn encourages sales of its FSD software and sales of Tesla vehicles (as buyers warm to the idea of potentially transforming their cars into robotaxis).\n\nTesla gearing up for the production of its dedicated robotaxi product, Cybercab, in 2026.\n\nTesla in a year\n\nA negative snapshot sees ongoing sales declines due to an aging lineup of cars, notably the Model Y, and a slow robotaxi rollout, and ongoing delays for regulatory approval of unsupervised, fully autonomous ride sharing (in this case, Tesla's unsupervised FSD). Musk thinks unsupervised FSD will be available in \"certain geographies\" by the end of 2025, but the doubters will point out his track record of being overly optimistic.\n\nA more positive scenario sees Tesla's sales growing again, with unsupervised FSD approved in some areas, robotaxi rollouts spurring EV and FSD sales, and Cybercab production around the corner, while Wall Street analysts are scrambling to pencil in assumptions for a long stream of explosive growth from robotaxi revenue sharing.\n\nThe answer lies somewhere in between the two, with the long-term potential from robotaxis/FSD making Tesla an attractive stock for risk-tolerant investors.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:04:50.401686+00:00"}

The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo head Ganesh Venkataramanan and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.\n\nIt also comes at a crucial time for Tesla.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has pushed to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.\n\nTesla‚Äôs decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla‚Äôs AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to ‚Äúprocess truly vast amounts of video data.‚Äù He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company‚Äôs second-quarter earnings call.\n\nIn 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company‚Äôs market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla‚Äôs AI team would ‚Äúdouble down‚Äù on Dojo in the lead-up to Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi reveal, which happened in October.\n\nBut talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.‚Äù\n\nThe Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021. Venkataramanan presented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia‚Äôs GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor.\n\nSources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing.

As a tech company, Tesla is heavily invested in artificial intelligence and robotics, but Ritchie has a warning for investors. ‚ÄúIt is still too soon to bet on it at this valuation,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúespecially since most of Tesla‚Äôs developments are focused on autonomous driving, which still faces a lot of challenges including regulatory ones that could delay it for at least a couple of years.‚Äù\n\nCompared to other tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon, Tesla still has a higher P/E ratio, but this may be more due to its leadership as a car company.\n\nAs a car manufacturer, Tesla‚Äôs market cap of nearly $1 trillion dwarfs that of legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors. However, recent performance has raised concerns. In Q2 2025, Tesla‚Äôs vehicle deliveries dropped 13.5%, falling to 384,122 units compared to 443,956 in the same period last year. This decline has impacted earnings and shaken investor confidence in some markets.\n\nAdditionally, according to David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX, an automated trading platform, ‚Äú[Tesla hasn‚Äôt] yet proved that they can dominate the EV market.

It could also push some BESS operators out of the state‚Äôs market, they said. But analysts with Aurora Energy Research told Utility Dive it‚Äôs unlikely to result in dramatic operational changes.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe four-hour state of charge requirement was already unfavorable for BESS operators, but any negative impact from maintaining the status quo may be offset by less contentious revisions to the protocol, said Olivier Beaufils, Aurora head of U.S. Central.\n\nFor example, the commission shortened the duration requirement for resources in the ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service from two hours to one hour, broadening access for shorter-duration energy storage systems, he said.\n\nAs for the four-hour requirement for non-spin reserve resources, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a change there,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more that the evolution people were expecting is not going to happen anytime soon,‚Äù Beaufils said, adding, ‚ÄúI think ERCOT is being a bit conservative as to what deployment for non-spin means.‚Äù\n\nCapstone expects the commission to revisit the four-hour requirement and other duration changes of the revised protocol about a year after they take effect on Dec. 5, Chen and Patel wrote. Stakeholders that opposed the changes may seek further revisions before then and ERCOT itself may revisit them if they appear to impact grid reliability, the analysts added.\n\nThe Dec. 5 effective date coincides with the rollout of the Real-Time Co-optimization plus Batteries program, or RTC+B, a broader framework to optimize batteries‚Äô energy and ancillary services in real time.\n\nThough proponents expect the RTC+B framework to more efficiently manage battery dispatch and potentially create new value streams for BESS operators, at least two Texas operators voted against the four-hour state of charge requirement at an ERCOT committee meeting in May, Aurora associate Aditi Shetty said in an interview.\n\n‚ÄúTheir argument, in a nutshell, is that by keeping non-spin [state of charge] at four hours, you decrease the amount of energy storage resources available to respond during periods of system stress,‚Äù she said, referring to dissenters Engie and Jupiter Power. ‚ÄúEffectively, you are taking a chunk of available megawatts off the system.‚Äù\n\nAnother way to look at it is that ERCOT doles out non-spin reserve awards in five-minute intervals, so a four-hour requirement means a battery system would need to maintain 48 times the charge needed to perform during a single interval, Shetty said. The independent market monitor‚Äôs one-hour recommendation would require just 12 times the needed charge.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-11T16:05:18.661456+00:00"}

Users of its main ride-hailing app in Atlanta and Austin can order robotaxis from Alphabet subsidiary Waymo. It also struck a deal with electric carmaker Lucid Motors and autonomous driving company Nuro to put 20,000 Lucid vehicles, owned by Uber and running Nuro‚Äôs self-driving tech, on the road in the next six years.\n\nSpeaking on the company‚Äôs second-quarter earnings call Wednesday, Khosrowshahi raised Uber‚Äôs publicly stated ambitions. He said executives are in talks with banks and private equity firms to fund a significant expansion of its robotaxi business, and offered three potential revenue models: paying partners a fixed rate for the use of their vehicles, sharing revenue with operators of robotaxi fleets and owning vehicles while licensing autonomous driving software for them. ‚ÄúOnce we prove the revenue model, how much these cars can generate on a per-day basis, there will be plenty of financing to go around,‚Äù he said confidently. In the interim, Khosrowshahi has smaller plans:\n\nUber said it will dedicate a ‚Äúmodest‚Äù amount of its $7 billion in annual cash flows to fund robotaxi deployments, and could sell minority stakes in companies to finance further expansion. Competing nascent efforts are underway: Tesla launched a robotaxi service in Austin in June, and Waymo, while a partner in two cities, is active in five.\n\nUber posted a better-than-expected revenue increase of 18% in the second quarter on Wednesday and unveiled a $20 billion share buyback plan as it offered an upbeat outlook for the third quarter. Khosrowshahi cited a ‚Äúcontinued confidence in the business‚Äù when talking about the buyback, which also hints at why he‚Äôs willing to seek financing for the robotaxi expansion.\n\nReasonably Robotic: On the earnings call, Uber said there has been no dip in demand in cities where robotaxi services have launched. That‚Äôs among the many appealing factors of a potential expansion: another would be the prospect of better margins if the company relies on fewer human drivers.

Let's take a look at the stock price. It's up in the pre-market, up about just under 10% there after a 41% jump yesterday. A broader cannabis stock rally has been sparked by fresh hopes for US federal reform. Cannabis is fully legal in 24 states, but not at a federal level. Now, President Trump might change that. He said he's considering reclassifying marijuana within the next few weeks, potentially removing it from Schedule I, the category where it currently sits alongside heroin and LSD. That move could unlock tax deductions and open the door to new institutional investment. The legal cannabis market in the US alone is already worth more than $30 billion a year, and analysts see that number doubling within the next decade if federal barriers fall. Tilray's not alone. Canopy Growth, Aurora Cannabis, SNDL, and Cronos Group have all climbed in double digits. Okay, our second trending ticker today is Tesla. It's trading at about $341 in the pre-market after it climbed nearly 3% yesterday. Investors are digesting some significant updates from the Musk Empire. Yesterday, Elon Musk confirmed he's disbanded the Dojo supercomputer team and will pivot to in-house A15 and A16 chips. These chips are expected to power full self-driving Optimus robots and upcoming models like the Cybercab and the next-gen Roadster. Second, and this is very much a moving story today, Musk said his startup XAI was going to take legal action against Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of antitrust violations in managing App Store rankings, although he didn't provide evidence to support his claim. So, between AI strategy pivots and legal drama, keep an eye on the Tesla ticker today. And finally, we look at CoreWeave. The AI infrastructure firm is losing some steam in the pre-market ahead of its highly anticipated earnings report after the closing bell today. You can see it's down nearly around 3% after a very strong performance yesterday. It closed up nearly 8%. We're starting to see increasingly contrasting views on the stock. Bulls, including JP Morgan, remain confident that the growth narrative will hold with high expectations fueled by increased infrastructure spending by major players like Google and Microsoft. But, CoreWeave is a risky trade right now. The stock has seen wild swings and shed roughly a third of its value from its June peak, burdened by rising debt and concerns that the recent AI hype may have peaked. Some market watchers point out that CoreWeave may not be able to deliver on the growth prospects it sold, and the stock might see more big swings in the coming days as the lock-up prohibiting insiders from selling shares after the IPO expires in just two days time on August 14th.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:39.824852+00:00"}

Based on Tesla‚Äôs closing price of $339.03 on Aug. 11, 2025, the shares are currently worth about $32.5 billion.\n\nTo put that dollar amount into context, consider this: If you suddenly found yourself with $32.5 billion, you‚Äôd be the 60th-richest person in the world, according to the latest Forbes billionaire list.\n\nMusk himself remains the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $418.5 billion. But his lead is shrinking ‚Äî mainly because Tesla‚Äôs stock price has fallen by roughly one-quarter since closing at $426.50 on Jan. 17, 2025. On that date, the 96 million shares would have been worth $40.9 billion.\n\nBut weep not for Musk. A year ago, Tesla traded for around $201 a share, so its value has risen by nearly 69% since then.\n\nExplore More: I Asked ChatGPT: How Many Middle-Class Retirements Could You Fund With Elon Musk‚Äôs Wealth?\n\nTaking Stock of Musk‚Äôs Wealth\n\nMusk‚Äôs wealth is almost all connected to his holdings in Tesla, rocket producer SpaceX and artificial intelligence startup xAI. He owns about 12% of Tesla excluding options, according to Forbes. Tesla‚Äôs market cap is roughly $1 trillion, so a 12% stake would equal about $120 billion.\n\nAs Forbes noted, Musk‚Äôs legal situation with Tesla started in early 2024, when a Delaware judge voided Musk‚Äôs 2018 deal to receive options that equaled another 9% of the company. Pending Musk‚Äôs appeal, Forbes has discounted the options by 50%.\n\nTesla Takes a Few Hits\n\nTesla‚Äôs stock woes this year have their roots in both politics and business fundamentals.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:44.245784+00:00"}

Tesla is already there, but the company's EV lead is slipping.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/12/better-ev-stock-ford-vs-tesla/", "published_at": "2025-08-12T07:22:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Most automakers, including Ford, are trying to position themselves for an EV future. Tesla is already there, but the company's EV lead is slipping.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) industry holds a lot of promise, but it's also facing significant headwinds. Rising materials costs because of tariffs, an uncertain economy, and lackluster consumer demand are making it harder for EVs to be successful.\n\nBut during this time of transition, it's not a bad idea to consider which companies are leaders in the EV space and how their current dominance could boost their stock in the coming years, after market conditions improve.\n\nThat's why it's worth assessing the positions of Ford (F -0.22%) and Tesla (TSLA 2.85%) right now. Both are automotive powerhouses in their own right, but which is the better long-term EV stock? Let's have a look.\n\nThe EV advantage: Tesla\n\nIt's no surprise that Tesla has the EV advantage, considering the company started as an EV maker and didn't have to transition to the industry the same way Ford did. But it's important to note just how far ahead Tesla is as an EV leader, compared to Ford.\n\nOut of the top 10 best-selling EVs in the U.S. so far this year, three of them are Teslas -- the Cybertruck, the Model Y, and the Model 3 -- and the company takes the top two spots on the list. In total, it has sold an estimated 721,000 EVs in the U.S. in the first half of this year.\n\nFord has an impressive two models on the best-selling EV list: the Lightning pickup and the Mustang Mach-E. But where Tesla and Ford diverge is in how many EVs they sell, with Ford coming up woefully short at just 47,200 in the first seven months of this year. That amounts to Tesla selling more than 15 times the number of EVs Ford currently sells.\n\nI will add, though, that Tesla's sales are severely slumping. The company's vehicle deliveries are down 13% from the year-ago quarter. It's still on top, but it clearly has its work cut out for it if it wants to stay there. Ford, for its part, is experiencing a slowdown, too, with EV sales down 10%.\n\nThe long-term innovation advantage: Tesla\n\nTesla's brand is suffering right now, mostly in response to CEO Elon Musk's past involvement overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency and his polarizing political views, both of which have contributed to Musk being distracted from managing the company.\n\nDespite this, the company is looking to a future that involves far more than EVs. It says it is already producing 5,000 Optimus humanoid robots this year and has launched a limited robotaxi service that's part of Musk's broader vision for autonomous vehicles.\n\nBoth of these businesses are potentially lucrative but are still in their early form. For example, humanoid robotics will be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford is still trying to get a handle on EVs. CEO Jim Farley said recently that the company \"plans to design and build a breakthrough electric vehicle and platform in the U.S.\" next year.\n\nI give a lot of leeway to automakers right now as they try to figure out the best course of action in a difficult selling environment. But if I had to choose between buying the stock of a company that's already successful with EVs (and expanding into new, innovative markets) and an automaker that's still trying to figure out electric vehicles, I'm going to choose the former.\n\nVerdict: Tesla wins, but maybe hold off on buying just yet\n\nJust because one company is better than another at doing something -- in this case, making and selling EVs -- doesn't automatically make its stock a buy. Tesla has some serious hurdles to clear over the next few years, including ensuring Musk is laser-focused on managing the company, turning around EV sales, and (eventually?) launching a new vehicle model.\n\nSo, if you're bent on buying an EV stock and you're only deciding between Tesla and Ford, then I would certainly go with Tesla. But just know that the company's sales and earnings are on the decline right now, and it could take a while before things turn around.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:02:57.298881+00:00"}

Ultraviolette‚Äôs global expansion follows the 2024 launch of its F77 Mach 2 flagship model and its second product, the F77 SuperStreet, in February.\n\nBehind Ultraviolette are two childhood friends ‚Äî CEO Narayan Subramaniam and CTO Niraj Rajmohan ‚Äî who combined their expertise in mechanical engineering, automotive design, computer science, and electronics to electrify the mid-segment two-wheeler market.\n\nThe duo, which drew inspiration from Tesla, started Ultraviolette at a time when India‚Äôs electric two-wheeler market was dominated by low-speed models, mainly catering to commercial and utility needs. The early boom was driven by Chinese imports offering low-cost options, followed by a wave of homegrown startups and, more recently, legacy manufacturers entering the space.\n\nInstead of becoming just another player in that race, the Ultraviolette co-founders set out to build electric motorcycles that could match the performance of 150cc to 800cc internal combustion engine sports bikes.\n\n‚ÄúWe asked ourselves, if we have to make electric exciting in two-wheelers, what would it take? And that‚Äôs the objective with which we started,‚Äù said Rajmohan (pictured above, right) in an exclusive interview.\n\nThe Bengaluru-based startup took about four years from its inception in 2016 to unveil the first model in 2019. The startup went through multiple design iterations before finalizing the seventh version ‚Äî hence the name F77. The commercial version debuted with a fixed battery pack to deliver over 186 miles of range and a top speed of 96 miles/hour with a 30kW peak power and up to 100 newton-meters of torque.\n\nUltraviolette has also unveiled the lightweight Shock Wave motorcycle as well as the Tesseract scooter, which features front and rear radars and cameras to enable an assisted-driving experience and blindspot detection. The scooter costs ‚Çπ145,000 ($1,650), while its motorcycles (ex-showroom) have a base price of ‚Çπ175,000 ($2,000) and goes up to $10,000.\n\nUltraviolette F77 Mach 2 Image Credits:Ultraviolette\n\nUltraviolette‚Äôs vehicles come equipped with eSIM connectivity and feature predictive maintenance powered by a proprietary diagnostics system. Rajmohan said the system can detect even minor issues, such as when the chain needs lubrication. The startup offers an app that provides all these insights to consumers on the go.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:00.456576+00:00"}

The company arguably has the best vehicle technology in the U.S. EV industry, has been on a roll increasing deliveries each quarter, and just inked a potentially massive deal with Uber Technologies. So if Lucid has so much momentum, why is the stock down 30% in 2025?\n\nFrom the top ropes!\n\nOut of nowhere, the conversation around autonomous driving and robotaxi service isn't regarding Tesla or Waymo, but instead an often overlooked electric vehicle (EV) maker, Lucid. That's because a couple of weeks ago news broke that ride-hailing platform Uber Technologies would partner with Lucid to launch a robotaxi service later next year in a major U.S. city, combining integral parts from Nuro, Uber, and Lucid.\n\nUber is targeting to deploy 20,000 or more Lucid vehicles equipped with the Nuro Driver over six years with the first prototype already operating autonomously on a closed circuit at Nuro's Las Vegas track. Even better news is that Uber plans to put its money where its mouth is and is investing in Lucid.\n\n\"This investment from Uber further validates Lucid's fully redundant zonal architecture and highly capable platform as ideal for autonomous vehicles, and our industry-leading range and spacious well-appointed interiors, as ideal for ridesharing,\" Interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said in a press release. \"This is the start of our path to extend our innovation and technology leadership into this multi-trillion-dollar market.\"\n\nWhere art thou, momentum?\n\nThere's no question Lucid has momentum behind it with six consecutive quarters of record-breaking vehicle deliveries, culminating in the second quarter of 2025. Add in the fact that Lucid is just now accelerating production of the new Gravity SUV, and there are likely to be more record-breaking quarters in the future.\n\nSo with all this momentum in sales, and with a bright partnership with Uber and Nuro, why is Lucid down 30% in 2025? The problem is that Lucid has also been hit with a triple whammy of negative developments.\n\nFirst, the loss of regulatory credit sales is a big slap to all young EV makers. Essentially EV makers are given credits for producing zero-emission vehicles, whereas automakers producing vehicles that don't meet emissions standards were fined. At the time automakers that needed to offset their lineup of gasoline-powered vehicles simply purchased regulatory credits from EV makers to meet emissions standards. That was until the current administration took away penalties for missing standards, effectively removing any incentive to purchase regulatory credits from manufacturers such as Lucid.\n\nSecond, in the world's least kept secret, the $7,500 tax credit is disappearing officially on Sept. 30, which means every qualifying vehicle will be more expensive to purchase in the near term. This is expected to pull forward demand from consumers on the fence about purchasing into the third quarter, also leaving a demand lull in the fourth quarter -- so it's going to be a bumpy end to 2025. It also puts immense pressure on Lucid to accelerate production of the Gravity SUV as soon as possible to take advantage of the boost in third-quarter demand for EVs.\n\nThird, tariffs have been torturous for automakers that need years to carefully plan logistics, distribution, design, and production. It's commonplace for automakers to import parts to be assembled in America -- but these are still hit with tariffs, hurting companies such as Lucid. Tariffs have also caused some bottlenecks in rare earth materials needed for battery production.\n\nWhat it all means\n\nLucid has plenty of momentum, and its stock price doesn't seem to reflect that at the moment with slower-than-anticipated EV industry growth in the U.S. market. Lucid has plenty of obstacles in its path and is burning through cash rapidly, but it has the backing of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, an excellent product, and momentum going into the back half of 2025. Things should start looking up for Lucid investors.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:01.685224+00:00"}

What makes Tesla stock unique is its position at the intersection of long-term investing and short-term trading. Despite the stock's stomach-churning volatility, plenty of investors remain gung ho about Tesla's future.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nIn my view, it all comes down to one factor: confidence in Tesla's leadership -- particularly its eccentric CEO, Elon Musk.\n\nA few days ago, CNBC investment personality Jim Cramer shared perhaps the most controversial take on Tesla stock that I've heard in years.\n\nLet's break down Cramer's take and examine what he's really saying. Is now a smart time to invest in Tesla stock? Read on to find out.\n\nA Tesla take for the ages\n\nCramer is the host of a CNBC program called Mad Money in which he covers the economy, individual stocks, and broader market themes. On his show, he hosts a segment called \"Lightning Round,\" taking rapid-fire calls from retail investors who ask for advice about their portfolios.\n\nIn the clip below, you'll hear Cramer's response to a caller who asked if Tesla stock might rebound back to her original purchase price.\n\nJim Cramer last night on $TSLA: \"Tesla is morphing right now. It's in transition from being a car company to being a technology company. You wanna be in there because the tech is worth a lot more than what it's selling for right now. Don't care where you bought it, care where... pic.twitter.com/WzlPdQD7gq -- Sawyer Merritt (@SawyerMerritt) August 5, 2025\n\nAlthough the video is brief, Cramer managed to share several important insights.\n\nInvesting in Tesla stock requires a genuine belief that the company is not a traditional automaker. While the biggest money maker for the company is the electric vehicle (EV) business, Musk has been sharing a vision of transitioning Tesla to a technology platform for years.\n\nWhile Cramer did not offer specifics to the caller, he suggests that Tesla's technology stack is the real reason to own the stock. More specifically, Tesla is pursuing artificial intelligence (AI) products across two primary end markets: robotics and self-driving vehicles.\n\nTesla's autonomous vehicle fleet, dubbed the robotaxi, has officially launched and has its sights on rival platforms from Alphabet's Waymo and Uber Technologies.\n\nIn addition, Musk has proclaimed that Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, could wind up being the largest segment of the company's ecosystem in the long run. While that might sound overzealous, which is quite apropos for Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has shared a similar sentiment, calling robotics a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.\n\nI believe that many investors view Tesla purely as a vehicle manufacturer and either discount or completely overlook the company's AI ambitions. Cramer lost me with his final thought to the caller, though.\n\nHere is where Cramer lost me\n\nInvestors should not try to time the market. Instead, you're better off adding to high-conviction positions for a long time -- buying the stock at various price points. This is an investment strategy commonly referred to as dollar-cost averaging.\n\nOne interpretation of Cramer's advice is that the caller shouldn't worry about the specific price she paid for Tesla stock because this could be just one entry point in a series of buys over the course of several years. The thing is, he didn't really say that.\n\nInstead, Cramer seems confident -- perhaps overly so -- that Tesla stock will rise from its current levels. This is where he (sort of) lost me.\n\nWhere is Tesla stock headed from here?\n\nOver the last five years, Tesla stock has risen by 222% as of this writing (Aug. 7). This absolutely trounces the returns of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, both of which gained roughly 90% over the same period.\n\nThe chart above benchmarks Tesla against its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers on the basis of forward price to earnings (P/E) over the past three years. Throughout the AI boom, Tesla's valuation multiples have consistently outpaced its peers' -- despite the company having little to actually show for its AI ambitions so far.\n\nMany of Tesla's peers have already launched, commercialized, and monetized AI-powered products and services. Meanwhile, Tesla is in the early innings of monetizing robotaxi and launching Optimus. For now, both of these projects remain fairly unproven revenue sources.\n\nThis is an important contrast because investors could argue that much of the upside from Tesla's AI pursuits is already priced into the stock.\n\nTaking this one step further, the analysis above features future earnings estimates. Even though Tesla has yet to generate meaningful profits from its most ambitious bets, the company still fetches a premium valuation multiple over its peers who already have strong footholds in AI.\n\nWhile trying to time the market is a mistake, I do think that price and valuation should matter to investors. If Musk successfully pulls off his AI vision, then Tesla stock could experience a parabolic run for the ages. The big variable here is that no one really knows when robotaxi and Optimus will reach a critical mass.\n\nWhile Tesla stock may rise in the long run, there's no knowing when. Ignoring valuation might work for a swing trade, but for long-term investors, understanding what is priced in -- and what's not -- is crucial. This is what makes Cramer's statement about price a little flawed, in my view.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:03.254420+00:00"}

However, over the past 12 months, the stock has rallied roughly 65%, supported by improving production metrics, pricing stability, and renewed enthusiasm for the company's growth story.\n\nFor many Tesla bulls, the real long-term catalyst remains the company's autonomous-driving technology. Advocates believe its progress in full self-driving capabilities could open up entirely new revenue streams and transform Tesla's earnings profile over the next decade.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T13:03:18.542227+00:00"}

CEO Elon Musk provided an update on the company's robotaxi fleet on Sunday, and new data could suggest that its electric vehicle (EV) sales trends are improving.\n\nA wider robotaxi release\n\nAccording to Barrons, Tesla recently reported longer wait times for its Model Y, rising from one to three weeks to a range of four to six weeks. It could signal that orders are picking up. The first two quarters of the year have shown significant year-over-year decline in EV sales, which is the company's core business for now.\n\nHowever, one reason for the increased wait time could be the elimination of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs that expires at the end of the third quarter.\n\nIn other news, Musk said on X on Sunday that Tesla's robotaxi business would have \"open access next month,\" meaning that customers would not need to be invited to use the service. He also said last Friday that the full self-driving technology on Model Y vehicles in Austin is roughly six months \"more advanced than what is available in cars in America and there are some additional breakthroughs in Tesla AI that will make the car feel eerily human.\"\n\nCurrently, the company is running a soft launch of robotaxis in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, where robotaxis are geofenced (limiting where they can go) and reportedly being monitored by humans remotely.\n\nProgress on robotaxis is good news\n\nAn improving EV business is good news, but given that investors have largely looked past Tesla's poor EV performance, I'm guessing that they are more excited about further progress on robotaxis, which is expected to be a massive new business for the company.

These are two of the largest, most closely watched names in the market, and right now they both appear to be on the verge of significant technical breakouts.\n\nOver the past few months, their paths have diverged. Tesla has been grinding through a year marked by choppy, and volatile price action, while Meta has marched steadily higher, leading the broad market. Despite these differences, both are now aligned in that they both have strong bullish catalysts, and their charts are flashing high-probability breakout signals.\n\nBelow, I‚Äôll break down what‚Äôs driving each stock, highlight the most relevant quantitative metrics, and walk you through the technical setups that could set the stage for the next big move.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla Stock on the Verge of a Comeback\n\nTesla has spent much of the past year navigating a storm of mixed investor sentiment, partly tied to shifting perceptions of its core EV business, partly to Elon Musk‚Äôs sometimes polarizing public presence, and partly to uncertainty over whether the company‚Äôs future lies more in cars or in ambitious side bets like humanoid robots. The result has been choppy, often volatile price action, with the stock barely gaining over the past twelve months even as the broader market has marched higher.\n\nThat said, Tesla is no stranger to long consolidation phases followed by explosive bull runs. Historically, the stock‚Äôs biggest rallies have come after extended periods of sideways action, and the current setup is starting to look like one of those moments. On Monday morning, shares broke decisively above a three-month consolidation range, a move that, if sustained, could mark the start of a significant bull run.\n\nFundamentally, two potential game-changers are on the horizon: the rollout of Tesla‚Äôs Optimus humanoid robot and the much-anticipated self-driving taxi business. Either could open entirely new revenue streams and spark renewed enthusiasm from investors, especially if early deployments impress.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that Tesla still carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating, reflecting near-term earnings estimate trends. However, technical action suggests the market‚Äôs tone toward the stock may be shifting. As long as shares hold above the breakout level around $338, the path of least resistance appears higher, with momentum traders likely to pile in.\n\nTradingView\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nShares of Meta Approach Another Record High\n\nMeta Platforms has enjoyed a remarkably smooth ride over the past year, steadily attracting buyers as both sales and profits continue to grow at an impressive pace.

The unusual arrangement is another example of a mega tech company acquiescing to the US administration‚Äôs demands, to gain an upper hand as trade relations are redrawn.\"\n\nFor the second quarter, Nvidia had previously guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2%.\n\nMetals One (MET1.L)\n\nLondon-listed minerals exploration company Metals One (MET1.L) emerged as the most-bought stock on Interactive Investor's July list, with shares up nearly 63% year-to-date.\n\nInteractive Investor's Hunt said: \"Somewhere towards the top of the risk spectrum are small exploration companies and one in particular has caught the eye of the most determined II customers\"\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nThe company currently has a market cap of ¬£34.63m and a share price of 7.08p, at the time of writing.\n\n\"Unknown in February when the shares traded at 2.4p, feverish speculation in May around a potential acquisition in Norway which would give the company access to gold, copper and nickel deposits, was followed by unsubstantiated claims from outside the company of a massive uranium find,\" said Hunter.\n\nDefence has remained a popular theme with investors, with FTSE 100-listed (^FTSE) Rolls-Royce (RR.L) appearing once more on Interactive Investor's most bought list.\n\nShares are up 91% year-to-date, lifting the company to a market cap of $90.8bn, though Hunter said this \"has not been enough to deter followers of the stock because of valuation concerns\".\n\nThe stock is now up 1069% on a five-year basis, with the most recent jump coming on the back of the company's half-year results, released in late July.\n\nRead more: Defence companies post strong results as UK investors back the sector over AI\n\nThe aero-engineer reported an underlying operating profit of ¬£1.76bn in the first half of the year, versus ¬£1.15bn a year ago.

With flying hours on the increase and with no signs of defence spending wavering, the story may yet have further to run.\"\n\nPalantir (PLTR)\n\nCombining both the themes of defence and AI is data software company Palantir (PLTR), which was among the top-traded stocks on the Robinhood UK platform in July.\n\nRobinhood UK's Lane said that Palantir \"rallied to new all-time highs in July, with a $100m government contract making the headlines, along with news of a new product in the works, designed to plan, build and review applications on the Palantir platform.\"\n\nShares are up 141% year-to-date, with the stock having risen on the back of its second-quarter earnings, released in early August.\n\nPalantir posted earnings per share of $0.16 for the quarter, beating consensus estimates of $0.14 and up 77% from the same period last year. Revenue came in at $1.004bn, Palantir's first quarter surpassing the billion-dollar mark on a quarterly basis. The company's top line also beat analyst forecasts for $939.25bn and was up 48% year-over-year.\n\nMost popular funds in July\n\nAs buoyant sentiment drove markets higher last month, investors continued to put money into US and global passive funds in June, giving them exposure to some of the world's biggest companies, such as the \"Magnificent 7\" tech behemoths.\n\nSam Benstead, fixed income lead at Interactive Investor, said: \"Looking at passives, low-cost, global funds were popular in July‚Äôs top 10, including Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index and HSBC FTSE All-World Index.

Clever CEOs are playing along, whether shareholders like it or not.\n\nExhibit A consists of Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which are basically buying export licenses from the Trump administration so they can sell semiconductors in China. Both companies have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from chip sales in China in exchange for the right to sell there.\n\n‚ÄúMy political head is spinning again with this new pay-to-play plan with Nvidia and AMD,‚Äù Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in an Aug. 11 analysis. ‚ÄúI pray for the sake of American free market capitalism that it stops here.\"\n\nThe Nvidia and AMD deals immediately bring to mind competitor Intel (INTC), which hasn‚Äôt yet agreed to cough up an export toll. Here‚Äôs a safe guess: It, too, will pay a similar fee for similar privileges.\n\nAt the moment, Intel is doing damage control. On Aug. 7, Trump directly attacked CEO Lip-Bu Tan, saying on social media that he ‚Äúmust resign, immediately.‚Äù Trump and some other Republicans seem to be concerned that Tan had improper connections with China‚Äôs military at another firm he ran until 2021.\n\nTan, a US citizen, now plans to meet with Trump to demonstrate his commitment to American interests, according to the Wall Street Journal.

He‚Äôll want something more tangible from Tan and Intel than reassurances. Trump‚Äôs favorite currency is money. Intel probably has no choice but to pay.\n\nNvidia‚Äôs 15% gratuity to the government for chip sales to China will cost the firm about $3 billion per year. The company‚Äôs stock dipped on the news, then drifted up. Investors may have first thought only of the bottom line, then decided the payment would be better than losing chip sales to China completely. The hit to AMD would be smaller because its China sales are lower. AMD stock also dipped then rose following the news. Intel stock rose on news of Tan‚Äôs chat with Trump, as buyers hope the company‚Äôs damage-control effort pays off.\n\nTrump has engineered this whole scenario. In April, Trump tightened restrictions on US chip sales to China, essentially blocking the sale of certain chips. Nvidia said that move would cost the company $5.5 billion in lost revenue. Then, in July, Trump reversed himself and decided to allow such chip sales to China.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T14:20:15.205938+00:00"}

Here is what might happen if things don't work out as investors hope.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/13/predict-stocks-worth-more-tesla-3-years-goog-tm/", "published_at": "2025-08-13T08:40:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Tesla stock has a wide range of future outcomes. Here is what might happen if things don't work out as investors hope.\n\nTesla (TSLA 0.54%) is one of the world's largest companies by market value, worth a little over $1 trillion today. The company is a pioneer in electric vehicles, autonomous driving software, and renewable energy, and is charging full steam into Robotaxis and humanoid robotics.\n\nAt face value, there is a lot to like about this technology company. But when you dig deeper, Tesla is far riskier as an investment, given its past success and massive valuation.\n\nSure, Tesla has a high ceiling, but it also has a very low floor. That's why I predict that Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) and Toyota Motor (TM 2.56%) will both be worth more than Tesla three years from now.\n\nIt's not as far-fetched as it sounds. Here is what you need to know.\n\nTesla's ambitious plans will likely take time, and that could spell near-term trouble\n\nThe narrative around Tesla is shifting from its legacy electric vehicle business to Robotaxi and humanoid robotics, which CEO Elon Musk and an increasing number of investors expect to carry the company's value moving forward.\n\nTesla's electric vehicle sales have started to decline, which could be at least partially due to Elon Musk's sometimes controversial, politicized persona. The issue here is that Tesla has only just begun launching its Robotaxi business, which is limited to a small number of vehicles with multiple safety measures in place. Tesla wants to expand its fleet rapidly, but that may take longer than most want to believe due to local and state-level regulations. Remember, Tesla's self-driving technology has still only obtained Level 2 capability, which mandates a human driver be present in the vehicle while it is autonomously operating.\n\nOptimus, Tesla's humanoid robot, is also still in early stages. While the company aims to build 5,000 Optimus units this year, reports indicate that Tesla is behind on that. Perhaps Optimus will someday generate the trillions of dollars in revenue Elon Musk believes it can, but Tesla has infamously established numerous timetables before that have failed to execute as promised.\n\nUnless Tesla can ramp Robotaxi and Optimus very quickly over the next year or so, the company's recent sales struggles could weigh significantly on the stock:\n\nOver the past few years, revenue growth ceased and then turned negative. Profit margins have cratered. If investors make Tesla a \"prove it\" story, the stock, trading at over 12 times revenue, could reasonably see at least 50% downside as its valuation shifts to more closely resemble that of an automotive manufacturer than a technology company.\n\nInvestors may not appreciate Toyota enough\n\nTake Toyota, for example, which is the world's most valuable legacy automotive company. Its revenue continues to grow to new highs, and its profit margin is far higher, clearing Tesla by over 3 percentage points. Ironically, Toyota has a market cap of just $246 billion, valuing the stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of less than 1.0, and a fraction of Tesla's.\n\nTo be fair to Tesla, I don't think it's likely that the stock's valuation drops all the way down to Toyota's level. The upside is too high if it delivers on Robotaxi and Optimus as investors hope -- even if it takes longer than expected.\n\nBut Toyota could surpass Tesla's value if the two meet somewhere in the middle. Using each's trailing-12-month revenue, Toyota's valuation would overtake Tesla's at a P/S ratio of 1, if Tesla's fell to about 3. This comparison is more about Tesla's downside than Toyota's upside, but it highlights Tesla's potential risks if the company doesn't follow through on some very ambitious goals.\n\nAlphabet is the true market leader in self-driving vehicles\n\nIt seems safe to say that Waymo is currently the leading autonomous ride-hailing company. That puts parent company Alphabet in the driver's seat.\n\nAlphabet, valued at over $2.3 trillion, is already worth more than Tesla, but some may not feel it will remain that way. Ark Invest's Cathie Wood believes that Tesla's value will skyrocket on Robotaxi growth. But I'm skeptical, at least of such a short time frame, for the reasons I walked through above. Additionally, Alphabet is a central player in artificial intelligence, with a blossoming cloud-computing business and digital advertising business that generates cash flow.\n\nSome might not associate Alphabet with self-driving vehicles. Yet Alphabet is arguably the perfect company to go after that market because it has such strong existing businesses that can fund the investments to develop a self-driving fleet and expand it across the United States. Waymo continues to announce new markets, and until Tesla and Robotaxi close the gap, it's hard not to like Alphabet's prospects better than Tesla's moving forward.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:41:40.428187+00:00"}

Looking at changes in supply and demand for various products and services can help you find promising careers, but why guess when the high earners will just tell you?\n\nA bunch of high earners debated which industries are growing the fastest, and five industries came out on top. These were some of the top picks.\n\nAI Governance\n\nOne of the top commenters works in cybersecurity and said that corporate AI governance is a growing industry. Other commenters agreed and cited the growth of Deep Fake technology as the main culprit. Deep Fake technology makes believable videos of people saying and doing things that they didn't actually say or do.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWould You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early? The Same Backers Are Betting on This Vacation Home Platform\n\n‚ÄòScrolling To UBI' ‚Äî Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\nThe Redditor believes AI governance and cybersecurity will grow in the foreseeable future. Artificial intelligence makes it easier for hackers to infiltrate databases, and that requires more defense. Corporate AI governance is one component of the cybersecurity industry.\n\nRobotics\n\nOne Redditor mentioned robotics as a high-growth industry that can replace blue-collar jobs. Tesla's humanoid robots are projected to be available in 2026, and the widespread adoption of this technology can create more jobs.\n\nLabor shortages and rising costs can also prompt businesses to invest in robots to replace labor. Many businesses can benefit from robots, and that results in a large addressable market. Elon Musk believes Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) humanoid robots can drive more than $10 trillion in revenue.\n\nTrending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion ‚Äì they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n\nNursing\n\nMost nursing jobs aren't optimal for work-life balance, but nursing shortages and the ongoing trend of boomers getting older paint a promising future for the industry. The Redditor who suggested nursing also said that there is no way to automate the industry. While tech can enhance the industry, nurses will always be needed.\n\nIncomes vary for nurses based on location, position, and other factors. One Redditor said that nursing doesn't qualify as a high-earning position, but another commenter said that nurses in their city can earn more than $200,000 per year if they work overtime.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:41:44.264615+00:00"}

However, this buzz has not translated into positive short-term share performance, indicated by the 4% decline in share price over the past month. Over a longer period, specifically the last year, Lucid's total shareholder return was 24.48% negative, underscoring ongoing challenges despite broad market gains. Over the same year, Lucid underperformed both the US market, which returned 19.4%, and the US Auto industry, which saw a 59% return. This clearly illustrates difficulties within the company's operational and competitive landscape.\n\nThe unveiling at Monterey Car Week, alongside its various partnerships and technological advances, is expected to bolster revenue potential through increased demand and expansions into the autonomous vehicle segment. The recently announced Uber partnership is particularly noteworthy for the potential revenue boost via licencing and fleet sales. Nonetheless, ongoing losses evidenced by negative earnings of US$3.06 billion and reliance on external funding emphasize significant hurdles in achieving profitability. Analysts forecast a revenue growth rate of 41.4% per year, despite persistent unprofitability within the next three years.\n\nThe current share price of US$2.19 reflects a cautionary stance relative to the consensus analyst price target of US$2.50, indicating potential upside of 13.31%. However, reaching this target would require substantial improvement in profitability and operational efficiency, as well as favorable market conditions.

The figure, disclosed in a court progress update, is still not final as more claims could surface. Since being appointed in January 2024, liquidators Edward Middleton and Tiffany Wong of Alvarez & Marsal have been combing through the company's maze of 3,000 legal entities and 1,300 ongoing projects across more than 280 cities. They have seized control of over 100 related companies worth HK$27 billion, but so far recoveries remain modest at $255 million, with only $167 million traceable back to Evergrande and even that sum may not be fully accessible due to complex ownership structures.\n\nOne area drawing heightened creditor interest is Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd., with its 3,000 projects considered a significant potential source of value. But jurisdictional barriers remain a key challenge, particularly with mainland assets falling under separate legal processes from Hong Kong. Onshore, Guangzhou Kailong Real Estate Co. fully owned by Evergrande and holding a 60% stake in Hengda Real Estate is now in bankruptcy proceedings. Last year, Chinese regulators accused Hengda of inflating over 560 billion yuan ($78 billion) in revenue through premature sales recognition, resulting in a 4.18 billion yuan fine. That penalty has further eroded the funds that could eventually reach offshore creditors.\n\nThe debt strain has also spilled into China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd., once ambitiously aiming to rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and at one point valued higher than Ford (NYSE:F). The EV arm is now under its own liquidation petition and has failed to attract new strategic investors after a prior deal fell apart. With hundreds of creditor actions in motion, no comprehensive restructuring plan in sight, and cross-border legal complexities slowing asset recovery, the road ahead for Evergrande's stakeholders remains long and uncertain.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:41:52.964117+00:00"}

Given this is a capital-intensive industry that‚Äôs seen several promising startups, like TuSimple and Embark, crash and burn, efficiency can be a major advantage.\n\nSince it was founded in 2021, Waabi has raised $287.7 million in total, the bulk of which came from a $200 million Series B in 2024. Urtasun claims the company doesn‚Äôt need to raise more to get to its next phase of growth.\n\nThe startup‚Äôs chief competitor is Aurora, which this year launched the first commercial driverless trucking route in the U.S., and has raised nearly $3.46 billion through a combination of venture capital and its public listing.\n\nWaabi has managed to launch commercial pilots quickly because it does most training, testing, and validation in Waabi World, its closed-loop simulator that both virtually tests the self-driving software and teaches it in real time. More recently, Waabi took its simulator to the test track, overlaying virtual environments onto real-world driving conditions to simulate scenarios like accidents and construction zones without the actual risk, according to Urtasun.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:41:56.746392+00:00"}

The joke refers to one of the pains of owning the groundbreaking Model T, widely considered the first automobile affordable to a wide swath of Americans. To start one, you needed to use a laborious hand crank.\n\nOn Monday, well over a century later, Ford promised a new ‚ÄúModel T moment‚Äù for electric vehicles (EVs). The company said it is investing $2 billion to build a new EV platform and manufacture an affordable EV truck ‚Äî retailing at $30,000, thanks to the kind of efficient, simplified manufacturing at the heart of the Model T‚Äôs automotive revolution ‚Äî that will roll out in 2027. If successful, the company believes it could transform EV adoption in America, no exhausting hand crank required.\n\nAn Electrified Blast from the Past\n\nFord has taken something of a backseat in its broader adoption of EVs, with the pricey F-150 Lightning and the electric Mustang as its two most prominent offerings. At Ford‚Äôs Louisville assembly plant on Monday, CEO Jim Farley said the exponential growth of Chinese companies like BYD and Geely through affordable EV options, and increasingly price‚Äìfriendly EVs from US and European competitors, meant his company ‚Äúneeded a radical approach‚Äù to stake out its own territory. Ford‚Äôs money-losing EV business ‚Äî which posted $2.2 billion in losses in the first half of 2025 ‚Äî could no doubt use the jumpstart.\n\nThis ‚ÄúModel T‚Äù moment didn‚Äôt happen overnight. Farley last year tasked a secretive ‚Äúskunkworks‚Äù team in Long Beach, California, with developing ‚Äúa new generation‚Äù of affordable EVs, not unlike the secretive team founder Henry Ford set up to develop streamlined production of the Model T:\n\nThe $30,000 EV truck will be the first in a line of affordable battery-powered models that Ford said will take 40% less time to build and need 600 fewer workers than its hybrid-electric crossover SUV, the Escape, which is set to be discontinued after this year. Those efficiencies are thanks to the ‚Äúskunkworks‚Äù team, led by former leading Tesla engineer Alan Clarke, with its new line of vehicles slated to be built at the Louisville plant, which will be converted to manufacture EVs with the $2 billion investment.\n\nFord said its new EV platform will vastly reduce the number of components needed in manufacturing: 20% fewer parts than a typical vehicle and 25% fewer fasteners, translating to fewer workstations in the plant and a 15% reduction in assembly time. The batteries for the new line of EVs will come from a new $3 billion factory in Michigan.\n\n‚ÄúWe believe the only way to really compete effectively with the Chinese over the globe on EVs is to go and really push ourselves to radically re-engineer and transform our engineering supply chain and manufacturing process,‚Äù Farley said. He boasted that the midsize EV pickup will cost less than a Tesla Model Y and have more room than a Toyota RAV4.\n\nWriters Room Challenge: The Model T, which was produced from 1908 to 1927, did a great deal for comedy beyond Buster Keaton, frequently playing for laughs in silent film-era staples by the likes of Laurel & Hardy and Charlie Chaplin. Maybe we‚Äôre in for a run of Ford EV truck-themed Netflix capers.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:42:06.682810+00:00"}

But Uber stock fell following an earnings call with analysts that focused on the company's strategy to compete against robotaxis from Waymo and Tesla (TSLA).\n\nUber said it earned an adjusted 63 cents per share for the June-ended quarter, up 34% from a year earlier. That was in-line with what analysts polled by FactSet were forecasting. Sales increased 18% to $12.65 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $12.47 billion.\n\nGross bookings value across Uber's rides and food-delivery business grew 17% to $46.76 billion for the quarter, exceeding estimates of $46.42 billion.\n\n\"Our platform strategy is working, with record audience, frequency and profitability across mobility and delivery,\" Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a news release. \"But we're still only beginning to unlock the platform's full potential, now with 20 autonomous partners around the world.\"\n\nUber also offered a third-quarter outlook that exceeded expectations. Uber guided for gross bookings value of $49 billion at the midpoint of its range. Analysts were looking for total bookings of $47.5 billion for the September-ending period.\n\nOn the stock market today, Uber stock slipped more than 1% to 88.36 in late morning trades.\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Ralph Schackart reiterated an outperform call for Uber stock following the report.\n\nUber stock's decline Wednesday is \"likely the result of high expectations into the quarter, and perhaps investors were looking for more definitive answers on (autonomous vehicles), which is difficult to provide at this point, in our view, given AV is still nascent,\" Schackart said in a client note. \"However, the business continues to perform well with strong momentum, and it continues to post strong growth at scale.\"\n\nUber's Robotaxi Strategy\n\nAnalysts asked Uber's leadership several questions about autonomous vehicles on a conference call early Wednesday ‚Äî continuing a trend of longer-term robotaxi concerns overshadowing Uber's current business performance.\n\nUber has been racing to partner up with robotaxi providers as a ride-hail service from Waymo and a recently launched effort from Tesla compete for share in some U.S. cities. Uber is working with Waymo in Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta but has been left out from some of Waymo's more recent expansions.\n\nOne question noted that there are \"investor concerns\" about Uber's plan to invest $300 million in Lucid (LCID) to launch a line of self-driving vehicles. The plan, announced last month, also includes investments in the startup Nuro, which is developing the self-driving technology. Uber stock fell after it announced the plan.\n\nKhosrowshahi said Uber benefits when there is more supply, or vehicles, available. Uber is using some of its resources to act as a \"catalyst\" to get more autonomous vehicles into the market, Khosrowshahi told analysts.\n\n\"As you see with our cash flow and our capital allocation, we can afford to invest aggressively in the autonomous space and at the same time to return plenty of capital to our shareholders,\" Khosrowshahi said.\n\nLater in the call, Khosrowshahi said the Waymo partnership is performing well in Austin and is showing good early results in Atlanta. He said he'd \"love to have more Waymos\" on Uber but declined to say whether that is likely to happen.\n\nBut while Waymo is the early U.S. leader, Khosrowshahi said he expects autonomous vehicles will not be a \"winner take all\" market.\n\nUber Stock Rebounding In 2025\n\nUber shares initially wavered following the release of the report Wednesday morning. But the slide in morning trading is now pushing shares back below their 50-day moving average, after Uber reclaimed that key level Tuesday.\n\nAfter slumping to close out 2024, Uber stock has bounced back with a 49% gain so far this year, as of Tuesday's close. Shares pulled back by 6% in July but had steadied to start August.\n\nComing into the report, Uber stock held an IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

The starting point was $100 billion‚Äîa multiple of its market cap at the time. If Musk reached the max of $650 billion, a number that seemed wildly improbable at the time, he‚Äôd amass 12% of Tesla‚Äôs stock. The framework resembled the process of opening a safety-deposit box; getting a new 1% required two ‚Äúkeys‚Äù: first, hitting the valuation bogey and second, achieving 12 of 18 combined goals for revenues and Ebitda. The top Ebitda target was $14 billion, and the highest sales figure $175 billion.\n\nThe directors‚Äô objective is obviously to keep Musk in charge, enhancing the chances he‚Äôll deliver big-time on his promises for forthcoming, not yet commercial, robotaxis, self-driving software, and humanoid robots. But for Tesla holders who are starting to lose faith as the gauzy pledges come and go unkept, the plan‚Äôs structure, to use the clich√© so often found in CEO comp plans, ‚Äúaligns‚Äù Musk‚Äôs fate to their own far more tightly than did the first program.\n\nNaturally, the deal only applies if Musk and Tesla lose on appeal. If that happens, under the new iteration he‚Äôd receive a restricted stock grant of 96 million shares at a strike price of $23.34, equivalent to the figure when he got the gigantic trove at the start of 2018. At Tesla‚Äôs current price of roughly $309, those shares would be worth over $27 billion. Here are the restrictions: The shares vest on the second anniversary of the grant, or early August 2027, but only if Musk serves that entire period as either CEO or chief of product development or operations. In addition, he can‚Äôt sell any of those vested shares until five years from the date of the award, or Aug. 3, 2030.\n\nRecall that in 2024, in response to a lawsuit from the EV maker‚Äôs shareholders, the Delaware courts invalidated the famous giga-grant approved in January of 2018. Musk and the company appealed the ruling, and the decision is now on appeal. The Tesla board stepped in to ensure that if the Tesla side loses, the CEO will get something similar to the numbers he‚Äôd sacrifice. But this time, they‚Äôre attaching a series of wise conditions absent the first time around.\n\nThe new ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù pay package that Tesla unveiled for Elon Musk on Aug. 3 marks a big improvement over its predecessor, for a basic reason. It guarantees what the previous version left open‚Äîthe very real possibility that if Tesla‚Äôs stock takes a giant roundtrip back to the price where they gave Musk that huge slug, shareholders get nothing but dilution for the directors‚Äô largesse. And Musk still holds shares worth billions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWithin a mere three and half years‚Äîby mid-2021‚ÄîMusk rang the bell. He first surpassed the $650 billion market cap max, and later scored all the Ebitda benchmarks and supplemented that accomplishment by reaching an intermediate sales bogey of $75 billion, good enough overall to satisfy the 12 operating metrics requirement. Hence, Musk got the full windfall.\n\nThe concept‚Äôs big flaw: Musk kept making big vows for incredibly profitable new products that wowed investors. That helped send the stock skyward, helping him achieve the valuation part. The revenue and Ebitda requirements were relatively easy to hit. So the combination of rhetorically inflating the stock price and not having to deliver fabulous basic profitability numbers won the day.\n\nTo be fair, Tesla‚Äôs cap at almost $1 trillion is still three times its level when Musk received his average 1% stock grant, and 50% above where he got his last piece at $650 billion. The problem: It‚Äôs impossible to get any idea of what Tesla‚Äôs really worth in the long run. And if it turns out to be mainly a metal-bending car company, or if the capex requirements needed to build out Musk‚Äôs visionary businesses, as well as heavy competition, make them marginally profitable, Tesla‚Äôs value could fall back to something like where it stood when Musk captured the then seemingly mission impossible package at the start of 2018, when Tesla shares traded at $23.34.\n\nUnder the new deal, if Tesla‚Äôs stock tanks big-time, Musk doesn‚Äôt get paid\n\nThe original plan had a major weakness. Musk got his 12% of the stock upfront. So even if shares dropped all the way back to the original strike price of $23.34, putting Tesla‚Äôs market cap at $75 billion, he‚Äôd still own $9 billion in shares (12% of $75 billion). And the shareholders would have endured big dilution, and gotten zip for it.\n\nBut the new plan ensures that can‚Äôt happen. Is it absolutely impossible that Tesla drops that far? Not at all. Just look at its current fundamentals. The original plan only made sense if Tesla reached the operating goals stipulated to trigger the grants, and kept ramping revenues and profits swiftly from there. In other words, the fundamentals had to grow into the valuation. Musk was essentially getting paid for great things to come.\n\nThat didn‚Äôt happen. In the first two quarters of this year, Tesla‚Äôs sales ran at an annual rate of $84 billion, just above the bogey of $75 billion Musk hit a few years back. In the same six months, its Ebitda was stuck at $12 billion on a yearly basis, below the $14 billion number that unlocked the payout.\n\nI recently wrote a piece on the ‚ÄúMusk Magic Premium‚Äù that calculated what Tesla is worth based on its current products, and the extra value awarded for Musk‚Äôs visionary pledges‚Äîthat‚Äôs the premium. To get the core, repeatable earnings number for today‚Äôs EVs and batteries, I remove accounting gains or losses on its Bitcoin holdings, and subtract sales of regulatory credits that will probably now die owing to Trump‚Äôs recent pulling of penalties for the automakers who stop buying them.\n\nFor the past four quarters, that ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù number is $3.3 billion. Imagine that Musk raises that figure at a decent 8% a year, so that net earnings reach $5.4 billion in 2030, the year Musk is free to sell shares under the new program (if it happens). Let‚Äôs also assume that since it‚Äôs a low-growth manufacturer, Tesla warrants a P/E that‚Äôs well above the auto industry average at 14. Then it would be worth $75 billion five years hence.\n\nThat result would put the shares right back near Musk‚Äôs strike price of $23.34. His big grant would be worthless, while under the old one, he‚Äôd still have stock worth $9 billion. Even if Tesla‚Äôs shares drop to around $50 and its cap stands at roughly $150 billion, Musk would make a lot less, around $2.5 billion. Yes, it‚Äôs a good thing that the Tesla board is forcing Musk to wait a long time to get paid. Five years from now, we‚Äôll be able to see what all those promises are really worth. If they‚Äôre exhaust from a tailpipe, shareholders will suffer big-time. But Elon Musk will suffer along with them.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:42:27.105067+00:00"}

It alleges the named defendants committed securities fraud by failing to disclose the risks associated with the EV maker‚Äôs autonomous vehicle technology, including robotaxis, and that, ‚Äúaccordingly, Tesla‚Äôs business and/or financial prospects were overstated,‚Äù the complaint reads. ‚ÄúAs a result, the Company‚Äôs public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.‚Äù\n\nBy failing to disclose such risks, the three defendants participated in a scheme to ‚Äúdeceive the investing public‚Äù and ‚Äúartificially inflate and maintain the market price of Tesla securities. Specifically, the complaint alleges ‚Äúdefendants Kirkhorn and Taneja enriched themselves by engaging in insider sales of the shares while those shares traded at artificially high prices.‚Äù During the period in question, Kirkhorn sold approximately 7,403 shares of Tesla stock with a value of at least $1.59 million, while Taneja sold about 8,192 shares of Tesla stock for at least $2.51 million, according to the complaint.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBoth Kirkhorn and Taneja have reaped multi-million dollar pay packages during their respective tenures as finance chief for the Austin, Texas-based EV maker. Kirkhorn departed from the EV maker in 2023 with a $590 million pay package, after a 13-year tenure with Tesla that included four years in its top financial seat, CFO Dive reported at the time.\n\nTaneja, meanwhile, who succeeded Kirkhorn as CFO in 2023, has made repeated sales of company stock over the past year, most recently offloading approximately $1.7 million in shares across transactions on July 7 and 8 after selling more than $3 million in shares in June, CFO Dive reported. This came after Taneja‚Äôs compensation for full-year 2024 reached $139 million, largely comprised of stock and equity awards.\n\nThe complaint comes as the EV maker‚Äôs efforts to move forward with autonomous driving technology have hit repeated setbacks. On Aug. 1, the EV maker was ordered to pay more than $240 million to the victims of a 2019 crash related to its autopilot technology by a Florida jury, according to a report by The Guardian. The company also remains embroiled in a regulatory tug-of-war with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which has claimed the EV maker exaggerated the capabilities of its self-driving technology, according to a July 21 report by Bloomberg.\n\nMusk has repeatedly championed the potential of Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi and similar technologies, a long-time passion project for the EV maker‚Äôs CEO. During the company‚Äôs most recent earnings call ‚Äî where Tesla saw a 12% dip in revenue year-over-year, as well as 42% YoY dip in operating income ‚Äî Musk was optimistic about Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi prospects, despite warning there might be some ‚Äúrough quarters‚Äù ahead for the business, CFO Dive previously reported.The company‚Äôs robotaxi pilot, launched in Austin, Texas in June, is a ‚Äúseminal point‚Äù for the business, he said, while also stressing the company is ‚Äúbeing paranoid about safety.‚Äù\n\nMonday‚Äôs shareholder complaint alleges Musk and his fellow defendants made repeated false or repeated statements regarding the safety of its autonomous driving services, and pointed to a June Bloomberg article, published shortly after the launch of the robotaxi pilot, which appears to show robotaxis disobeying traffic laws. The defendants also failed to disclose risks that such vehicles would ‚Äúoperate dangerously and/or in violation of traffic laws,‚Äù as well as the corresponding likelihood that Telsa would become ‚Äúsubject to heightened regulatory scrutiny.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never actually investors.

The first half of the year was affected by supplier issues and the lack of magnets from places like China (which also affected rival Rivian (RIVN)), but Winteroff said those issues are behind them.\n\nA wrench in Lucid's plans is the loss of the federal EV tax credit, but the company said it is able to hit its production and sales goals.\n\n\"We are expecting a pull forward in demand now in Q3 and then, you know, softening in Q4, mainly for the Air sedan, not so much for the Gravity, but in general, also for that [too].

JPM has a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.32x, which is significantly lower than the S&P 500‚Äôs 24.84x. As tech valuations get more and more stretched, JPM could be a beneficiary of a rotational pullback in high valuation names.\n\nJPM CEO Jamie Dimon is the longest-sitting CEO at a major bank (he has been CEO since 2006) ‚Äì and for good reason. While the macroeconomic environment has been unpredictable and challenging over the past few years, JPM has delivered positive earnings beats versus Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates in twelve consecutive quarters.\n\nWhile betting markets anticipate that Powell and the Fed will cut interest rates in September, a gradual rate-cutting-cycle should be a net positive for JPM as lower rates can stimulate the market (more M&A & IPOs). In other words, the company will still enjoy fairly robust NII while other sides of the business gain steam.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs monetary policy stance has been a political ‚Äòhot button‚Äô topic. However, JPM is one of the companies benefiting from the current interest rate levels. With rates near multi-year highs, JPM benefits from higher Net Interest Income (NII), which is the spread between what a bank earns on loans and what it pays out in deposits.\n\nHeadquartered in New York, NY, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock JPMorgan is one of the largest global banks with assets worth ~$5 trillion. With its iconic CEO Jamie Dimon at the helm, JPM has grown into one of the largest financial service firms globally, with operations in more than 60 countries. JPM has four major segments under its umbrella, including:\n\nChicago, IL ‚Äì August 6, 2025 ‚Äì Zacks Equity Research shares JPMorgan JPM as the Bull of the Day and Carter‚Äôs Inc. CRI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on General Motors GM, Ford F and Tesla TSLA .\n\nStory continues\n\nJPM‚Äôs Aggressive Growth Strategy\n\nJPMorgan is expanding its global banking footprint aggressively, with plans to open more than 500 new banking branches over the next two years. This move will solidify its position as the most extensive banking network, allowing the company to boost market share and benefit from cross-selling and network effects.\n\nBottom Line\n\nJPMorgan‚Äôs reasonable valuation, its consistent earnings, and its ability to capitalize on favorable interest rate environments set the stock up for continued outperformance.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nHeadquartered in Atlanta, GA, Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Carter‚Äôs Inc. is the largest seller of branded apparel and baby-related products. Notably, the company runs a portfolio of popular brands, including Carter‚Äôs, OshKoshB‚Äôgosh, Just One You, Child of Mine, Simple Joys, Skip Hop, and Precious Firsts. CRI sells its products through leading department stores, national chains, and specialty retailers, both domestically and internationally. The company sells through retail partners like Amazon, Walmart, Targetand Macy‚Äôs.\n\nDeclining Birthrate a Long-term Headwind for Carter‚Äôs\n\nThe US birthrate has been declining consistently for the past seven decades. However, as economic conditions, social, and cultural winds shift, the birthrate in the United States has shrunk even further. Meanwhile, widespread access to contraception has also weighed on the birthrate. Because Carter‚Äôs is focused on the baby segment, this is a troubling long-term headwind with no end in sight for CRI investors.\n\nCRI Suffers Amid Weak Consumer Trends, Suspends Guidance\n\nCarter‚Äôs, like others in the industry, has been witnessing the impacts of a challenging macroeconomic environment, which is affecting its top-line performance. In addition, the current tariff environment has introduced significant uncertainty, making it difficult to predict the company‚Äôs future financial performance. As a result, Carter‚Äôs has decided to suspend providing guidance until there is more clarity on the internal operational direction and external market conditions. The company also cited a highly volatile retail landscape, ongoing macroeconomic pressures, and foreign currency headwinds, particularly in its international markets, as added factors contributing to the lack of forward visibility. Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that EPS growth will continue to plunge into 2026.\n\nDriven by the continuation of these trends, Carter‚Äôs first-quarter 2025 sales declined 4.8% from $661.5 million posted in the year-ago period. The decline was due to macroeconomic pressures, including inflation, elevated interest rates, and weakening consumer confidence, which reduced demand across segments. We note that the company‚Äôs shares have exhibited relative weakness, losing 49.9% in the past six months compared with the industry‚Äôs 43.4% decline.\n\nCRI Faces Tariff Headwinds\n\nCarter‚Äôs faces significant tariff pressures, with proposed increases on imports into the U.S. adding to existing duties, which amounted to approximately $110 million in 2024. These rising tariffs, particularly on products manufactured in Asia, are impacting cost structures, especially given that less than 5% of baby apparel is produced in the Western Hemisphere. While the company has actively engaged in lobbying efforts and evaluated nearshoring alternatives in Latin America, high labor costs and limited infrastructure in the region make it challenging to offset the tariff burden effectively.\n\nBottom Line\n\nA falling birthrate, weak consumer trends, and a negative outlook are all reasons to avoid baby retailer Carter‚Äôs.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nAfter a Hot July for GM EV Sales, Is the Stock Still a Buy?\n\nGeneral Motors sold more than 19,000 electric vehicles (EVs) last month, up a whopping 115% year over year. The surge was largely led by strong demand for the Chevrolet Equinox EV model. The US legacy automaker is advancing well in its electrification journey, thanks to its robust portfolio, including 13 models across its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac brands.\n\nGeneral Motors was the second-largest EV seller in the United States last year, just behind Tesla and managed to keep up the momentum through the first half of 2025. General Motors‚Äô EV sales in the last reported quarter more than doubled. Meanwhile, GM‚Äôs closest peer, Ford, witnessed more than a 30% drop in second-quarter EV sales year over year. EV giant Tesla recorded a 13.4% decline in deliveries in the three months ending June.\n\nWhile General Motors' EV sales have been impressive, it will be interesting to watch if the company can sustain its sales growth amid policy shifts and U.S. President Trump‚Äôs unfriendly stance on e-mobility. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the company‚Äôs fundamentals to assess if General Motors is worth buying at the moment.\n\nGM Maintains EPS Beat Streak in Q2 Despite Tariffs\n\nGeneral Motors‚Äô second-quarter 2025 earnings beat was its 12th straight quarterly beat. Strong vehicle demand and stable vehicle pricing led to record first-half 2025 revenues of $91 billion. GMNA (General Motors North America) segment revenues were also a first-half record at roughly $77 billion.\n\nThe company was hit with $1.1 billion in net tariffs in the last reported quarter, although EPS of $2.53 exceeded expectations by 6%. However, GM expects net tariff costs in the third quarter to be higher than in the second quarter. It stuck to its guidance of gross tariff impact of $4-$5 billion for the full year but expects to offset roughly 30% of that through strategic initiatives like cost cuts, stable pricing and production adjustments. GM reaffirmed its adjusted EBIT forecast for the full year between $10 billion and $12.5 billion.\n\nGeneral Motors Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | General Motors Company Quote\n\nFactors Favoring General Motors\n\nIn the first half of the year, GM‚Äôs U.S. market share climbed to 17.3%, up 1.2 percentage points from the same period last year ‚Äî a steady, positive trend. The company continues to expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint and domestic supply chain, while also investing heavily in battery, software, and autonomous vehicle innovation. Internationally, GM is making meaningful progress. In China, it‚Äôs working closely with its joint venture partner to improve sales, streamline inventory and boost profitability.\n\nThe strong performance of its new energy vehicles is also boosting results. Chevrolet has emerged as the number two EV brand in the United States, thanks to the success of the Blazer EV and Equinox EV. Meanwhile, Cadillac became the fifth-largest EV brand in the last reported quarter. GM is also scaling its hands-free driving system, Super Cruise. The technology is on track to generate over $200 million in revenues in 2025, with expectations to more than double by 2026.\n\nThe company‚Äôs investor-friendly moves also augur well. It completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2025, retiring 10 million more shares. This brings the total shares bought back under that program to 43 million. Notably, GM resumed open market buybacks in early July.\n\nGM‚Äôs Performance & Valuation\n\nOver the past three months, shares of General Motors have risen 16%, outperforming the industry as well as Ford and Tesla, which gained 5% and 12%, respectively.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, General Motors appears relatively undervalued. The stock trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 0.29, well below the industry‚Äôs 2.64. GM also boasts a Value Score of A. In comparison, Tesla and Ford trade at a P/S ratio of 9.7 and 0.27, respectively.\n\nWhy Buying GM Stock Isn‚Äôt a Good Idea Now\n\nWhile GM continues to make strides in EVs and innovation, near-term headwinds are worth noting. Fleet pricing has come under pressure due to rising competition, and this trend is expected to persist in the second half of the year. GM also flagged higher warranty costs, particularly for the L87 powertrain and early EV software issues, which will be a drag in 2025.\n\nCapital spending remains high and can weigh on free cash flow. While the company expects 2025 capex to be in the range of $10‚Äì$11 billion, the figure is expected to rise slightly to $10‚Äì$12 billion in 2026 and 2027 as GM ramps up production and future model launches.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM‚Äôs 2025 EPS and sales implies a year-over-year decline of 11% and 4.3%, respectively.\n\nAdjusted EBIT for the first half of the year came in at $6.5 billion. Based on full-year guidance, second-half earnings are expected to be about $1.75 billion lower at the midpoint of the outlook. This is essentially due to three reasons. First, tariffs will remain a burden. Second, the company expects lower wholesale volumes in North America. Lastly, increased spending to prepare for the rollout of next-gen full-size trucks and the expansion of U.S. EV capacity will also weigh on the results.\n\nAdditionally, EV profitability may take a hit from softening demand because of the phase-out of government incentives like the federal tax credit. Given these headwinds, this isn‚Äôt the best time for new investors to jump in.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Travis Hoium joined by longtime fools, Lou the Legend Whiteman, and from a vacation that never ends. Rachel Warren. Today we're going to get to earnings from Spotify and get a pulse on the consumer. Let's start with Tesla. We learned this week that Samsung's new fab in Texas is going to be making Tesla's AI six Chip. This follows AI 5, which is being fabbed by TSMC. AI 6 is going to be used for humanoid robots, cars, and even AI data centers. Tesla could spend over 16.5 billion dollar on these chips, and Elon Musk is going to get to walk the line, making sure it's efficient, something Samsung apparently can't do itself. Rachel, what does this say about Tesla and Samsung's chip ambitions?\n\nRachel Warren: Well, what's interesting about this is that Samsung didn't name the counterparty in its filing. They cited a request from that second party to protect trade secrets. But they said the effective start date of the contract was July of this year. Its end date is in 2033, and then Elon Musk later confirmed in a reply to a post on X that Tesla was, in fact, the counterparty. But I think this deal is great news for both companies for different reasons. Samsung definitely needs this deal, in my view. The partnership provides a much needed anchor client for Samsung's new semiconductor fabrication facility in Taylor, Texas. That could also validate their investment in US based chip manufacturing and potentially attract other clients. Samsung has been facing serious challenges due to increased competition, particularly in the memory chip market, and they've really been struggling to keep up with the demand for advanced AI chips.\n\nTheir logic chip business has also faced challenges and in foundry services, which is manufacturing chips for other companies, they are behind TSMC. Now, for Tesla's part, it's gaining greater control over a crucial element of its AI infrastructure. It's diversifying its supply chain, and it's reducing reliance on a single manufacturer. That could mitigate a range of potential future risks and ensure a more stable supply of critical components. And finally, it positions Tesla to maintain a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving AI and automotive landscape. It suggests that they're planning for future generations of AI chips that could ensure a pipeline of advanced technology for years to come.\n\nTravis Hoium: Lou, I have lots of questions about how many chips Tesla is going to need going forward for vehicles, robots, and those AI data centers because a lot of those products just frankly, don't exist yet. But US chip manufacturing does seem to be booming. The TSMC plant in Arizona, going through another addition, their costs actually seem to be sort of under control there. It's not as expensive as they feared. Has the US chip tide shifted over the past couple of years?\n\nLou Whiteman: Fun fact, lost in a narrative, but the US has more semiconductor plants than Taiwan. The US is second only to Japan in terms of semi production and that's been true for a while. Context matters, though? Taiwan, thanks to its national champion, Taiwan Semi, and their deals with Nvidia, all of these AI players, they have a strong share of the cutting edge chips used in AI. Obviously, that's the focus, so that's what we're looking at. I don't think we can say the tide has shifted. It's way too early to raise the mission accomplished banner. The US is making steady progress, and this deal is definitely part of that progress. But, look, we are still very reliant on Taiwan for those high powered AI chips, and that hasn't shifted. That's still true.\n\nTravis Hoium: If these chips do their job, hopefully one of these humanoid robots can do my laundry or mow the lawn for me sometime in the near future. Let's move on to earnings. You may be listening to this podcast on Spotify, so we should probably check in on their earnings. Revenue for the second quarter of 2025 was up 10% to 4.2 billion euros. Free cash flow was 700 million euros. That's a huge improvement from a few years ago, but the stock was down as much as 12% on Tuesday. Lou, was this really a disappointing quarter?\n\nLou Whiteman: Relative to expectations, yes, but I think it is important to look at the big picture here. Yes, revenue missed estimates, and, yes, the company posted an unexpected loss. But if you look at it, the revenue miss was mostly due to about 100 million euros worth of currency fluctuation losses. Back that out, back out just the currency conversion noise and revenue is basically in line, which is much better. On the earning side, there were some higher personnel costs. There is some cost creep, but much of the loss was tied to what they call social charges, which is basically stock based compensation. Back all this out. It's worth noting that the underlying numbers how the business is doing looked a lot better. Free cash flow is up 43% to 700 million euros. The all important number of premium subscribers continues to grow up 12% to 276 million. There are no signs of distress here. There are no signs of worry. This is still a very, very good operating business. They just got caught up in some accounting things.\n\nRachel Warren: Yeah. These results warrant the stock dropping and having its worst trading day in two years? I think that might be a bit of a market overreaction. But it does also fit in with the types of market movements we've seen in recent earning seasons. When a company misses on maybe a couple key metrics. Even if the overall picture remains positive, as it does, in my view, for Spotify. CEO Daniel Eche acknowledged that the company's ad supported revenue growth. It's been slower than anticipated. And he attributed that to execution challenges rather than actual strategic issues. It's worth noting that their ad supported revenue declined by about 1% year over year in the quarter. But revenue from premium subscribers actually rose 12% from one year ago. It's also worth noting monthly active users grew 11% year over year to 696 million.\n\nThat means that Spotify added 18 million monthly active users in Q2 versus the guidance they had previously given for 11 million. And they also achieved premium subscriber net additions of 8 million, which far exceeded their guidance of 3 million. You also saw gross margin rise to 31.5%, and a lot of that was attributable to premium revenue growth outpacing music costs, as well as improved contributions from areas like podcasts and music. Spotify is expecting continued strong user and subscriber growth. Going into Q3, they're looking to achieve as many as 710 million monthly active users and 281 million premium subscribers. They had about 8.4 billion euros of liquidity on hand, as well, at the end of the quarter. I still think this is a solid business.\n\nTravis Hoium: Yeah, they talked a lot about improving that ad business on the conference call. We'll see if they can do that in the future. For some context, Spotify stock is up 385% in the past three years, even after yesterday's drop. But the price of sales multiple is up 240%. A lot of multiple expansion there. When stocks go up, expectations rise, and sometimes even a good report isn't enough to impress investors. I think that's the big story. Next up, we're going to talk coffee and credit cards, get a glimpse of how the consumers doing. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nThe biggest question this time of year is what is the consumer feeling? How healthy are they? Last week, banks said that consumers were doing fine. Late on Tuesday, we heard from visa Starbucks and booking.com. Lou, let's start with visa because they have the widest view of the economy overall. What did we learn?\n\nLou Whiteman: Visa topped expectations, grew adjusted earnings by 23%. But as you say, the big news, CEO Ryan McNern's comments about the consumer, that's what really stood out. He called the consumer spending resilient, even non discretionary, which I found interesting. He also said it has remained so past the end of the quarter into July. So, all as well, great news. But it is worth noting, Travis, that even with this perceived strength, Visa held guidance steady for the rest of the year. No beaten race here. It appears they're at least hedging their bets a bit or at least a little worried. Definitely not sounding the alarm, but I'm still curious about what's going on and what will go on in the months to come.\n\nTravis Hoium: Rachel, this one shocked me. Starbucks stock is down over the past six years. That's really a turnaround story right now. Brian Nichol has been brought in to change the direction of the business. Are we seeing progress from their recent results?\n\nRachel Warren: This is definitely a period of transition for the business for Starbucks, and the turnaround is taking time. This is really evidenced by the fact that Starbucks reported that same store sales fell for a sixth straight quarter in their recent report. GAAP earnings per share of $0.49 actually declined 47% year over year. That's a couple of those facts, but we are seeing progress. For example, their net revenue of 9.5 billion dollar in their fiscal third quarter. That exceeded analyst expectations of 9.3 billion in the recent quarter. It was also up 4% year over year. Notably, Starbucks saw its first sales gain in China since 2023 with a 2% increase in comparable store sales, and that was driven by a 6% increase in transactions. Now, we've heard reports that Starbucks is weighing a sale of its China business. That remains to be seen. But this was also the third consecutive quarter of improvements in US transaction comp, although we're still seeing negative growth there. Now Barista turnover is at its lowest since the pandemic. Starbucks is investing an additional $500 million in labor hours for US stores over the next year. It's looking to really improve its customer service and store operations. Finally, Starbucks just announced that they're going to be introducing a new stand-alone store prototype in 2026 with a drive through and more seating. That could be interesting to watch, as well.\n\nTravis Hoium: Yeah. These numbers coming out from restaurants and fast food chains or coffee chains are all over the place. I'm really having a hard time. Chipotle's quarter was a little bit weak. The same store sales comps were down. It just seems very company specific right now. Let's go to our final one of the day. That's booking.com. Fun fact, over the last 20 years, booking stock is up 22,407%. Just a phenomenal run. They reported last night after the market closed, results were solid, but outlook was weak. What's going on, Lou?\n\nLou Whiteman: Yeah. Just an amazing company and a big winner over the years for Motley fool members, so really, really fun to watch. As you say, a really solid quarter came in ahead of estimates, but they did set profit guidance slightly below expectations. I'm going to emphasize slightly here because at the midpoint, they see revenue of 8.63 billion in the current quarter, which is maybe $60,000,000 short of consensus, which is funny that that could cause a sell off. But Travis, you mentioned it before with Spotify, I think the same is true of booking. Great company, great quarter holding up very well in what we thought maybe could be a tricky environment, but there were so much expectations baked into the stock it just had to let off a little steam post earnings. As a long term holder, I don't see much reason to worry about this quarter, even if the stock did sell off.\n\nRachel Warren: Yeah. The company exceeded analyst estimates for Q2 revenue and earnings per share. But it's Q3 guidance for revenue as well as room night growth was lower than anticipated. The market probably also didn't love that double digit decline in earnings, but a lot of this goes back to near term investments the company's making in its platform that are putting pressure on the bottom line. This deceleration of growth, even from strong absolute levels, seems to be scaring some investors. Some might believe the travel boom following the pandemic could be reaching a plateau or perhaps are concerned about a weakening macro environment. This is still a fundamentally well financially bolstered business. Room nights in this recent quarter grew 8% compared to one year ago. Gross bookings were up 13% year over year. Revenue rose 16%.\n\nThey also reached a major milestone with their connected trip transactions on the flagship booking.com platform. This is where customers choose to book more than one travel vertical, and that connected trip transactions cohort represented a low double digit share of booking.com's total transactions. That was up 30% year over year. They also saw growth across other verticals, including flight tickets up 44%. Travel is a cyclical space, but booking does have a very solid and well run business, and I think they have the financial fortitude to withstand any near term shakiness in the overall sector.\n\nTravis Hoium: Yeah. It doesn't seem like any of these companies are reporting bad results. It's just a matter of what those expectations are. Now that we're far enough into earning seasons to get a feel for what the economy looks like or at least what we think it's going to look like over the next three months or so, and what the market is looking for. That's maybe even more important.\n\nI want to give you both a chance to put yourselves on a scale, 100% bull, 100% bear. Where are you on the economy and the market?\n\nRachel Warren: I'd say it probably falls somewhere in the middle. I want to say that roughly 80% of S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 earnings so far have exceeded earnings per share estimates. That's outperforming both the five year and the ten year averages of about 78% and 75% respectively. In the near term, you've got the impact of policy shifts like tariffs. You've got macro pressures that could stem from them, that could pose realistic challenges both for the economy and the market and I think it's important to recognize that. Could we see another bear market? Absolutely. As a long term investor, though, I do remain incredibly bullish about prospects for great businesses to generate excellent returns for faithful shareholders and for the market's ability to rise with the passage of time. That's what I'm focusing on.\n\nLou Whiteman: For the market, I'm probably 55, 45 in favor of bullishness. Stocks, generally speaking, yeah, they're on the pricey side, if you look at the indexes, and I think that might limit upside for the second half of the year. But I don't see the elements of a crash building. I think the market can grind at these levels, maybe slowly raise. I don't think it's going to be a dramatic up or a dramatic down. The economy, Travis, that side worries me a bit more. I still think that the tariffs are just beginning to hit Main Street, and they're going to hit it a lot worse in the months to come. I don't think that deflates the markets, though, because I think, A, investors are aware of it and, B, if you look back to Sam Adams last week, I think in some cases, we have now estimated such an effect that the tariffs, if they net out at 15% or whatever, I think we might have actually overstated some of the impact in the quarters to com in our estimates. I do think the market can grind higher from here, even if it gets worse on Main Street, but it does feel like it's just going to be a bit of a trudge from here. It's not going to be a rocket ship market or just crisis on the street market. It's just going to be onward.\n\nTravis Hoium: Lou, you brought up tariffs, and I want to get an idea for as we're ending the Q2 earnings season going into Q3, are you expecting more impact from tariffs, whether that's costs that impact company's margins or consumers just behaving differently? If something is more expensive, maybe you don't reduce the amount of money you're spending overall, but the volume goes down because that average sale price is going up for the items that you're buying. What sort of trends are you looking for there as we go to the second half of the year?\n\nLou Whiteman: Here's my best guess. I do think that on both of those, it's a headwind, both for the companies and just the consumer habits. I think it might be manageable enough that we're talking about maybe estimates are in trouble or estimates have to come down a bit, but it's not going to derail a growth story. I think it's going to just be more than noise. It's going to be a headache, but it's not going to be to the extent that it really drives down the economy or drives down the market.\n\nTravis Hoium: A lot to watch in the second half of the year, and we'll be covering it all on Motley Fool Money.

President Trump is imposing billions of dollars in new import taxes on US firms, yet the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index is up 26% from its April low and fresh off several record highs. Investors who shunned US assets just a few months ago are now aggressively buying.\n\nHowever, numerous warning signs have emerged during the second quarter earnings season as companies outline the ways Trump's tariffs are hurting profits, disrupting operations, and forcing price hikes onto consumers. Tariffs are not hitting every company, since they mainly affect goods, and many of America's top firms are service providers. But some analysts think the negative tariff effects are widespread enough to take the wind out of stocks soon.\n\nWith second quarter earnings in for about two-thirds of S&P 500 companies, Yahoo Finance's Grace O'Donnell has identified more than four dozen large firms saying tariffs are impacting their businesses in some material way. Some are able to quantify the monetary effect on earnings. Others expect tariffs to hit their finances but aren't yet sure how. And some CEOs have been blunt about price hikes heading toward consumers.\n\nManufacturers are bearing a large portion of the tariff cost, since many rely on imported components that are now more expensive. Caterpillar (CAT), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), BMW (BMW.DE), Ford (F), Harley-Davidson (HOG), Hyundai (HYMTF), Tesla (TSLA), GE Aerospace (GE), 3M (MMM), and General Motors (GM) are among the companies saying tariffs reduced earnings in the second quarter. Ford, as one example, said tariffs would knock $2 billion off earnings this year. Caterpillar expects a tariff hit of at least $1.3 billion. Kimberly-Clark's tariff loss will be around $170 million.\n\nRead more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\n\nIt's not just manufacturers.

Tesla conducted its first public test of its self-driving taxis in late June near the company‚Äôs headquarters in Austin, Texas. That test showed the vehicles speeding, braking suddenly, driving over a curb, entering the wrong lane and dropping off passengers in the middle of multilane roads. The National Highway Transit Safety Administration (NHTSA), the main transportation regulator in the US, is investigating the Robotaxi‚Äôs pilot test.\n\nShareholders accused Musk and his electric vehicle maker of repeatedly overstating the effectiveness of and prospects for their autonomous driving technology, inflating Tesla‚Äôs financial prospects and stock price.

The jury found the company 33% responsible for the crash, in which a Tesla Model S accelerated through an intersection and struck the victims while Autopilot was engaged.\n\nMost lawsuits over Tesla's driver-assist technology have been settled quietly; this case went public, and the jury sided with the plaintiffs' argument that Tesla misled consumers by marketing Autopilot as safer than it was while allowing it to operate on roads it wasn't designed for. Tesla countered that the driver, George McGee, was distracted while retrieving his dropped phone and had overridden Autopilot by pressing the accelerator.\n\nThe verdict matters now because it lands as Tesla pushes toward a launch of fully autonomous robotaxis, which are already under scrutiny for safety concerns.

Supply chain hiccups, interest rate pressures, and intense global competition have seen many EV stocks tumbling from their peaks. But for investors with a long-term perspective, August is offering up some pretty compelling opportunities to pick up some popular names at reasonable valuations.\n\nTwo in particular stand out right now: Nio (NIO -8.96%) and Rivian Automotive (RIVN 0.34%). Each faces its own headwinds but also carries a credible growth story and the potential to reward investors who can wait.\n\nNio\n\nNio is China's premium EV daredevil. While most EV makers want to sell you a car, Nio wants to refuel it for you, too. Its battery-swap stations let drivers trade a drained pack for a full one in less time than it takes to grab a latte. In an industry that obsesses over range, that kind of convenience is tough to ignore.\n\nNio's current share price, less than $5, plants its market cap around $10 billion, valuing the company at about 1.06 times sales (for perspective, Tesla's figure is about 11.5). That's pretty cheap for a premium EV brand with real market share in China, the world's largest EV market. Its revenue has grown steadily, reaching about $9.4 billion over the past 12 months.\n\nThe problem is that growth hasn't yet translated into profitability. Nio lost roughly $3.3 billion last year, and gross margins remain stubbornly in the mid single digits. Meanwhile, the Chinese EV market is cutthroat, with rivals Tesla and BYD dominating volume.\n\nThat forces Nio into a tricky balance: trying to protect its brand as a premium choice while staying competitive on cost. So far that has meant operating losses and persistent cash burn, with over $13 billion in total liabilities and just $2 billion in equity.\n\nNio has expanded into Europe, which is exciting, but that comes with its own problem: Wherever Nio goes, it needs to build out its network of battery swapping stations. That intrinsic problem means that expansion into new markets, though potentially beneficial for top-line growth, also comes with operating expenses that will affect its profitability.\n\nStill, last Thursday's 8% rally -- sparked by a blowout launch for its mass-market Onvo L90 SUV -- was a reminder of how quickly sentiment can turn. The first 10,000-unit batch reportedly sold out in just three hours. Management is aiming for adjusted profitability by late 2025 and plans to expand margins and build out its infrastructure moat in battery swaps and autonomous tech. For investors who believe in a future of EVs, today's sub-$5 price could be the low point before a long climb.\n\nRivian\n\nRivian makes electric trucks, SUVs, and delivery vans. Think rugged designs, off-road capability, and outdoorsy brand vibe. On top of that, it has a key partnership with Amazon, which is rolling out Rivian-built electric delivery vans (currently, about 25,000 of these bad boys are on the road). While originally, Amazon had exclusive rights to Rivian, both parties have since amended the contract, allowing Rivian to sell its vans to other companies.\n\nThe near term hasn't been super smooth. In the second quarter, deliveries dropped about 22% year over year to 10,661 vehicles.\n\nWhile that number might seem concerning at first glance, the slowdown may be strategic: Rivian wants to bring its lower-priced R2 SUV to market in 2026, aiming to tap a much larger customer base. The timing also lines up with a fresh $1 billion investment from Volkswagen, which will help develop new EV platforms and software.\n\nFinancially, Rivian is improving but still in the red. It posted a modest gross profit in the first quarter, its second in a row, and revenue edged higher year over year to $1.24 billion.\n\nLosses remain heavy, with negative free cash flow of about $526 million in the quarter. Still, its $4.7 billion cash pile and Volkswagen's funding should give it some breathing room while it works toward profitability.\n\nAt today's share price (about $12 to $13), Rivian's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is about 2.6, far lower than Tesla's. At the same time, if it can nail the R2 launch, keep Amazon vans rolling, and tighten up its cost structure, sentiment could swing fast in the right direction. But there are still a lot of unknowns, and prospective investors should definitely expect a bumpy road before it starts to smooth out.\n\nWhy these EV stocks deserve a look\n\nThe EV market will test your patience, but that's part of the deal. Nio and Rivian each have something real going for them, whether its Nio's surge of demand or Rivian's steady Amazon van pipeline.\n\nBoth are still finding their financial footing, yet their current prices leave plenty of room for increases. If they can deliver on the next leg of growth, today's buyers could be glad they stayed buckled up.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:43:13.014960+00:00"}

The windows, however, unexpectedly shattered, leaving Musk to deliver the rest of his presentation of the new truck while standing in front of the damaged car. Tesla‚Äôs stock fell more than 5% the next day.\n\nWhile the incident seemed like an omen, indicative of the Cybertruck being poised to fail, the botched demonstration actually opened up an opportunity to give the new model a spotlight, von Holzhausen said in an interview with Tesla Club Austria published on Saturday.\n\n‚ÄúIt was just one of those Murphy‚Äôs Law kind of things where something bad happens, but it turned out to be a great meme,‚Äù von Holzhausen said, referring to the phenomenon of when something can go wrong, it usually will. ‚ÄúAnd I think in an odd sort of way‚Äîwe don‚Äôt do marketing‚Äîbut it turned into a great marketing moment.‚Äù\n\nHe added, ‚ÄúIt was not an expected moment, but in that moment, you have to roll with it.‚Äù\n\nFollowing the reveal of the vehicle, Musk posted a video on X of von Holzhausen throwing a steel ball at the model Cybertruck before its launch, with its windows withstanding the force of the throw with no visible damage. The video was viewed more than 6 million times within three days of its posting.\n\n‚ÄúGuess we have some improvements to make before production haha,‚Äù Musk wrote.\n\nDays later, Musk touted the success of the Cybertruck launch, saying Tesla had received more than 200,000 orders for the vehicle. While Tesla does not break out Cybertruck numbers when it reports earnings, instead grouping them with the Model S and X, the company recalled nearly all of the Cybertrucks it had on the road earlier this year due to an issue in which an exterior panel could become detached, and that only tallied around 46,000 vehicles.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:43:16.793396+00:00"}

And Tesla remains the best way for Musk to further consolidate his AI, space, and brain-implant companies into a robot empire.\n\nBut Musk has been working largely for free since 2018, when a Delaware court struck down a $56 billion pay package that shareholders had voted twice to approve. Since then, he has created hundreds of billions of dollars of value for investors, of which Monday‚Äôs grant entitles him to about 4%.

The surge was largely led by strong demand for the Chevrolet Equinox EV model. The US legacy automaker is advancing well in its electrification journey, thanks to its robust portfolio, including 13 models across its Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac brands.\n\nGeneral Motors was the second-largest EV seller in the United States last year, just behind Tesla TSLA and managed to keep up the momentum through the first half of 2025. General Motors‚Äô EV sales in the last reported quarter more than doubled. Meanwhile, GM‚Äôs closest peer, Ford F, witnessed more than a 30% drop in second-quarter EV sales year over year. EV giant Tesla recorded a 13.4% decline in deliveries in the three months ending June.\n\nWhile General Motors' EV sales have been impressive, it will be interesting to watch if the company can sustain its sales growth amid policy shifts and U.S. President Trump‚Äôs unfriendly stance on e-mobility. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the company‚Äôs fundamentals to assess if General Motors is worth buying at the moment.\n\nGM Maintains EPS Beat Streak in Q2 Despite Tariffs\n\nGeneral Motors‚Äô second-quarter 2025 earnings beat was its 12th straight quarterly beat. Strong vehicle demand and stable vehicle pricing led to record first-half 2025 revenues of $91 billion. GMNA (General Motors North America) segment revenues were also a first-half record at roughly $77 billion.\n\nThe company was hit with $1.1 billion in net tariffs in the last reported quarter, although EPS of $2.53 exceeded expectations by 6%. However, GM expects net tariff costs in the third quarter to be higher than in the second quarter. It stuck to its guidance of gross tariff impact of $4-$5 billion for the full year but expects to offset roughly 30% of that through strategic initiatives like cost cuts, stable pricing and production adjustments.

BMW delivered a major blow by canceling a $2.15 billion order amid delays. Scania had to secure alternative supply for its electric fleet as Northvolt struggled to ramp up output.\n\n‚ÄúIf you want to scale up new production capability in a commoditized market, your executions have to be spectacular; Northvolt‚Äôs were not,‚Äù says Douglas. ‚ÄúThey continued to scale up and expand geographically before they had a good handle on their actual production capability. They did not get their yield numbers up, and their delivery times were delayed, so they could not be competitive.‚Äù\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs far from clear whether more financial support would have made a decisive difference, given that Northvolt was already so well financed. According to Craig Douglas, a partner at climate tech venture capital firm World Fund , Northvolt‚Äôs problems had more to do with the difficulty of playing catch-up with China, and the missteps it made along the way.\n\nWhile Canada and Germany both provided significant support and grants to the Swedish company, its home country largely abstained, understandably raising criticism from shareholders and former executives. After all, the dominant Chinese industry has long benefited from state aid, which helped it reach the maturity to drive down unit costs to 30% lower than batteries made in Europe.\n\nHow a company founded by two former Tesla executives managed to fail despite such a massive amount of capital will be a case study for business schools for years to come. It also raises questions as to whether the government did enough to support its former battery champion, and how Europe should revise its approach to competing with China in high-growth, low-carbon industries.\n\nYet one thing is certain: Neither the European Union nor Sweden will rescue Northvolt, even though it was once Europe‚Äôs best funded startup, having secured $15 billion in funding commitments from investors and governments.\n\nThere is still hope that a buyer might emerge to revive the fortunes of the small Swedish factory town dependent on Northvolt‚Äôs success. Silicon Valley startup Lyten has already taken over Northvolt‚Äôs Polish plant , and Swedish truck manufacturer Scania has expressed interest in putting together a consortium to acquire its R&D facility.\n\nJust below the arctic circle, Northvolt‚Äôs flagship battery factory once stood as a beacon of Europe‚Äôs ambitions to power its future with clean energy. But following the company‚Äôs recent bankruptcy , its last production lines have fallen silent .\n\nStory continues\n\nEven Volkswagen, which held a 21% stake in Northvolt, eventually lost faith and took a major write-down on its investment in 2024, moving forward with its own subsidiary, PowerCo‚Äîa move that underscores the ongoing demand for homegrown batteries.\n\nStepping down as CEO after the company applied for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S., Northvolt cofounder Peter Carlsson said that while the company‚Äôs challenges were multifaceted, he had to take responsibility for the fact it had ended up in this situation.\n\nA make-or-break moment for Europe‚Äôs EV sector\n\nNorthvolt‚Äôs failure is undeniably a blow to the wider ecosystem. For Douglas, it ‚Äúwill make a lot of the larger investors nervous about future scale-ups, and stakeholders will be much more focused on the scale-up manufacturing risks than before.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you want to scale up new production capability in a commoditized market, your executions have to be spectacular; Northvolt‚Äôs were not.‚Äù\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs important to remember that Northvolt wasn‚Äôt the only scale-up in the race. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not because some have struggled, like Northvolt, that it‚Äôs the end of the game. Europe needs to keep pushing,‚Äù French entrepreneur Benoit Lemaignan recently said. His startup, Verkor, is backed by Renault, and secured $2.15 billion to build an EV battery gigafactory in Dunkirk, France.\n\nOnce presented as the French Northvolt, Verkor has moved more slowly than its former peer. Although its pilot line located in Grenoble is manufacturing cells‚Äîthe basic units that store energy in a battery‚Äîfull-scale production in Dunkirk hasn‚Äôt started yet.\n\nThis means that Verkor is still in a critical transition phase, but it can at least now count on a little help from Brussels.\n\nThe European Commission recently announced it will distribute approximately $1 billion in grants to six EV battery projects, as it seeks to level the playing field and support Europe‚Äôs transition to a clean, competitive, and resilient industrial base. These include Verkor, but also NOVO Energy, a former joint venture between Northvolt and Volvo Cars, the latter of which recently took full ownership; Cellforce, owned by Porsche; and ACC, backed by Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not because some have struggled, like Northvolt, that it‚Äôs the end of the game. Europe needs to keep pushing.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThere are enough examples in history that show that it is seldom too late to catch up, but the question is whether we are willing to do what it takes to compete,‚Äù says Andreas Fischer, a founding partner at deep tech VC firm First Momentum Ventures. In his view, this would require investing heavily in the entire European EV industry, not trying to pick a ‚Äúwinning‚Äù company.\n\nProtectionism, specialization, and long-termism\n\nIt‚Äôs a view shared by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which says that we‚Äôre in a ‚Äúmake or break‚Äù moment for the European battery industry. Although China‚Äîwhich has extensive manufacturing know-how and supply-chain integration‚Äînow produces three-quarters of batteries globally, there are pathways for building a more competitive battery industry in Europe, beyond blanket subsidization.\n\n‚ÄúAll start with ensuring strong domestic demand, which gives manufacturers time to hone production processes and develop strong regional industrial ecosystems. On this front, clear policy that signals continued demand growth and reduces investment risks is essential,‚Äù the IEA wrote earlier this year.\n\nFischer adds that policy support for the European battery industry would also need to involve either loosening regulations or turning to protectionist policies, such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, an EU system to confirm that a price has been paid for the carbon emitted during the production of certain imported goods, which will fully apply from 2026.\n\nDouglas agrees‚Äî‚Äúthings like the CBAM or local content requirements could help create a level playing field with a clearer value add for being local‚Äù‚Äîbut still thinks it is going to be difficult for Europe to compete in the two main types of lithium-ion batteries currently used in electric vehicles: LFP (lithium iron phosphate), prices for which have dropped, especially in China; and NMC (nickel manganese cobalt oxide), in which Korea and Japan have developed strong expertise.\n\nInstead, Douglas believes that Europe stands a better chance at high-end cells and new cell chemistry. He also points to other related industries where the price gap with China is either less, or just less important: ‚ÄúDecarbonized industrial manufacturing, recycling and circularity, biotech and agritech, and energy business model innovations all have great starts in Europe.‚Äù\n\nNonetheless, Northvolt‚Äôs collapse exposed scale-up shortcomings that need to be addressed if Europe wants to build the supply chains that are crucial for its sovereignty, in EV batteries and beyond.\n\nOne of these, according to Herbert Mangesius, a general partner at early-stage deep tech VC firm Vsquared, is that Western VC ecosystems should better appreciate how hard it is to build economically viable production systems at the scale and sophistication of China‚Äôs. ‚ÄúIt is crucial to have appropriate risk management and oversight engraved in governance structures, i.e., the ability to judge progress relative to budgets,‚Äù he cautions.\n\nAt a system level, cheap energy and a skilled workforce are also a necessary ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù for competitiveness, Mangesius adds. Achieving those can take time, but that itself is a lesson in how the Chinese built their own thriving industries. Says Mangesius: ‚ÄúChina shows consistency in industry policies, which allows reliable and competitive ecosystems to build up, in particular in clean-tech sectors.‚Äù\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:43:22.085338+00:00"}

Unfortunately, Musk has given no indication that he is even remotely interested in taking SpaceX public.\n\nHowever, there's another possibility that could be interesting.

He said that the business needed to achieve predictability and to be \"in a smooth sailing situation\" before an IPO, and with most reports indicating that Starlink is nicely profitable and generating billions in recurring revenue, there's an argument to be made that Musk's benchmarks have been met.\n\nOn the other hand, in a 2023 post on X, Musk told investors that Starlink wasn't having any problems raising money through private investors, and therefore it didn't make sense to go through the trouble of taking Starlink public.\n\nMore recently, Musk said at a 2025 conference that it's \"possible that Starlink may go public at some point in the future,\" but he didn't seem to be in any rush to make it happen.\n\nHow much could Starlink be worth as a public company?\n\nSpaceX, the parent of Starlink, is reportedly valued at about $400 billion in the private markets, based on a $1 billion share sale in July.\n\nWhen it comes to the standalone value of Starlink, which makes up the bulk of SpaceX's revenue according to most estimates, it's a little more difficult. Plus, the potential valuation depends on whom you ask. One analyst estimates that Starlink will reach $12.3 billion in revenue in 2025.\n\nAs far as how this might translate into a market value, estimates have varied widely. Most estimates have been in the $30 billion to $100 billion range, although billionaire investor Ron Baron said that Starlink will go public at a valuation in the $250 billion to $300 billion range, but that it won't happen until about 2027.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhile a Starlink (or SpaceX) IPO isn't out of the question, I don't view it as likely to happen in 2025. For one thing, Starlink has become a cash machine for SpaceX and is instrumental in funding its development. And as we've seen with virtually every private funding round and stock sale, SpaceX has absolutely no difficulty in raising money through private investors. As mentioned, Musk indicated this in a 2023 post, and I'd argue that it's even easier for Starlink to raise money now.\n\nIf Starlink does go public, I'd say there's a higher probability of a traditional IPO than a SPAC. It would likely be the largest SPAC target of all time if it chooses that route, and while both processes have their pros and cons, the poor record of SPAC IPO performance might scare Musk away from this route.\n\nTo sum it up, I'm not holding my breath for a Starlink IPO in 2025, even though Musk has said that he'd eventually like to do one. It may come later, but I just don't see Musk in any particular rush to take the company public.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T14:36:43.534761+00:00"}
