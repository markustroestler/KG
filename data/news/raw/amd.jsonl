But Trump is essentially extorting certain companies to get things he wants from them. Clever CEOs are playing along, whether shareholders like it or not.\n\nExhibit A consists of Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which are basically buying export licenses from the Trump administration so they can sell semiconductors in China. Both companies have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from chip sales in China in exchange for the right to sell there.\n\n“My political head is spinning again with this new pay-to-play plan with Nvidia and AMD,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in an Aug. 11 analysis. “I pray for the sake of American free market capitalism that it stops here.\"\n\nThe Nvidia and AMD deals immediately bring to mind competitor Intel (INTC), which hasn’t yet agreed to cough up an export toll. Here’s a safe guess: It, too, will pay a similar fee for similar privileges.\n\nAt the moment, Intel is doing damage control. On Aug. 7, Trump directly attacked CEO Lip-Bu Tan, saying on social media that he “must resign, immediately.” Trump and some other Republicans seem to be concerned that Tan had improper connections with China’s military at another firm he ran until 2021.\n\nTan, a US citizen, met with Trump on August 12, to demonstrate his commitment to American interests, according to the Wall Street Journal. Something changed, because Trump called the meeting a \"success.\" That may indicate that money is forthcoming. Watch for Intel to pony up, just as Nvidia and AMD did.\n\nNvidia’s 15% gratuity to the government for chip sales to China will cost the firm about $3 billion per year. The company’s stock dipped on the news, then drifted up. Investors may have first thought only of the bottom line, then decided the payment would be better than losing chip sales to China completely. The hit to AMD would be smaller because its China sales are lower. AMD stock also dipped then rose following the news. Intel stock rose on news of Tan’s chat with Trump, as buyers hope the company’s damage-control effort pays off.\n\nTrump has engineered this whole scenario. In April, Trump tightened restrictions on US chip sales to China, essentially blocking the sale of certain chips. Nvidia said that move would cost the company $5.5 billion in lost revenue. Then, in July, Trump reversed himself and decided to allow such chip sales to China.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:15:14.148730+00:00"}

Shares rose 3.5% on Monday during the day as reports circulated about the meeting.\n\nCiting unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Tan was set to meet with Trump on Monday to explain his personal and professional background and to propose ways that Intel and the government can collaborate.\n\nLast week, Trump called for Tan's resignation in a Truth Social post minutes after Fox Business covered Republican Sen. Tom Cotton's recent criticism of the CEO over his ties with China. In a letter to Intel, Cotton expressed \"concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations,\" given Tan’s investments in Chinese businesses through his venture capital firm, Walden International.\n\nTrump wrote in his post last Thursday, \"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately.”\n\nTan responded by saying reports about his career contained \"misinformation.\"\n\n\"There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles ...

President Donald Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook last week, with Apple announcing a $600 billion investment in U.S. operations, while Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give 15% of revenue from Chinese goods to the U.S. government in exchange for the ability to sell chips to China.\n\nBut coffee chain Dutch Bros' (BROS 2.00%) stock soared last week on its own news, and after middling performance for most of the year, it's up more than 26%, beating the S&P 500's 9% rise.\n\nHere's why the market is loving Dutch Bros.\n\nBack to the basics\n\nInvestors love to get into a detailed earnings report or 10-K filing to see how a company's finances are doing. But the beginning of any great company is a great product. Dutch Bros sells coffee through its chain of just over 1,000 stores today, but its concept was built on innovative products, and that vibrant approach to coffee still drives the business.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the economics here are excellent, which furthers the investment thesis. But it starts with great coffee that customers love, and the high sales follow.\n\nCEO Christine Barone detailed the company's three-part plan to generate higher transaction growth. It involves menu innovation, paid advertising to enhance brand awareness as it rolls out in new regions, and leaning into the loyalty program.\n\nDutch Bros has always differentiated itself by launching its own branded beverages, and that's one way it stands out. Barone called it a mix of art and science, understanding what's trending in the coffee world and translating it into products that its customers want to drink. Some of the innovation is in the customized beverages, such as protein coffee and flavors like lavender, and some of that is in the menu itself. One of the initiatives it's working on is a pilot of a morning food menu, which is driving higher engagement and sales in the morning coffee run.\n\nPart of the product is the experience, and making its stores a positive experience involves rigorous systems and technology to ensure speed and effective customer service. The company takes things slow in that respect to ensure it has its systems in check before opening new stores or making any changes. Barone said that the food menu will roll out slowly through 2026 even though it's already demonstrating positive metrics, to ensure that stores are ready to handle it.\n\nPhenomenal performance\n\nThis fresh approach is driving incredible growth. Revenue increased 28% year over year in the 2025 second quarter, with a 6.1% increase in same-shop sales and a 3.7% increase in transactions.\n\nCompany-operated shop contribution margin was 31.1%, 0.3 percentage points higher than last year, and net income increased from $22.2 million to $38.4 million. Management raised full-year guidance after the report.\n\nMassive expansion\n\nDutch Bros recently hit the 1,000-store mark, up from less than 500 when it went public in 2021. It's planning to double its store count again, hitting 2,029 stores by 2029.\n\nThe company is deliberate in its store opening strategy, but it's going to need to accelerate to reach that target. It opened 31 stores in the second quarter, and plans for at least 160 this year, which means things are going to speed up in the second half of the year. It's going to need to open even faster over the next four years to hit that target, but as it refines and perfects its strategy, it should be easier.\n\nLonger term, it sees the opportunity for 7,000 stores, or seven times its current store count. It has already raised that from its original target of 4,000 stores, and that ceiling could be raised again as it builds its brand and generates consumer loyalty.\n\nDutch Bros is brimming with opportunity, and it's not surprising that investors are scooping it up.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:15:19.129001+00:00"}

In a controversial move, the U.S. will take a 15% cut of those sales.\n\nHowever, Chinese authorities have sent notices to a range of firms discouraging the use of Nvidia H20 processors, Bloomberg reported. It took a particularly strong stance against the use of Nvidia chips for any government or national security-related work by state enterprises or private companies.\n\nChinese state media has alleged that Nvidia's H20 chips might contain \"backdoors\" that would allow remote access and control and potentially contain a \"kill switch.\" Nvidia has vehemently denied those claims.\n\nMeanwhile, the Information reported Tuesday that Chinese regulators have ordered large tech companies to suspend purchases of Nvidia's H20 processors.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China ordered TikTok owner ByteDance, Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) to suspend orders of H20 chips, the report said.

The deadline extension means that the US will continue to charge a 30% tariff on Chinese imports, while China will continue to charge a 10% levy on US imports.\n\nFinally, stablecoins and stablecoin growth have been all the rage in the cryptocurrency arena.

And despite repeated calls from Trump to lower interest rates, the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady for the fifth meeting in a row at the end of July.\n\nMeanwhile, the second-quarter earnings season got into swing in July, with Wall Street banks and major companies globally reporting results. In late July, the \" Magnificent 7\" drew much of the market attention , with six of this group of tech giants having reported by the end of the month. While the companies delivered earnings beats, market reaction to the results was mixed, as investor expectations remain high around their performance.\n\nTariff deals were announced with the likes of Vietnam, Japan and the European Union over the course of the month.

This is a 12% drop compared with the $25.05bn reported a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.40 compared with expectations of $0.42, while operating income of $923m was also lower than the expected $1.23bn.\n\nRead more: Over 3.6 million UK investors to pay dividend tax\n\n\"We continue to expand our vehicle offering, including first builds of a more affordable model in June, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025,\" the company said in a statement.

However, it was reported on Monday that Nvidia (NVDA) and fellow chipmaker AMD (AMD) had agreed to give the US government 15% of their revenues from chip sales in China.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThis deal is likely to be in focus for investors going into Nvidia's (NVDA) second-quarter earnings, which are due to be released on 27 August.\n\nCommenting on the news of the chipmakers' deal with the US government, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Nvidia’s (NVDA) Q1 revenue took at $2.5bn hit due to restrictions on H20 sales to China, but it clearly believes the 15% contribution is well worth it, to keep access to the vast and fast developing market. The unusual arrangement is another example of a mega tech company acquiescing to the US administration’s demands, to gain an upper hand as trade relations are redrawn.\"\n\nFor the second quarter, Nvidia (NVDA) had previously guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2%.\n\nMetals One (MET1.L)\n\nLondon-listed minerals exploration company Metals One (MET1.L) emerged as the most-bought stock on Interactive Investor's July list, with shares up nearly 63% year-to-date.\n\nInteractive Investor's Hunt said: \"Somewhere towards the top of the risk spectrum are small exploration companies and one in particular has caught the eye of the most determined II customers\"\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nThe company currently has a market cap of £34.63m and a share price of 7.08p, at the time of writing.\n\n\"Unknown in February when the shares traded at 2.4p, feverish speculation in May around a potential acquisition in Norway which would give the company access to gold, copper and nickel deposits, was followed by unsubstantiated claims from outside the company of a massive uranium find,\" said Hunter.\n\nDefence has remained a popular theme with investors, with FTSE 100-listed (^FTSE) Rolls-Royce (RR.L) appearing once more on Interactive Investor's most bought list.\n\nShares are up 91% year-to-date, lifting the company to a market cap of $90.8bn, though Hunter said this \"has not been enough to deter followers of the stock because of valuation concerns\".\n\nThe stock is now up 1069% on a five-year basis, with the most recent jump coming on the back of the company's half-year results, released in late July.\n\nRead more: Defence companies post strong results as UK investors back the sector over AI\n\nThe aero-engineer reported an underlying operating profit of £1.76bn in the first half of the year, versus £1.15bn a year ago. Underlying revenue of £9.06bn was also up on the £8.18bn Rolls-Royce (RR.L) reported in the first half of last year.\n\nHunter said that Rolls-Royce (RR.L) reported \"strong progress across each of its divisions. With flying hours on the increase and with no signs of defence spending wavering, the story may yet have further to run\".\n\nPalantir (PLTR)\n\nCombining both the themes of defence and AI is data software company Palantir (PLTR), which was among the top-traded stocks on the Robinhood UK platform in July.\n\nRobinhood UK's Lane said that Palantir (PLTR) \"rallied to new all-time highs in July, with a $100m government contract making the headlines, along with news of a new product in the works, designed to plan, build and review applications on the Palantir platform\".\n\nShares are up 141% year-to-date, with the stock having risen on the back of its second-quarter earnings, released in early August.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) posted earnings per share of $0.16 for the quarter, beating consensus estimates of $0.14 and up 77% from the same period last year. Revenue came in at $1.004bn, Palantir's first quarter surpassing the billion-dollar mark on a quarterly basis. The company's top line also beat analyst forecasts for $939.25bn and was up 48% year-over-year.\n\nMost popular funds in July\n\nAs buoyant sentiment drove markets higher last month, investors continued to put money into US and global passive funds in June, giving them exposure to some of the world's biggest companies, such as the \"Magnificent 7\" tech behemoths.\n\nSam Benstead, fixed income lead at Interactive Investor, said: \"Looking at passives, low-cost, global funds were popular in July’s top 10, including Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index and HSBC FTSE All-World Index. It’s always sensible to take a quick look at the country allocation in the fund factsheet before investing, so that you can get the right fit for your portfolio. For example, some global funds invest in developing markets and some don’t.\"\n\nThe active fund that appeared in both Interactive Investor and Hargreaves Lansdown's top 10 lists was Artemis Global Income (0P0000W36K.L).\n\nAccording to a fund update, published at the end of last month, the fund rose 11.7% in the second quarter, compared with gains of 5.0% from its MSCI AC World benchmark and 2.8% from its IA Global Equity Income sector average.\n\nThe biggest contributor to outperformance was the fund's some 20% exposure to aerospace and defence, which includes holdings in Germany's Rheinmetall (RHM.DE) and BAE Systems (BA.L).\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:15:46.014889+00:00"}

In July, Trump relaxed some restrictions imposed by Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nThe deal with Nvidia and AMD seems as much about personally appealing to Trump as it does about generating revenue for the US government. The agreement has all the trappings of Trump entering into business with the chipmakers.\n\nIn a way, it’s a version of a playbook other major tech companies have been trying out as Trump is dramatically changing the international business landscape. Apple announced a $100bn investment commitment in US manufacturing. CEO Tim Cook, who had made the journey to the White House himself, presented Trump with a glass trophy (including 24 karat gold base) designating the president a graduate of the Apple Manufacturing Academy, launched in Michigan the week prior.\n\nDuring his meeting with Cook, Trump said he would levy a 100% tariff on semiconductor chips, which could set both Apple and Nvidia back billions. However, the president said: “If you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.”\n\nBoth Nvidia and Apple are likely to be exempted from the tariffs. Each appears to have paid for the privilege – Apple with its domestic investment, Nvidia with its revenue-sharing agreement.\n\nOpenAI debuts GPT-5\n\nOpenAI launched the new version of the artificial intelligence that underpins ChatGPT last week. There are quite a few aspects of the release to consider to understand it fully – what the company is saying, where the AI race between tech giants stands, the model’s new capabilities and pitfalls, the environmental impact – so I’ve rounded up the Guardian’s coverage of GPT-5 below.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:15:47.817937+00:00"}

Plenty of other companies are using AI to great effect, but they don't get the same level of attention.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM -0.80%) is killing it in AI, and it's a real shame many investors haven't caught on. IBM's AI strategy is focused on providing solutions to its enterprise clients. The company isn't plowing mountains of capital into AI data centers, and it isn't splurging on training industry-leading models. Instead, through a mix of consulting services, software, and hardware, IBM is emerging as a leader in enterprise AI.\n\n$7.5 billion and counting\n\nSince IBM kicked off its generative AI strategy, the company has booked more than $7.5 billion worth of business. Around 80% of this total comes from the consulting business, with the rest coming from software. Playing a supporting role is hardware, namely IBM's decades-old mainframe business.\n\nIBM's consulting-forward strategy works because enterprise clients need more than software. IBM's watsonx platform provides the software tools necessary for clients to develop, fine-tune, deploy, and govern AI agents and applications, but implementation services and other offerings from the consulting business are equally important. A client who uses AWS and Azure for cloud computing may want to deploy watsonx on those platforms, for example, requiring a complex solution that IBM can provide.\n\nIBM does train its own AI models, but the focus is on speed, safety, and cost. IBM's Granite family of models are designed to be fine-tunable for specific tasks. They're open source, perform well in safety benchmarks, and are cost-effective for businesses. In terms of performance, Granite beats competing AI models of similar complexity in a variety of benchmarks.\n\nIBM's mainframe business shouldn't be ignored. Major industries including financial services still depend heavily on IBM's mainframe systems, and the latest z17 model brings some serious AI firepower. The z17 is designed for more than 250 distinct AI use cases, ranging from loan risk mitigation to medical image analysis, and it can handle 450 billion AI inferencing operations per day with response times of one millisecond. For enterprises needing real-time AI inferencing and rock-solid reliability, IBM's mainframes continue to be the best option.\n\nImportantly, IBM's AI strategy doesn't depend on AI technology making exponential gains in capabilities, or on ever-increasing AI infrastructure investments. Because IBM is focusing on delivering AI solutions that help companies reduce costs or boost efficiency, demand should hold up even if the AI frenzy cools off. As it stands today, AI is incredibly useful for businesses, and IBM is playing a critical role in enabling enterprises to tap into the technology.\n\nSurging free cash flow\n\nAfter a decade of uninspiring results and inconsistent revenue growth, IBM has settled into a groove. The company has shed slow-growing businesses and bet on its hybrid cloud computing and AI platforms. Revenue is not only growing again but accelerating, and profits are improving.\n\nFor 2025, IBM expects revenue at constant currency to grow by at least 5%. That may not seem all that quick, but IBM is still a sprawling company with numerous product and service offerings, and it's currently facing a slowdown in demand for discretionary tech projects. Some parts of IBM are growing slowly, and some, like AI, are growing much faster.\n\nIBM also expects to generate more than $13.5 billion in free cash flow this year, up from $12.7 billion in 2024. That's solid growth, particularly given the unpredictable economic developments so far in 2025. Strong growth for IBM's high-margin software business, its largest segment, is helping the cause. Software revenue grew by 8% in the second quarter and managed a segment operating profit margin of 31.1%.\n\nWith solid profits, a return to reliable revenue growth, and an AI strategy that's working well with its enterprise client base, IBM is an AI stock that all investors should seriously consider.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:15:54.010149+00:00"}

Notably, 19 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory and 11 finished in positive territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 21,385.40, declining 0.3%, due to the weak performance from semiconductor giants.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.3% to finish at 6,373.45.

On the other hand, the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) rose 0.5%.\n\nThe fear gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 7.3% to 16.25. A total of 15.5 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 18.3 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.18-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.\n\nInflation Data in Focus\n\nThis week, the major focus will be on two key inflation data. The consumer price index (CPI), which is commonly known as household inflation and the producer price index (PPI) will be released on Tuesday and Thursday morning, respectively. Soft reading of these two key inflation data is likely to boost investors’ sentiment for the first interest rate cut by the Fed in September.\n\n\n\nExpectations of a rate cut have gathered steam following unexpectedly weak jobs additions in July as well as significantly downwardly revised jobs data for both June and May. The Fed will conduct its important Jackson Hole Symposium for Economic Policies during Aug. 21-23. The release of CPI and PPI data ahead of the symposium will be important to set the tone for the September FOMC meeting.\n\n\n\nThe CME FedWatch currently shows an 84.5% probability that the central bank will reduce the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in September. This probability was 80.3% last week. The existing Fed fund rate is in the range of 4.25- 4.5%.\n\nRevenue-for-Export Deal\n\nPresident Donald Trump confirmed that the U.S. government has reached a deal with semiconductor giants NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, in which these two companies will pay 15% of their revenues from some chip sales to China. In return, these companies will get licenses for AI-powered chip sales in China.\n\n\n\nEarlier, President Trump banned NVDA’s AI-powered H20 accelerator and AMD’s MI308 AI chips for being exported to China. Several analysts have raised concern that this measure will significantly impact the margins of these companies. Moreover, the new strategy may set a dangerous precedent through which the Government will tax critical U.S. exports, potentially extending beyond semiconductors.\n\n\n\nThe stock prices of NVDA and AMD fell by 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.

I called some CEOs yesterday to get their thoughts on Nvidia and AMD’s deal to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of AI chip sales to China to secure export licenses. Most were surprisingly sanguine about the unusual arrangement.\n\nCorey duBrowa, who is global CEO of communications giant Burson, described the deal as “another novel approach that’s being implemented by the Trump administration as they continue to rewrite trade norms and practices.”\n\nA veteran leader in the manufacturing space described the deal as proof of Trump’s commitment to American manufacturing, adding that the cost was likely worth it. Another U.S.-based CEO called it “brilliant, a tariff that we don’t have to pay.”\n\nBut some also raised questions:\n\nWhat does this mean for national security? Such restrictions are designed to address national security concerns, not raise revenue. Governments typically only make money when penalizing those who break the rules. Could financial incentives put security priorities on hold? Allies are historically able to buy military equipment and sensitive technologies that others are not. Could this further erode trust?\n\nHow will this impact trade deals? Many CEOs believe tariffs are here to stay, as America’s trading partners create their own walled fortresses and blocs.\n\nWhere will the money go? Export fees and tariffs mean higher costs for U.S. consumers and companies, and higher revenue for the government. Tariffs alone are expected to bring in $50 billion a month. The Nvidia/AMD deals could add another $4 billion to Treasury coffers next year. Will that be used to pay down debt, help consumers, or be spent some other way?\n\n\n\nContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:16:01.012405+00:00"}

Once in a while, something of importance can fall through the cracks.\n\nFor example, the sheer abundance of Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission might go unnoticed by investors. A 13F is a required filing no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management. It provides a snapshot for investors of which stocks Wall Street's smartest fund managers are buying and selling.\n\nWhile there's no substitute to quarterly earnings reports, knowing which stocks and trends Wall Street's leading asset managers are buying into or selling out of is equally valuable.\n\nBeyond Warren Buffett, Appaloosa's billionaire chief David Tepper tends to be one of the most-followed fund managers. Tepper's willingness to dive into popular growth stocks has resonated with investors during the current bull market.\n\nHowever, Tepper's trading activity over the previous year (April 1, 2024–March 31, 2025) has been eyebrow-raising, to say the least. Based on 13Fs, he's been a persistent seller of two of Wall Street's most-popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%). At the same time, he's chosen to buy shares of a cutting-edge company whose total addressable market is estimated at $205 billion.\n\nTepper shows AI hardware stocks to the door\n\nOver a 12-month period ended March 31, Tepper and his team completely exited 14 holdings and reduced Appaloosa's stake in 19 other positions. Among these moves, the two most noteworthy are:\n\nNvidia : 4,120,000 shares sold, representing a 93% reduction (note: this accounts for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024).\n\n: 4,120,000 shares sold, representing a 93% reduction (note: this accounts for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024). Advanced Micro Devices: 1,630,000 shares sold, representing a complete exit from this position.\n\nOn paper, everything would seem to be going great for these developers of graphics processing unit (GPUs). Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell GPUs hold a majority of AI-accelerated data center market share, while AMD's Instinct series chips are ramping up and aiming to siphon away market share from Nvidia. For more than two years, businesses have been spending aggressively on AI-data center infrastructure to gain first-mover advantages over their peers.\n\nNvidia has been particularly adept at growing its sales and keeping customers loyal thanks to its CUDA software platform. CUDA is what developers use to maximize the computing potential of their Nvidia GPUs, as well as to train large language models.\n\nHowever, David Tepper's selling activity in AI hardware stocks was likely undertaken with a purpose.\n\nOne possibility is that Tepper and his team were (pardon the pun) taking their chips off the table after a sizable run-up in the shares of both Nvidia and AMD. The average holding period for Appaloosa's securities is two years and five months, which suggests Tepper isn't shy about locking in gains when presented with the opportunity to do so. The concern is there may be more to this story than just profit-taking.\n\nArguably the biggest worry with the AI revolution is that it'll follow historical precedent. For more than three decades, every game-changing technology has worked its way through an early stage bubble that eventually burst. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology would earn wide adoption and become useful. It takes time for next-big-thing innovations to mature, and artificial intelligence doesn't look as if it'll be the exception.\n\nIf an AI bubble were to form and burst, AI hardware stocks like Nvidia and AMD would undoubtedly feel the pinch.\n\nCompetitive pressures are also a concern (more so for Nvidia than AMD). Though most eyes tend to be on external competitors developing AI-GPUs, internal competition is possibly an even bigger story.\n\nMany of Wall Street's most-influential companies are internally developing AI chips to use in their data centers. Even though this hardware can't compete with Nvidia and/or AMD on a compute basis, it'll be considerably cheaper and more readily available. In other words, it's a recipe for less AI-GPU scarcity, weaker pricing power, and lower gross margin for Nvidia and AMD.\n\nThis fintech goliath has Tepper's undivided attention\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Tepper added 10 new stocks to Appaloosa's nearly $8.4 billion investment portfolio over the last year (excluding options). Arguably one of the more attractive additions is that of fintech juggernaut Block (XYZ 2.00%).\n\nDuring the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tepper's fund held in excess of 400,000 shares of Block. But by the end of the first quarter of 2021, every share had been sent to the chopping block. Following a four-year hiatus, Block stock is back in Appaloosa's investment portfolio, with Tepper adding 75,000 shares during the March-ended quarter.\n\nBlock has two distinct operating segments -- Square ecosystem and Cash App -- each of which brings a sizable addressable market to the table.\n\nThe Square ecosystem is Block's foundational operating division, with this segment sporting an estimated addressable market of $130 billion, based on a research note released in November 2024 by Piper Sandler analyst Arvind Ramnani.\n\nSquare is the merchant-focused portion of Block's business that's designed to facilitate digital/mobile payments, as well as provide merchants with payment solutions and data analytics. During the fourth quarter of 2020, gross payment volume (GPV) totaled $29.4 billion for the Square ecosystem. But as of the second quarter of 2025, GPV topped $64.2 billion.\n\nThe rapid expansion in GPV on Square's payment networks is a function of sustained double-digit growth in international markets, as well as a higher percentage of GPV originating from larger businesses (those with $500,000 or more in annual GPV).\n\nThe other key puzzle piece for Block is its mobile payment service known as Cash App. Ramnani views Cash App as being a $75 billion addressable opportunity for Block. When combined with the Square ecosystem, Block is staring down an estimated $205 billion tailwind.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Cash App had 36 million monthly active customers. But as of the midpoint of 2025, there are now 57 million monthly transacting active users. Cash App is a higher margin opportunity for Block than the Square ecosystem, with gross profit per Cash App user often heavily outpacing the cost to acquire Cash App actives.\n\nThough both of Block's operating segments are more than a decade old, they're arguably still early in their respective expansions. Even with competition picking up in the digital payments arena, Block appears well-positioned to capitalize on a sustained double-digit growth opportunity.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:16:02.952584+00:00"}

Trump said he would consider a deal that would allow Nvidia to ship its Blackwell chips to China if the company could design it to be less advanced.\n\nTrump’s transactional policy approach saw him approve the sale of United States Steel Corp. to Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp. in a $14.1 billion deal that included caveats such as agreeing to US national security rules and a “golden share” for the US government. Japan, South Korea and the European Union all pledged to invest billions in the US, helping secure tariff rates of 15%, while companies such as Apple Inc. have also skirted levies by promising to invest hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nThe chip-payment arrangement may face legal challenges because it could be construed as an export tax, something that’s not allowed under the constitution, trade experts said. The proposal is the latest direct government intervention into business and finance since Trump returned to the Oval Office in January. As well as a chaotic tariff campaign and persistent criticism of a sitting Federal Reserve chairman, Trump has used his Truth Social platform for everything from calling on CEOs to resign to offering commentary on corporate advertising campaigns.\n\n“To call this unusual or unprecedented would be a staggering understatement,” said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator now with the Singapore-based ISEA — Yusof Ishak Institute. “What we are seeing is in effect the monetization of US trade policy in which US companies must pay the US government for permission to export. If that’s the case, we’ve entered into a new and dangerous world.”\n\nNvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. agreed to pay the US government 15% of revenue from some chip sales to China. The chips — Nvidia’s H20 AI accelerator and AMD’s MI308 chips — were earlier banned by the Trump administration and require export licenses to sell.\n\nThe revenue-for-exports deal between the US government and two of the world’s biggest chipmakers opens a new front in a trading regime turned upside down by Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continues\n\n“It’s possible I’d make a deal” on a “somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell” processor, he said in a briefing with reporters. “In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.”\n\nThe Nvidia and AMD revenue-sharing deals may now prompt the White House to target other industries and goods, according to Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore.\n\n“The sky is the limit,” she said. “You could come up with all sorts of company-specific, country-specific combinations that would say, ‘No one else can trade, but if you pay us directly, then you get the ability to trade.’”\n\nAlthough Nvidia and AMD agreed to the terms, there are questions about the legality of the agreement, Elms said. The arrangement looks like an export tax, which is forbidden by the US Constitution.\n\nThe Trump administration is already in the midst of a lawsuit related to his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy what he called “reciprocal” tariffs on the world. On Friday, Trump warned of a “GREAT DEPRESSION” if US courts ruled that his tariffs were illegal.\n\nChips are at the heart of the US-China battle to dominate industries of the future such as AI and automation. The Biden administration restricted the sale of advanced chips to China, prompting Nvidia to develop the H20 to comply with those restrictions. Trump administration officials tightened export controls in April by barring Nvidia from selling the chips without a permit.\n\nLast month, however, the White House decided to allow Nvidia and AMD to resume sales of chips designed specifically for the Chinese market, which are several rungs below the most advanced artificial intelligence accelerators. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the administration wanted Chinese developers “addicted” to American technology.\n\nChina has grown increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese firms deploying the H20, particularly after the US called for the chips to be installed with tracking technology to better enforce export controls. Yuyuantantian, a social media account affiliated with state-run China Central Television that regularly signals Beijing’s thinking about trade, on Sunday slammed the chip’s supposed security vulnerabilities and inefficiency.\n\nStill, Chinese companies could use the H20s because domestic firms can’t produce enough AI chips to meet demand. That potentially provides an opportunity for Nvidia and AMD to sell more — and now for the US government to earn additional revenue as well.\n\nTrump extended a pause of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days into early November, stabilizing trade ties between the world’s two largest economies.\n\n“There’s clearly a shift by the administration to take a lighter national security stance as these negotiations are ongoing,” said Drew DeLong, lead in geopolitical dynamics practice at Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm.\n\nChina Draws Red Lines on US Chip Tracking With Nvidia Meeting\n\nWhile the US has intervened before, including by taking stakes in private companies after the 2008 financial crisis, a similar deal like the one struck with Nvidia and AMD is hard to remember and — without proper oversight — could lead to a “crony capitalism state,” according to Scott Kennedy, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n“It represents a huge shift in the way the American economy is supposed to operate,” Kennedy said. “It won’t make anyone happy except maybe the Chinese, who will get their chips and watch the US political system go through gyration and domestic tensions.”\n\n(Updates to include reference to Blackwell chip sales in sixth and seventh paragraphs, extention of trade truce in 16th.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:16:07.417111+00:00"}

Nvidia immediately halted its sales and took a charge of $4.5 billion on its Q1 results for H20 inventory and purchase commitments.\n\nThen in mid-July, Nvidia emailed investors who subscribe to the company's news and said it was \"filing applications to sell the Nvidia H20 GPU again. The U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon.\"\n\nAt the time, there was no mention of giving the government a 15% cut of H20 revenue as a condition for obtaining export licenses.\n\nHow will Nvidia's revenue be affected by this deal?\n\nWe can get an estimate as to how this deal will affect Nvidia's financial results by looking at the company's fiscal first quarter, which ended on April 27.\n\nIn that quarter, Nvidia sold $4.6 billion in H20 chips to China prior to the start of the export controls in mid-April. It said it was unable to ship $2.5 billion in H20 chips that it had already produced due to the export controls. So, had the restrictions not existed, Nvidia would have sold $7.1 billion in H20 chips to China customers in Q1. This amounts to 15.2% of $46.6 billion, which is what its total revenue would have been, absent the export controls.\n\nOver 15% of its total revenue is significant, so you can see the importance of Nvidia's China data center business.\n\nFor its fiscal Q2 (which ended July 27), investors should expect Nvidia to report no sales of its H20 chip, because the export restrictions were in place the entire quarter. However, H20 sales should fully rebound in fiscal Q3 (late July to late October).\n\nWhen Nvidia provided Q2 guidance, it estimated that it would lose about $8 billion in H20 chip sales due to the export controls. So, keeping with roughly the same sequential quarter growth, let's assume Q3 H20 sales will be about $9 billion. In this case, Nvidia would pay the U.S. government $1.35 billion, which is 15% of $9 billion.\n\nWhile $1.35 billion seems like a huge number, it's only a small percentage of Nvidia's overall quarterly revenue. In Q1, Nvidia's total revenue was $44.1 billion -- and it would have been $46.6 billion, had it not \"lost\" sales of $2.5 billion due to the export restrictions. That $1.35 billion is only 2.9% of $46.6 billion. But the actual Q3 percentage will be smaller because Nvidia's revenue will be higher in Q3 than Q1.\n\nA revenue loss of somewhere between 2% to 3% of total sales is a very minor speed bump. Moreover, it's a much better situation than having no H20 sales.\n\nHow will Nvidia's profitability be affected by this deal?\n\nGiving the government a 15% cut of H20 sales revenue should also negatively affect Nvidia's bottom line. But it should be an extremely minor dent, because Nvidia's data center platform is amazingly profitable. On that note, Nvidia overall is amazingly profitable.\n\nNvidia doesn't break out its profitability by platform, so we'll have to use its overall numbers. In Q1, Nvidia's adjusted gross margin (gross profit divided by revenue) absent the $4.5 billion H20-related charge was 71.3%. The company provided its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) absent the charge, so I could calculate adjusted net income absent the charge and then from that calculate adjusted net profit margin (net income divided by revenue) absent the charge -- which would have been 56.1%.\n\nIn other words, Nvidia converts more than half of its revenue into adjusted profits in a typical quarter, which is just phenomenal. It can easily absorb slightly less profitability on its H20 chips, which, again, account for roughly 15% of its total revenue in a typical quarter.\n\nIn short, Nvidia stock's strong upward trajectory should not be hurt by the company having to give the government a slice of its H20 sales.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:16:08.788247+00:00"}

A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.\n\nThe arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees, according to shipping giant Maersk.\n\nIn a Monday press conference, President Trump described the agreement with Nvidia as a deal that would benefit the nation. He described meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of agreeing to the export license; Mr. Trump didn't mention AMD in his comments.\n\n\"So I said, 'I want 20% if I'm going to approve it for you,'\" Mr. Trump said of his meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of the export license. \"I don't want it myself, so when I say I want 20%, it's for the country.\"\n\n\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.\n\nThe revenue-sharing plan comes after the White House announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and MI308 chips from rival chipmaker AMD to China. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month said it had won approval from the Trump administration to sell its H20 chips to China.\n\nThe H20 chip, which is specialized for artificial intelligence applications, was developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market, while AMD's MI308 chips are also geared for AI.\n\nIt is unclear how the Trump administration would use the money generated from the chip sales agreement.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on the specifics of the deal. In a statement, a spokesperson said, \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.

Stocks for both companies rose slightly on Monday.\n\nProponents of restrictions on sales of advanced chips to China say they are necessary to ensure the U.S. maintains a competitive edge as the two countries battle for AI dominance. They've also been viewed as a security safeguard. In one instance during the Biden administration, the Commerce Department said it was updating its export controls and said advanced AI capabilities \"present U.S. national security concerns.\"\n\n\"These controls were strategically crafted to address, among other concerns, the PRC's efforts to obtain semiconductor manufacturing equipment essential to producing advanced integrated circuits needed for the next generation of advanced weapon systems,\" the department said in a 2023 release.\n\ncontributed to this report.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:16:10.643635+00:00"}

Plug Power’s recent performance marks a sharp pivot from its five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 12.6% over the last two years. Plug Power isn’t alone in its struggles as the Renewable Energy industry experienced a cyclical downturn, with many similar businesses observing lower sales at this time.\n\nPlug Power Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\n\nThis quarter, Plug Power reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 21.4%, and its $174 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 10.4%.\n\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 23.7% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years.

And you also mentioned earlier, Ali, that this is really about uh or separately from the Nvidia AMD. I actually think they're potentially linked. I mean, think about the timing of the news coming out over the weekend, plus this truce or this pause, if you will, uh you got to you got to think that something was going on in the back end with both of these, with the countries and these private companies. I I do think though, from everything that we've seen from the second administration, these types of delays are the norm, but this new deal between the private and public sector, this is definitely something new and shocking. Shocking.\n\n01:12 Speaker B\n\nYeah, I hope you brought up that AMD video news and Dan, I want to bring you into this conversation, Nvidia, AMD, China chips, two companies that will give 15% of their China chip revenue to the US government. What kind of financial impact could a deal like this have on their bottom lines? And it got me thinking is handing over around three billion or so in change to the government worth it if it means resuming sales to China?\n\n02:00 Dan Howley\n\nYeah, so so far uh analysts are saying uh this is kind of, you know, the price of doing business uh almost. If it gets them back into the Chinese market, then that's huge. Uh they're not seating it to uh the likes of Huawei, uh they're ensuring that uh Nvidia and AMD are still in there. I think one of the things that folks pointed out was, look, yes, it is 15% of sales, but it's better than nothing. Uh the other thing is that uh there could be a new precedent that's being set here and that's on the downside, you know, does this mean that other companies will have to pay and what does that mean for for other chip manufacturers that want to sell into the Chinese market? So I think it's it's kind of a double edge uh double edge sword at this point. Uh when you look at Nvidia overall though, you know, you're you're talking about uh like you said, $3 billion dollars. It's not a huge hit to them, uh especially since right now, they're not accounting for any China revenue. Uh and they were expected to have uh take a hit on tariffs in the current quarter uh in addition to the the hit they took last quarter. So, you know, we could see this start to pick up when they start to ramp back up as far as selling in. Now, it seems as though we're we're starting to get that kind of ball rolling when the the announcement came that they were going to be able to start selling again about a month ago. It seems like it's going to start in relatively short order. I say relative because the chip industry moves slowly, but you know, it could be something that we start to see maybe in Q3, maybe in Q4 on the balance sheets.\n\n04:38 Speaker B\n\nAnd Dan, you're just talking about some of that analyst commentary, the precedent that this could set. What do you think this means for the wider semiconductor supply chain?\n\n04:52 Dan Howley\n\nI think it means they have to be aware that this is a possibility for them as well. It's not just uh Nvidia, it's not just AMD. Uh if you're going to be selling chips into a market like China that are high-powered, um I mean, not even necessarily high power, the ones they sell into China are uh degraded compared to what they they have for uh the US and uh its allies. But I think if you're selling a chip that deals in this kind of area, a sensitive area like AI, you may have to pay this kind of fee to be able to continue to play in that space and and generate that revenue.\n\n05:44 Speaker B\n\nAnd Hope, what's your opinion and thought on the precedent that this sets? Not just for these big tech companies, but maybe some of those smaller players as well.\n\n05:54 Speaker A\n\nYeah, and I think it depends on how critical the companies are. I think Nvidia, AMD are critical to the global supply chain of AI. I think if you look at software makers, if you look at other types of companies, if they are not as critical, I don't think these deals will actually come to fruition. One thing I think a lot of investors should be looking out for is just how much of this cost is actually passed on to China. So if Nvidia and AMD are now having to pay the US 15% of those sales of those new advanced chips through the new export controls being lifted, uh if if China can pay, of course, they will then boost the top line for both of these companies. I think the bigger picture here, the big macro picture here is that both of these companies are basically ping pong balls in this trade war in the geopolitical tensions. Again, I mentioned at the top here that the timing of the of the tariff uh being put on pause for for China is coming around the same time that this announcement is being made. I I really I really don't think that that's a coincidence, and I do think we need to look at the timing very, very closely to see exactly where the demonstration is thinking about placing all the chips on their board.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:16:30.980226+00:00"}

Nvidia shares were little changed.\n\nChina’s government, meanwhile, has grown increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese firms deploying the H20 and is unlikely to warm to the idea of a chip tax. Yuyuantantian, a social media account affiliated with state-run China Central Television that regularly signals Beijing’s thinking about trade, on Sunday slammed what it described as security vulnerabilities and inefficiencies of Nvidia’s chip.\n\nThere’s no guarantee the arrangement with Nvidia and AMD will succeed. Trade experts said it’s vulnerable to legal challenges because it could be construed as an export tax, something that’s not allowed under the Constitution. The chipmakers themselves said it will take months to revive production of the parts — assuming Chinese customers even opt for dated components.\n\nThe chip companies’ consent to cede part of chip sales underscores the urgency of their desire to cater to customers in the world’s second-largest economy. The US government has cut off sales of the most capable AI chips, arguing that China might use them for military purposes, instead allowing shipment of only pared-back products. But the Trump administration has consistently relented on trade conditions in exchange for financial concessions — and in this case officials said the chips are not the most advanced, playing down their national security implications.\n\nTrump said he’d originally told Nvidia that he wanted a 20% cut for the US if he cleared H20 sales to China but eventually settled for a 15% share.

The big question is exactly when they’re going to start delivering to China again, especially now that there are strings attached, Goldberg said.\n\nThe deal also threatens to undermine the US argument that some trade controls are necessary to safeguard national security, said Jacob Feldgoise, a researcher at the DC-based Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “This seeming quid pro quo is unprecedented from an export-control perspective,” he said. “The arrangement risks invalidating the national security rationale for US export controls.”\n\nWATCH: Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China to the US government. Tom Mackenzie has the details.Source: Bloomberg\n\nWhen the Trump administration first decided to grant export licenses to Nvidia and AMD last month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said exports of H20 chips were part of trade talks with China and were used as “a negotiating chip.” White House AI adviser David Sacks emphasized at the time that the product wasn’t “the latest and greatest.”\n\nTrump reiterated these points at the briefing on Monday, calling Nvidia’s H20 “an old chip” and hailing the company’s latest Blackwell chip as the “super duper advanced” one. He signaled though that he’d be open to negotiate another deal with Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to sell a scaled-back version of the most advanced Blackwell chip to China, too. “I think he’s coming to see me again about that,” Trump said.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said the company follows US export rules, adding that while it hasn’t shipped H20 chips to China for months, it hopes the regulations will allow US companies to compete in China. AMD similarly said in a statement Monday that it’s adhering to all US export-control laws.\n\nThe US government has meanwhile begun approving export licenses for the chips. AMD’s initial license applications have been cleared, the company said Monday. The Financial Times earlier reported on the revenue-sharing deal.\n\nTrump has targeted chipmakers in the past week with a series of declarations that were light on specifics and rattled companies from Silicon Valley to Asia. On Wednesday, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on imported chips, unless companies also made investments on US soil. On examination, though, those new tariffs would apply to almost no one since most major chipmakers appear to be covered by existing investments or separate trade deals.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump called on Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan to resign, describing the Malaysia-born entrepreneur as “highly conflicted” without giving details. Tan, who sent a letter to employees assuring them that he had engaged with the administration, is expected to meet with Trump on Monday, a person familiar with the situation said. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the meeting.\n\nTan has been targeted by Republican Senator Tom Cotton over historical business ties to China.\n\nHuang has lobbied long and hard for the lifting of restrictions, arguing that walling China off will only slow the spread of American technology and encourage local rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co. In yet another sign that his message is getting through to the White House, Trump described Huang on Monday as a “great,” “very brilliant guy.”\n\nThe tax is expected to funnel some capital to the US — but not an enormous amount in relative terms. Both Nvidia and AMD have said it’ll take time to ramp back up production of their China-specific products — even if order levels return to previous levels, which is uncertain.\n\nWATCH: Michael Kratsios, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, comments on plans for location tracking for chips.Bloomberg: The Asia Trade”.\n\nNvidia raked in $4.6 billion of revenue from the H20 in the fiscal quarter ended April 27 — days after new restrictions on shipping the AI accelerator to China were imposed.\n\nIt also said it had been unable to ship $2.5 billion of H20 China revenue in that period because of the new rules. That implies it would have got more than $7 billion in H20 sales to China during the period. If it can return to that level, the US government will stand to get about a billion dollars a quarter from its deal.\n\nAMD could generate $3 billion to $5 billion of 2025 revenue if restrictions were lifted, Morgan Stanley estimates. Chinese alternatives such as Huawei’s Ascend chips now account for 20% to 30% of domestic demand, it reckoned.\n\n“The US government clearly needs the money given its deficits and eagerness to collect tariffs,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. “But the complication is China’s accusations about H20 chips containing back doors, which could be a negotiation tactic to highlight that the country is not ‘hard up’ for US chips.”\n\nFor its part, Nvidia emphasized that its H20 chip is “not a military product or for government infrastructure.” China has “ample supply of domestic chips,” the company said in an emailed statement. “It won’t and never has relied on Americans chips for government operations, just like the US government would not rely on chips from China.”\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu, Emily Forgash, Winnie Hsu, Jessica Sui, Wendy Benjaminson, Kevin Whitelaw, Shadab Nazmi and Yasufumi Saito.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:16:37.598035+00:00"}

He's made these concessions. Uh he very very much wants to do more business in China. Intel in the past has done exactly the same thing. Uh I think if they're not giving their latest and greatest technology to the Chinese, it may be okay. I'm very wary about giving American technology to China where we're in a big race, particularly AI technology. But uh I think it's, we'll see. My big concern is this is going to spread not just to semiconductor, it's going to spread to other industries. Will we see in pharma where there's a a pay to play so to speak that the US administration will be taking a share of that because the technology research was done in the US. And I I would be very very concerned about that. We seem to be developing much more of a mercantilist approach to our companies and and walking right up if not crossing over the line to separation between government and free enterprise. That's my biggest concern, Julie.\n\n02:43 Speaker A\n\nAnd Bill, you know, even if Terry is right that this this particular type of structure of deal is a one-off, to your point, we have seen a whole host of different flavors of that mercantilist approach that you're talking about. What in your view are the risks of that approach?\n\n03:22 Bill\n\nWell, that we don't have a line between government and capitalism, as you see in many other countries. And I think that's a big concern. How far do you go? The president just advocated not directed the firing of Intel CEO with no evidence that he uh, yes, he has connections in China. So does Tim Cook, so does Elon Musk. But that should not be a prima fascia evidence for firing him. So I see the the CEO of Intel is hustling into the White House today to try to make peace with the president. But how far will this go? That's my concern and how much direction will there be to private industry about how to run this company? We have the golden share of Nippon Steel. And so the president's clearly taking an investment if you will, on behalf of the government in in a lot of industries. And I'm concerned, you know, we're just at the start of this administration. How far is that going to go? And we'll see. And also, the commitments being made, huge. I mean, like Apple, $100 billion on top of $500 billion. Uh enormous in four years. A lot of that won't play out till the end of the administration, but I think these tariffs, no, I think is going to take effect much sooner.\n\n05:28 Speaker A\n\nAnd and Terry, you know, sort of what we hear Bill describing there. What are the implications for investors, both in the case of AMD and NVIDIA, but also just sort of the the way that companies need to approach this administration in the future? From an investment perspective, what do people need to think about?\n\n06:03 Terry\n\nWell, take this NVIDIA AMD story with the 15%. Put it to, put it to the side for one second. What you've got though, is a situation where there is much more government direction and aspiration to direct the economy than there was before. The administration has been crystal clear about that. And as a matter of, as a matter of United States policy, as a matter of national security policy. One of Belsen's mantras has been for months that US National Security Policy is United States economic policy. Economic policy is national security policy. You have a situation here where they're doing everything they can, including providing huge incentives to the the manufacturing industry to onshore, to put to use tariffs in part to push different industries to onshore critical materials and and goods and the like. They've done everything short of invoking the Defense Production Act, which would essentially harness industry to government aims. Why are they doing that? Because they're, they are urgent about the nature of the Chinese challenge and how relatively speaking, how little time they think they have to write the ship. Uh and frankly, harness industry to to right size the economy to meet the Chinese challenge. That's what they think. They've been very transparent about that. And I would I would imagine that would continue and frankly, accelerate.

The result: an extraordinary concession from a $4.5 trillion corporation that will give the United States a percentage of every high-end AI chip sold in China.\n\nThe deal, which AMD also signed for some of its chips, could split the difference between two competing Trump administration goals: maintain America’s AI dominance while securing a critical trade agreement with China. It could also give the White House billions of dollars to spend as it wishes.\n\nWhat Nvidia agreed to\n\nNvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China in exchange for licenses to export their technology there.\n\nThe White House in April blocked the export of certain AI chips to China, including Nvidia’s H20 chips and AMD’s MI308 chips. The deal with the Trump administration allows the companies to obtain export licenses to restart sales of those chips in China, a US official told CNN. The Financial Times first reported the story Sunday.\n\nNvidia previewed the deal last month, when it said it would resume sales of the H20 chip to China after the Trump administration expressed openness to allowing the export of certain AI chips again. But the 15% payment was a surprise. Trump said Nvidia was initially asked to pay a 20% cut, but they negotiated the rate down to 15%.\n\nThe deal came together after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, the official said. Although the export licenses were granted Friday, no shipments have yet been made.\n\n“We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”\n\nAMD has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nHow extraordinary is this?\n\nGovernments, including the United States, have taken control of companies in the past when they were considered to be of strategic importance to national security. During the financial crisis in 2009, the United States took control of General Motors and Chrysler, and the proceeds of those stakes went directly into the US Treasury after the government sold them for a profit.\n\nBut it’s not clear that the US government has ever demanded a percentage of a company’s business without taking an equity stake – or if it’s even legal to do so.\n\nThe US Constitution forbids taxes on exports. To get around that, the deal’s terms have been structured as a voluntary agreement, so it won’t be considered a tax or a tariff, a US official said. Instead, Nvidia and AMD will voluntarily send funds to the US government. The companies will have no say whatsoever on how the US government deploys that money after it is sent.\n\n“It’s hard to identify any historical precedent for this sort of arrangement,” said Sarah Kreps, law professor and director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University’s Brooks School of Public Policy.\n\nWhat about national security?\n\nIn recent years, the US government has sought to restrict China’s access to advanced American technology in an effort to slow its progress on AI and let the United States get farther ahead. But the White House’s reversal on export controls may be an acknowledgement that China is advancing in AI regardless, so American companies might as well be allowed to benefit. It could also give the White House another way to raise revenue for the US government, along with tariffs.\n\n“It seems like there’s been some vacillation within the administration about and toward China, and I think that reflects the internal divide within the administration between the China hawks and the economic pragmatists,” Kreps said. “It seems like increasingly, the economic pragmatists are holding sway.”\n\nThat approach would align with arguments from Nvidia’s Huang, who has said that restricting sales of American AI chips is bad for US national security. Chinese developers could simply undermine US leadership by creating their own alternatives if they can’t buy American technology, according to Huang, who has met with Trump repeatedly in recent months.\n\nThe White House agrees with Huang, believing it’s better to have China locked into a US-made chip sold through legitimate channels than to force China to the black market, a US official said. China has been able to subvert existing channels to obtain restricted chips anyway.\n\nWhy is Trump charging 15%?\n\nBig questions remain about where the 15% commission idea emerged and what it could mean for national security.\n\nA US official said that the payment allows the administration to maintain control of the export process and bring in revenue for the US government in the process. Still, it’s not clear that the penalty for Nvidia and AMD will effectively limit the flow of the chips or erase any potential national security issues.\n\n“If there’s a legitimate national security concern about exporting these chips to China, then I don’t see how the payments to the US government address those risks. In fact, they don’t at all,” said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And if there’s not a sufficient national security risk or they can be adequately mitigated … then the US government should just get out of the way and expect nothing in return.”\n\nWhat does this mean for Nvidia?\n\nNvidia released the H20 chip last year as a way to maintain access to the Chinese market — which made up 13% of the company’s sales in 2024 — in the face of US export controls imposed by the Biden administration.\n\nBut the chips are widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek, an advanced Chinese AI model that shook Silicon Valley upon its release earlier this year, raising concerns that China was further ahead on AI than previously understood.\n\nAfter the Trump administration barred H20 sales to China in April, Nvidia said it took billions of dollars in charges and lost revenue because of the export controls in the first quarter and projected a similar outcome in the second quarter.\n\nSo, even if it has to fork over 15% of those sales to the White House, resuming shipments of the H20 to China could mean billions more dollars in revenue for Nvidia — which became the first publicly traded company to top $4 trillion in valuation last month. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose as much as 0.5% on Monday.\n\nCombined, Nvidia and AMD could earn as much as $35 billion in annual revenue from sales of their H20 and MI380 chips to China, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino’s estimates. That means the White House would earn around $5 billion in revenue. “We acknowledge the tax will have a negative impact on profit margins tied to China sales but view the reentry into the second-largest GPU market to be worth the cost,” Zino said in emailed commentary Monday.\n\nHow important are these chips?\n\nTrump on Monday called Nvidia’s H20 chip “obsolete,” saying that China “already has it in a different form.”\n\nBut some experts disagree with Trump’s characterization of the chips.\n\n“These H20s are still state of the art,” CSIS’s Kennedy said. Although they’re less advanced, in some ways, than other Nvidia chips, “they also come with elements that make them extremely sophisticated and valuable,” including their memory capabilities.\n\nNvidia’s H20 chip is also good at inference, says Param Singh, professor of business technologies and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University, which refers to the process an AI model goes through when answering a question.\n\nBut Nvidia’s H100 and H200 series chips, as well as its Blackwell line of chips, are much more powerful and better equipped to train large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-5 he says. It’s not the same as calling it obsolete, but using a chip like the H20 instead could mean it might take longer to train cutting edge AI models.\n\n“There’s a huge difference in the amount of calculations that an H100 chip could do versus an H20,” he said.\n\nNvidia likely reasoned that there is enough Chinese demand for the chips to make the 15% commission to the White House a worthwhile trade-off for its business, according to Kreps. “You have to do a calculation based on what was lost from the export controls,” she said.\n\nWill Trump approve more advanced chips?\n\nTrump on Monday left open the possibility that Nvidia could export its super high-end Blackwell chips for a higher price. The Trump administration had closed the door on the export of that technology to China — even after reversing course on the H20.\n\nHowever, Trump on Monday said that he’d consider allowing Nvidia to sell the Blackwell chip.\n\n“The Blackwell is superduper advanced. I wouldn’t make a deal with that, although it’s possible,” Trump said. “I’d make a deal a somewhat enhanced in a negative way. Blackwell, in other words, take 30% to 50% off of it, but that’s the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won’t have it for five years.”\n\nTrump said Huang will return to the White House in the future to discuss selling an “unenhanced” version of Blackwell.\n\n“I think he’s coming to see me again about that, but that will be a unenhanced version of the big one,” Trump said. “You know, we will sometimes sell fighter jets to a country and we’ll give them 20% less than we have.”\n\nWhat does China want?\n\nQuestions from Beijing about the security of American AI chips also raise uncertainty about just how successful Trump’s commission policy could be.\n\nChina could choose not to buy US tech firm Nvidia’s H20 chips, the social media account Yuyuan Tantian, which is affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, said on Sunday. It claimed that the chips could have “backdoors” that impact their function and security, following previous similar claims from China’s cybersecurity administration. Nvidia has repeatedly denied that its products have backdoors.\n\nHowever, that statement could be less an indication that China won’t buy American chips and more a signal to Chinese tech companies to continue innovating in semiconductors even if US shipments do resume, Kennedy said.\n\nWhat does this mean for a broader trade deal?\n\nFor the Trump administration, the cost-benefit analysis is that it opens up the flow of mid-tier chips to China while giving the administration a key bargaining chip in its ongoing trade talks, a US official said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called Nvidia export controls a “negotiating chip” in the larger US-China trade talks.\n\nBut China knows that, and its posturing over supposed security concerns with the H20 chip this weekend suggests that it won’t be won over so easily — even if it wants the chips for its market.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:16:49.611682+00:00"}

In exchange for the profit sharing, the US would grant export licenses allowing Nvidia to resume sales of its H20 chips to China and AMD to resume sales of its MI308 chips to China.\n\nBut legal experts say that neither the president nor Congress is empowered to tax exports. Article I, Section 9, of the US Constitution, known as the Export Clause, prohibits such levies, saying, \"No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.”\n\nNvidia stock fell 0.2% in Tuesday premarket trading, while AMD hovered above the flat line.\n\n“The Constitution is clear that there really cannot be any tax on exports,” said Douglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer with Jacobson Burton Kelley. “In my view, it's a slam-dunk unconstitutional tax on exports.”\n\nAnd the US Supreme Court has interpreted the Export Clause to prohibit Congress from imposing duties on exports, even when they’re characterized otherwise.\n\nIts controlling view on federally mandated export charges was stated in the unanimous 1998 decision in United States v. United States Shoe Corp.\n\nIn that case, the high court struck down a congressionally approved ad valorem charge of 0.125% on exports imposed by the US Customs Service. The charge, calculated based on the value of commercial cargo shipped through US ports, known as the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT), was intended to fund upkeep on US harbors.\n\nOn behalf of former President Bill Clinton’s administration, the US Solicitor General argued that the HMT was a “user fee,” and not a tax. But the court disagreed, reasoning that because the charge operated like an export tax, it violated the Export Clause.\n\nSiding with US Shoe, the court said in its opinion that the HMT “bears the indicia of a tax.”\n\nBeyond the Constitution’s export tax prohibition, the Export Controls Reform Act, passed by Congress in 2018, specifically prohibits charging exporters to obtain export licenses.\n\nPay to play?

Trump made the assertion about Blackwell while confirming that he’d hammered out a separate unusual deal with Nvidia that will allow the company to sell its less-advanced H20 AI chip to China if it pays 15% of revenue tied to those shipments to the US government. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will deliver the same share from MI308 revenues, a person familiar with the situation has said, asking not to be identified discussing internal deliberations.\n\nThe revenue-sharing agreement for the H20 chip — and the prospect of yet another one for Nvidia’s Blackwell product — reflects Trump’s consistent effort to engineer a financial payout for America in return for concessions on trade. Such unprecedented arrangements, however, stand to set a precedent for all American companies doing business in the Asian nation and threaten the US government’s national security rationale for export controls, experts said.\n\nTrump didn’t say exactly when he might negotiate a deal with Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang on the Blackwell chip but alluded to a possible meeting soon on the prospect: “I think he’s coming to see me again about that, but that will be a unenhanced version of the big one.”\n\nNvidia’s Blackwell design is at the heart of the most powerful computers that create and run AI software.

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nIntel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 32 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock dropped 3.1% on the news that the U.S. jobs report for July came in significantly weaker than expected while new widespread import tariffs were announced, sparking fears of a potential economic slowdown. The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs, far below estimates, and massive downward revisions to the prior two months painted a much weaker picture of the labor market. This has stoked recession fears, which would directly impact demand for chips used in countless products. Compounding these worries, the White House announced new tariffs, including a 20% levy on imports from Taiwan, a global hub for chip manufacturing. This dual shock of slowing domestic growth and renewed trade friction creates a challenging outlook for the highly cyclical and globally connected semiconductor industry, leading to a broad-based sell-off.\n\nIntel is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $21.12 per share, it is still trading 22.9% below its 52-week high of $27.39 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $438.16.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

Uh, well, we still haven't worked out the rare earths part of this, so I'm not sure that the chip, uh, the chip things is ever going to get done. Secondly, I think you've, you've, you're seeing on a broader scale here, tech humbled, right? It's, uh, uh, Trump apparently, uh, the last criteria here is a 15%, uh, payment out the door, uh, on the one hand, uh, a strategy which I think would probably depress exports if it was, uh, administered more widely. And on the other hand, the Chinese are saying, uh, apparently that they don't want the chip after all, because they're afraid of back doors, which puts the tech industry in a position of having to show that there's no back doors and in the bargain, where they might put back doors. So, uh, you know, you've got a situation here where this isn't really good for tech, uh, no matter how it, how it slices. Uh, finally, I think the Trump people probably end up with this is a one off.

Now, as we know, uh, Nvidia already made a different version of its chips in order to try to get access to China. Reportedly, it was going to get the okay for those export licenses, but now the reports are coming that it had to agree to pay this first.\n\n00:25 Dan\n\nYeah, it's it's a rather interesting uh, agreement uh, if if it all comes uh, kind of together the way it's it's been reported at this point that 15% of the revenue that they would get from China sales going to uh, the the administration basically. Uh, I mean, obviously, anything that assures that Nvidia and AMD will be able to sell into China, people will take. Um, you know, these are uh, some of their most important uh, countries that they or one of the most important countries that they sell into. Uh, you know, obviously, when when there was the ban in place, investors kind of were down at first, and then they were kind of saying, okay, well, you know, now that that revenue is removed, it's it's no longer a guessing game as to what kind of revenue the the company's going to be bringing in. We we just know it's going to be what what it's going to be. But now, uh, with China kind of back in play and then seemingly this ensuring that they'll be able to sell chips, you can imagine that that investors will be happier about that. Uh, but you have to wonder how much in the end, uh, the companies will end up having to turn over just to make sure that they get to sell the chips, period.\n\n02:12 Speaker A\n\nYeah, I I just want to mention as well that we did get a statement from Nvidia about all of this, and they didn't directly confirm the reports. What they said was, we follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. We while we haven't shipped H200 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide. America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America's AI tech stack can be the world standard if we race. And this has been sort of reportedly the position of Jensen Wong, the the case that he made to the president that the US needed to stay in China in order to stay competitive. So interesting on that front. But Dan, I do want to follow up and ask you about what's going on with Intel and its CEO, Lipu Tan, who is reportedly going to be meeting with Trump today on a very different issue.\n\n03:28 Dan\n\nYeah, this is basically Trump trying to oust him. Uh, he said that he had to leave the company uh, that he was, you know, quote-unquote very conflicted. And this kind of goes back to his days with cadence. Uh, cadence just settled a uh suit with the government basically saying that they had provided some materials to a university that the government believes has links to the Chinese military. And so, you know, they settled, uh, and then Senator Tom Cotton had come forward and said, look, you know, this is this is a big deal. Uh, someone should, you know, look deeper into this. Uh, Lipu Tan has some investments in Chinese companies. Uh, he is a US citizen. Uh, and so, you know, there's this kind of back and forth as to, you know, does does do his prior uh, you know, kind of instances of investing in Chinese companies make him uh, good for being Intel CEO or or not?", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:17:29.848960+00:00"}

During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Advanced Micro falls in, has gained 0.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $1.11 per share, indicating a change of +20.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.95 points to a change of +19.3% from the prior year.

So, well, it looks like Wall Street's bull run looks set to continue. Remember last week, the Nasdaq hit two consecutive record highs while the S&P 500 narrowly missed its own record high on Friday. Big tech was firmly in focus last week with Apple posting its best week since 2020. And our first thing you need to know before that opening bell rings is again focused on tech. In what can only be described as an unusual agreement, Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay 15% of their China chip sale revenue to the US government. Why? Well, it's seen as one way the firms can secure export licenses from the Trump administration that were granted last week. Shares of both were down in the pre-market as you can see here. Now, Nvidia will give a share of its revenues from the sale of its H20 chip sales in China, while AMD will do the same for the sale of its MI308 chips. The arrangement reflects US President Donald Trump's consistent effort to engineer a financial payout for America in return for concessions on trade. His administration has shown a willingness to relax trade conditions like tariffs in return for giant investments in the US. Beijing, which has grown increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese firms deploying the H20 is unlikely to warm to the idea of a chip tax.

They're going to be discussing cooperation between Intel and the US government. The Intel boss's personal and professional experience is also likely to come under the spotlight. Remember last week, the president called for Tan to resign amid suspicions of a conflict of interest. And remember, Trump ally, Tom Cotton, sent a letter to the Intel CEO questioning Tan's investments in Chinese companies. And the final thing you need to know before the opening bell rings is that Chinese electric battery maker, manufacturing firm, CATL has suspended production at one of its lithium mines in China. The move came after its mining license expired on Saturday. This sent the price of lithium futures soaring in China as well as stocks related to met, the metal needed to run electric cars.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:17:48.463163+00:00"}

Two AI businesses to consider are ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%), since they provide key hardware to the industry.\n\nThe former makes cutting-edge lithography machines, which are necessary for producing the advanced microchips that power AI systems. AMD, one of Nvidia's top competitors, sells AI chips to cloud computing companies such as Microsoft.\n\nASML and AMD are both strong businesses. But determining which is a better AI investment isn't simple. So let's evaluate them in more detail.\n\nA look into ASML\n\nASML's lithography equipment is essential for manufacturing AI microchips because the technology demands immense computing power. This necessitates shrinking chip components to minuscule dimensions. For instance, a microchip the size of your fingernail contains billions of transistors. ASML's machines support this.\n\nAlthough the Dutch company plays an important role in AI, its stock has struggled in 2025, remaining essentially flat through Aug. 6. Part of this is because management anticipates economic uncertainty ahead as a result of factors such as President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nEven so, ASML expects 2025 sales to rise 15% over 2024's 28.3 billion euros ($33 billion). This is significant since 2024's revenue represents only a 2.6% year-over-year increase. And so far this year, the company is doing well.\n\nThrough two quarters, revenue stood at $18 billion, up from the prior year's $13.4 billion. Operating income rose to $5.8 billion from 2024's $3.7 billion. This robust growth resulted in net income of $5.4 billion, a strong increase over the previous year's $3.3 billion.\n\nThe excellent first-half results were tempered by a third-quarter revenue forecast between $8.6 billion and $9.2 billion. This outlook, when compared to the prior year's sales of $8.9 billion, suggests the current trend of strong year-over-year growth may be slowing down, which contributed to ASML's tepid stock performance.\n\nHow AMD is faring\n\nLike rival Nvidia, AMD stock is having a stellar year. Shares are up 35% in 2025 through Aug. 6. This performance is understandable following the company's second-quarter earnings results. The quarter's revenue reached a record $7.7 billion, a 32% year-over-year increase.\n\nCEO Lisa Su said, \"We are seeing robust demand across our computing and AI product portfolio and are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year.\" In that second half, AMD expects revenue of $8.7 billion, a strong increase over the previous year's $6.8 billion.\n\nDespite the sales growth, AMD exited the second quarter with an operating loss of $134 million compared to operating income of $269 million in the previous year. The substantial drop was due to new U.S. government restrictions introduced earlier this year on the sale of AI chips to China. As a result, AMD could not sell chips it had intended for Chinese customers, forcing the company to write off that inventory by $800 million.\n\nYet this makes its second-quarter sales growth all the more impressive. In the quarter, net income was $872 million, up 229% year over year. Consequently, diluted earnings per share soared 238% to $0.54 in a boon to shareholders.\n\nAMD is working to get government approval to sell AI chips to China again. When that OK is obtained, the company is in a position to deliver more outsize sales growth.\n\nDeciding between ASML and AMD\n\nAMD's outstanding performance, its anticipated third-quarter revenue growth, and an eventual return of sales to China point to it being the superior AI stock versus ASML.\n\nHowever, an important consideration is share price valuation. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.\n\nThe top chart shows ASML's P/E ratio has declined over the past year, indicating its stock's valuation has improved. Compared to AMD's recently rising earnings multiple, as seen in the bottom chart, ASML shares look like a bargain.\n\nASML's short-term sales may slow due to the current macroeconomic uncertainty, but over the long run, it's likely to benefit from the rise of AI. The company sees the technology as a significant chance for growth in semiconductors, similar to previous opportunities like PCs, the internet, and smartphones.\n\nIndustry forecasts support ASML's perspective. The AI sector is projected to grow from $244 billion in 2025 to $1 trillion by 2031. While this market growth is a tailwind for both companies, ASML's attractive valuation makes it look like the more compelling AI stock to buy right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:17:56.696543+00:00"}

The products also use AI technology to improve the user interface, making it easy to use and simple to understand. The AI reads and responds in real text, based on natural language models; in practice, Palantir’s users don’t need to learn machine language or computer coding to communicate with the AI – they can simply enter their requests in clear text and receive responses the same way. The technology is also amenable to real-time translations, making Palantir’s products easy to market internationally – the system just needs to be told what language it is using, and its translation algorithms handle the rest.\n\nThe first AI stock we’ll look at here is one of the leaders in the field. Palantir is well-known for marrying AI technology and capabilities to the field of data analysis, a match that has matured into a solid product platform – AIP, or AI Platform – and a set of tools whose wide applicability has made them highly popular. Since its founding in 2003, Palantir has developed a reputation for innovation, and has built itself into a $441 billion giant of the AI industry.\n\nWith numbers like these, it’s no surprise that UBS analysts are combing through the sector to pinpoint the most promising AI stocks. Their latest deep dive zeroes in on two recent earnings reporters – Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) – to see which is the superior AI stock to buy. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nThis equals big money for the AI developers out there. Chip makers, AI app creators, data analysis firms – all of these and more have created an industry that was valued at $233 billion last year, and is estimated by Fortune Business Insights to hit $294 billion this year – and to show a CAGR of 29.2% through 2032, reaching $1.77 trillion that year.

More and more companies are turning to the technology to enhance all sorts of functions, from customer service to chatbots to high-level data analytics and even to decision-making processes. According to Fortune Business Insights, up to 35% of all businesses have integrated AI into their work models.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company’s products and capabilities have proven particularly popular in government use, especially in the Department of Defense. This is clear from the company’s frequent announcements of new projects; DoD contracts and partnerships are regularly featured. Two examples: in July, Palantir announced that it had entered into a joint program, Warp Speed for Warships, with BlueForge Alliance, to accelerate warship production, fleet readiness, and digital transformation for the US Navy. And in June, the company launched a strategic partnership with Accenture, for the deployment of commercial-grade, AI-powered solutions designed to meet the high-priority operational challenges across a wide range of Federal agencies.\n\nIn its last quarterly report, covering 2Q25, the company announced a series of strong gains in key metrics. The company’s customer count was up 43% year-over-year, providing a base that supported a 48% YoY jump in revenue, to $1.004 billion – marking Palantir’s first billion-dollar quarter and beating the forecast by $60.5 million. At the bottom line, Palantir realized non-GAAP earnings of 16 cents per share, 2 cents per share better than had been expected. The company’s quarterly adjusted free cash flow came to $569 million, which represented a margin of 57%. And the company finished the quarter with cash and liquid assets totaling $6 billion.\n\nAbout the only thing that has grown faster than Palantir’s financial markers was the company’s share price. Year-to-date, shares in Palantir have far outpaced the broader markets. PLTR trades on the NASDAQ, which is up 11% so far this year, and it is a component of the S&P 500 index, which is up 9%; at the same time, for the year-to-date, PLTR has gained an impressive 147%. For the past three years, the stock’s gain is over 1,849%.\n\nCovering Palantir for UBS, 5-star analyst Karl Keirstead notes the company’s strong performance, yet he finds it impossible to ignore its high valuation. He writes, “Palantir reported its 8th straight quarter of revs growth acceleration, a turnaround that we’ve never seen before, from 13% growth in 2Q23 to a 2Q25 growth rate of 48%, while at a $4 billion revs scale. Palantir raised the full year 2025 total growth guidance to 45% from 36%, without compromising on the non-GAAP margin target, which was inched up to 46%. Palantir is benefiting from a confluence of mega-trends in AI application development, investments at the data layer and the modernization of defense tech, but valuation at 136x CY26E FCF remains our key hurdle…”\n\nThat hurdle leads Keirstead to rate PLTR as Neutral (i.e., Hold). His price target on the stock is $165, implying a one-year downside of ~12%. (To watch Keirstead’s track record, click here)\n\nThe Street generally would seem to agree with the UBS view. PLTR has a Hold consensus rating, based on 19 recent analyst reviews that include 4 to Buy, 13 to Hold, and 2 to Sell. The shares are priced at $186.96 and have an average price target of $152.12, suggesting that the share price will fall by ~19% in the next 12 months. (See PLTR stock forecast)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nNext up on the AI stage is AMD, a fast-rising contender steadily climbing the semiconductor ranks with a solid growth streak. It may not yet belong to the trillion-dollar club alongside Nvidia, Broadcom, and TSMC, but with a market cap near $280 billion, AMD is far from a lightweight. Over the past four quarters, it has pulled in roughly $30 billion in revenue, powered by a diverse portfolio spanning PCs, gaming rigs, and the surging AI/data-center market. Here, AMD isn’t merely keeping pace – it’s going toe-to-toe with Nvidia in AI accelerators and challenging Intel in PC microprocessors.\n\nThat competitive edge has been sharpened in recent years as AMD shifted from its roots in PCs and gaming toward a bigger slice of the AI pie. The company now offers a broad lineup of AI solutions across CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing, with the flexibility to tailor products for specific customer needs – whether in data centers, at the edge, or in enterprise applications. This diversification isn’t just theoretical; it’s showing up in high-profile wins and an expanding product pipeline.\n\nIn June, AMD landed Nokia as a customer for its 5th generation EPYC processors, which will power the Nokia Cloud Platform – a deal that underscores the broad applicability of its technology. Just a month earlier, AMD unveiled new high-performance computing products, including the Radeon RX 9060 XT and Radeon AI PRO R9700 graphics cards, plus the Ryzen Threadripper 9000 Series processors, targeting growth in gaming, content creation, and AI workloads.\n\nIn 2Q25, AMD reported gains in both AI-related and gaming sales, with AI/data center sales climbing 14% YoY to $3.2 billion and gaming revenue surging 73% to $1.1 billion. Client revenue hit a record $2.5 billion, up 67% vs. the previous year, helping overall revenue climb 32% to $7.685 billion, thereby beating the estimates by $260 million. Non-GAAP EPS came in at 48 cents, in line with expectations, while cash on hand totaled $4.44 billion. For Q3, AMD anticipates revenue of ~$8.7 billion, with a possible variation of $300 million, compared to the $8.32 billion consensus estimate.\n\nThat performance has caught the eye of UBS’s Timothy Arcuri, an analyst who ranks in 6th spot amongst the thousands of Street stock experts, who sees reasons for both caution and optimism.\n\n“AMD beat (on revenue) and guided above, but only to about where investor expectations were into the print. The bear would say that the beat was largely gaming-driven and while data center GPU is seeing a strong inflection in 2H, this was already baked into expectations and AMD did not raise the full year outlook for data center GPU despite all of the hyperscaler capex increases. In the very near-term, this may carry the day, but we think the path of travel for the business – and ultimately the stock – remains in a positive direction.”\n\nLaying out a supporting case for buying in, the 5-star analyst goes on to say, “First, excluding China, AMD’s data center GPU business is growing at a rate roughly similar to NVDA in C2H:25… Second, the outlook for market share growth in both the server and desktop portion of the CPU business is very strong with INTC’s roadmap under duress – combined, these are ~35% of AMD’s revenue and accretive to margins. Third, we would like to see gross margin inflecting quicker, but the underlying trends are still up and to the right with AMD able to at least hold GM flat even in CQ3 where the mix is unfavorable.”\n\nThat conviction earned AMD a Buy rating from Arcuri, who set a $210 price target – pointing to a potential 21.5% gain over the next year. (To watch Arcuri’s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, AMD boasts a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 37 analyst reviews that break down to 25 Buys and 12 Holds. The stock’s current trading price of $172.76 is slightly below the $180.78 average target price, implying a modest one-year upside of ~5%.

Critics argued that as well as denting the profits of US firms, restricting access to the Chinese market provided an added incentive for China’s domestic industry to innovate.\n\nThe new pledges from AMD and Nvidia are unusual, as no US company has ever agreed to pay a portion of their revenues to obtain export licences.\n\nEven so, this brand of dealmaking is becoming increasingly characteristic of firms dealing with the Trump administration. The president is notably encouraging companies to invest in the US to obtain more favourable tariff rates.\n\nLast week, Apple said it would invest another $100bn (€85.8bn) in the country, adding to a previous pledge to spend $500bn (€429bn) in the US over the next four years.\n\nThe announcement came as President Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on computer chips, only sparing companies that commit to “building” on US soil.\n\nThe easing of chip export restrictions has also arrived as relations between Washington and Beijing have thawed in recent weeks.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration threatened a 145% duty on Chinese goods sent to the US, and Beijing responded with a 125% retaliatory tariff. The two sides decided to lower these taxes in May, and then agreed on a trade framework in June.\n\nBoth China and the US are seeking to find a permanent solution to replace the temporary trade truce before a 12 August deadline.\n\nAMD did not immediately respond to Euronews’ request for comment.\n\nNvidia also said it couldn't confirm whether a portion of its revenues would be paid to the US government.\n\nA company spokesperson told Euronews: \"We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide. America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership.

Nvidia customised the H20 for the Chinese market after President Joe Biden imposed stringent export controls on more advanced chips utilised in artificial intelligence.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration announced a ban on H20 exports to China, but this decision was reversed in June following Huang’s meeting with Trump. Concerns arose for Nvidia as the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) had not issued any licences for weeks.\n\nHuang reportedly raised the licencing issue with Trump, leading to the issuance of licences shortly thereafter.\n\nNvidia stated: “While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide. America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America’s AI tech stack can be the world’s standard if we race.”\n\nThe ongoing debate in Washington regarding export control policies for chips coincides with US-China trade discussions, which Trump hopes will lead to a summit with President Xi Jinping.\n\nReports indicate that the commerce department has been instructed to halt new export controls on China to avoid straining relations with Beijing, particularly as China advocates for the relaxation of controls on high-bandwidth memory chips, essential for the production of advanced AI chips.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:18:08.676661+00:00"}

The stock is up almost 150% this year, a rally underpinned by the company’s growing use of artificial intelligence, business ties to the US government and most recently, a stellar earnings report.\n\nThat surge has made Palantir eye-wateringly expensive compared to its peers: trading at 245 times forward earnings, it is the most richly-valued company in the S&P 500 Index.

The valuation “causes heartburn, but that’s the story right now.”\n\nPlenty of Wall Street pros and retail investors alike are happy to hang on for now, wary of missing out on further upside. Still, it’s getting hard for them to ignore the increasingly high bar Palantir must meet to justify its performance over the longer term.

However, its shares took a dip following the announcement of its second-quarter results, after earnings came in a bit light.\n\nThe stock now finds itself up about 30% year to date after the pullback, as of this writing.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see if this decline is an opportunity to buy the stock.\n\nData center in focus\n\nAMD's data center segment has been its biggest growth driver in recent quarters, but revenue rose just 14% in Q2 to $3.2 billion. The slowdown in growth largely stemmed from the company no longer being allowed to sell its MI308 graphics processing units (GPUs) in China during the quarter. This led to a year-over-year revenue decline in its artificial intelligence (AI) business. However, sales are expected to resume in the future once the U.S. government approves its export license to China.\n\nOutside of China, the company said it saw solid progress with its MI300 and MI325 GPUs, with increasing adoption. Seven out of 10 of the top model builders and AI companies now use its GPUs. Meanwhile, AMD claimed with the launch of its MI355 GPU that it matches or exceeds the performance of Nvidia's (NVDA 0.58%) top B200 chip for both training and inference.\n\nAt the same time, AMD's central processing units (CPUs) continue to gain market share in the server space. Growth is also being driven by increasing demand for cloud and on-premises compute, and the investments being made in AI infrastructure.\n\nAMD's client and gaming segment, which provides CPUs for computers and GPUs for gaming devices, saw revenue surge 69% in the quarter to $3.6 billion. The company saw strong CPU share gains during the quarter and was helped by strong sell-through for AMD-powered commercial notebooks. Meanwhile, it saw strong demand for its newly launched gaming GPUs, as well as an uptick in semi-custom chip revenue.\n\nAMD's embedded segment, meanwhile, saw a 4% decline in revenue to $824 million. It expects sequential growth in the second half as demand improves across several key markets.\n\nOverall, the company's revenue climbed by 32% to $7.69 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS), however, plunged 30% to $0.48. Analysts were looking for EPS of $0.49 on sales of $7.42 billion, as compiled by LSEG. Note that its EPS was hurt by its $800 million inventory write-down related to Chinese export controls.\n\nLooking ahead, AMD projected Q3 revenue to grow by 28% to $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The guidance does not include any potential revenue from MI308 shipments to China.\n\nShould investors buy the dip?\n\nThe export restrictions on China impacted AMD's Q2 results, although given the comments from President Donald Trump, this headwind should go away in the future. With shipments to China not currently in Q3 guidance, there could be some upside if the company is allowed to begin shipping its GPUs to the country before quarter end.\n\nExcluding China, which the company previously said would have a negative $700 million impact in Q2, its data center revenue would have grown about 39% by my calculations. That's solid, although a slowdown from Q1.\n\nStill, AMD should have a big opportunity in the future as inference -- where it has a solid niche -- becomes a bigger part of the market. The company is also on track to introduce its M400 chip, which it is looking to compete with Nvidia's next-generation Rubin chip.\n\nTurning to valuation, AMD stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 27.5 times 2026 analyst estimates. That's up significantly from where the stock traded at earlier this year, but if the company can become a meaningful player in the AI inference market, the stock could have a lot of upside in front of it.\n\nAs such, I think investors can dip a toe into the stock on its pullback.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:18:29.978723+00:00"}

It has delivered explosive returns for shareholders this year and is rapidly growing from a business standpoint, too.\n\nThere's nothing to dislike about Palantir's business from an investing standpoint (you may have qualms about what its software is used for in government, but that's beside the point), but there is a lot to dislike about the stock.\n\nAlongside Palantir's rapid rise has been a massive expansion in valuation, and it has become the most expensive stock on the market. I think that this is unsustainable and could lead to some lackluster stock performance over the next few years.\n\nAlthough Palantir has a market cap of over $425 billion, I think ASML (ASML 2.81%) and AMD (AMD 1.52%) could surpass it over the next three years, despite each being worth around $275 billion.\n\nThe case against Palantir\n\nAs mentioned above, Palantir's business is phenomenal. Its software is becoming the building blocks for deploying AI in business and government, and it has the growth to show for it. In the second quarter, Palantir's revenue rose 48% year over year to more than $1 billion. That blew away expectations and showcases the unstoppable demand Palantir is experiencing.\n\nThe problem is that the growth rate is already baked into the stock.\n\nOne of the premier AI stocks over the past few years has been Nvidia. Nvidia posted growth rates of more than 200% during its run, yet never traded for more than 46 times sales or 51 times forward earnings. Palantir has far exceeded those levels despite much slower growth.\n\nLet's break down what growth it would take for Palantir to trade at a reasonable level. If Palantir can sustain a 50% revenue growth rate over the next three years, it would increase its revenue from today's $3.44 billion total to $11.6 billion. If we give Palantir a 30% profit margin (its profit margin was 22% over the past 12 months), that would indicate Palantir would generate $3.5 billion in profits.\n\nAt today's $425 billion market cap, that would still price Palantir's stock at 122 times three-year forward earnings. This showcases how expensive Palantir's stock is, and indicates it could be ripe for a pullback.\n\nAs a result, I think it's possible that ASML and AMD could be larger than Palantir in three years by doing nothing different.\n\nASML and AMD don't have to do anything special to be worth more than Palantir\n\nBoth ASML and AMD are reasonably priced for their current business, and each is expected to put up respectable growth figures over the next few years, although still far slower than Palantir.\n\nUsing Nvidia's max valuation of about 50 times forward earnings as the high point for Palantir's earnings in three years ($3.5 billion), that would indicate the stock should be worth around $175 billion. As mentioned before, Palantir trades at around a $425 billion market cap right now, so this would indicate a substantial drop.\n\nBoth ASML and AMD are valued at around $275 billion, so Palantir's potential drop would cause these two to be worth more.\n\nPalantir is an incredibly overvalued stock, but it has a strong and devoted following, and it may continue to defy traditional valuation metrics, similar to Tesla. Investors are more than capable of holding onto Palantir stock at elevated prices, so the correction to its price may never come, despite all factors indicating that it should.\n\nI still think AMD and ASML will (and should) be valued higher than Palantir's stock, but investors will have to wait and find out if that turns out to be true.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:18:31.535640+00:00"}

Its chips can be found in popular consumer products like Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox, and even the infotainment systems inside Tesla's electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, AMD's biggest opportunity right now is in the data center. The company is planning to launch a new lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI development in 2026, which could blow the competition -- including Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) -- out of the water.\n\nAMD stock is up 34% in 2025 already, but it's still below its all-time high just north of $200, which was set last year. Should investors scoop it up while it's still trading at a discount? Read on to find out.\n\nAMD is catching up to Nvidia in the data center space\n\nAMD launched its flagship MI300X data center GPU at the end of 2023, more than a year after Nvidia's industry-leading H100 GPU hit the market. Despite being behind, AMD still managed to attract some of Nvidia's largest customers, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms.\n\nWhile Nvidia continues to leap ahead of the competition with new GPU architectures like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, AMD is quickly closing the gap. It just started shipping its MI350 series GPUs, which are based on a new architecture the company calls Compute DNA (CDNA) 4. These new chips offer 35 times more performance than CDNA 3 versions like the original MI300X, placing them on par with Nvidia's Blackwell lineup.\n\nIn fact, the latest MI355 offers comparable performance to Nvidia's Blackwell GB200 GPU, and it delivers up to 40% more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) in AI inference workloads for the same cost. In other words, it's much cheaper to run over the long term without sacrificing any processing power, which is why it's attracting hyperscalers and even leading AI start-ups like OpenAI.\n\nBut customers' attention is already turning to 2026, when AMD plans to release its MI400 series. These new chips will be combined with specialized software and hardware systems to create a fully integrated AI data center rack called Helios, which will supercharge their performance. AMD CEO Lisa Su believes these MI400-based Helios systems will be the most powerful in the world when they launch, offering a staggering 10 times more performance over the MI350 series.\n\nSimply put, 2026 could be the year that AMD overtakes Nvidia in the AI data center space, at least in terms of technological capability.\n\nAMD's AI data center revenue hit a speed bump in Q2\n\nAMD generated a record $7.7 billion in total revenue during the second quarter of 2025, which was a 32% increase from the year-ago period. The data center segment was responsible for $3.2 billion of that revenue on its own, but it only mustered 14% growth, which was somewhat disappointing given the competitive, high-stakes nature of the GPU market.\n\nExport restrictions were recently imposed by the U.S. government, and they wiped out AMD's AI GPU sales to China, which was the main reason for the underperformance in its data center segment. However, the company says it has applied for licenses to resume sales, and they are currently under review by the Trump administration.\n\nBut there was great news in other areas of AMD's business, like its client segment, where revenue soared 67% year over year to $2.5 billion. This is where the company accounts for sales of its Ryzen AI chips for personal computers, which come with a built-in GPU, central processing unit (CPU), and neural processing unit (NPU). They are installed in a growing number of computers from leading brands like Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus.\n\nAMD's gaming business also roared back to life in Q2, with revenue surging by 73% to $1.1 billion. Revenue declined in this segment last year, and also during the first quarter of 2025, but demand for some of the company's core products is starting to rebound. Console manufacturers are increasing their inventories in preparation for the holiday season, and AMD said demand for its new Radeon 9000 series desktop GPUs is exceeding supply.\n\nShould you buy AMD stock while it's under $200?\n\nDespite the temporary regulatory headwind in AMD's data center business, Lisa Su is as optimistic as ever about its potential. She believes the company's AI revenue will scale into the tens of billions of dollars per year over the long term, driven by the MI400 GPU, which is already experiencing strong customer interest even though it won't hit the market until next year.\n\nOn that note, is AMD stock a buy while it's still below its record high? The company generated $3.45 in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) over the last four quarters, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46.8. That means it's notably cheaper than Nvidia stock, which is sitting at a P/E ratio of 55.7.\n\nMoreover, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests AMD could deliver $5.97 in EPS during 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 27.1. That leaves room for significant upside, because the stock would have to soar by 73% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 46.8.\n\nIt's possible AMD stock will perform even better if the MI400 series blows the competition out of the water next year, like Su expects, so it could be a great addition to any diversified portfolio right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:18:32.897183+00:00"}

Tom Cotton over his ties with China. In April, a Reuters report detailed Tan's wide-ranging investments in Chinese companies made through his VC firm, Walden International. The outlet found that the firm \"remains invested in 20 funds and companies alongside Chinese government funds or state-owned enterprises, according to Chinese corporate databases.\"\n\nCotton wrote a letter to Intel chairman Frank Yeary on Wednesday, saying he felt \"concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security,\" given those ties.\n\nTan responded in a memo to employees posted on Intel's website late Thursday, saying there was \"a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles.\" He went on to express his love for the United States, where he's lived for more than 40 years.\n\n\"We are engaging with the Administration to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts,\" he wrote. \"I fully share the President's commitment to advancing U.S. national and economic security, I appreciate his leadership to advance these priorities, and I'm proud to lead a company that is so central to these goals.\"\n\nIntel is the only remaining large-scale US-based advanced chip manufacturer and has contracts with the Department of Defense.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock gained 3.1% on the news that its board of directors approved a new multi-billion dollar compensation package for CEO Elon Musk. The package, which included an award of 96 million shares valued at nearly $30 billion, reassured investors by securing Musk’s continued leadership. This move was particularly significant because Musk had previously suggested he might develop products outside of Tesla if his ownership stake was not increased. The board's action came after a court had previously voided a different pay package. The stock's climb also occurred during a broader market upswing that lifted other large technology companies.\n\nTesla is down 12.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $330.92 per share, it is trading 31% below its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,499.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

(GROQ.PVT) CEO Jonathan Ross said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nFor years, Intel's dominance in the chip industry was unquestioned. But the rise of rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has upended the game.\n\nRoss acknowledged that Intel remains important to the country. “The more semiconductor companies we have that can push the bleeding edge, the better off the US is,” he said. \"I do think it's important that Intel be in a strong position.\"\n\nThe chip giant is mired in a prolonged slump, and its new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has come under fire from Trump due to business ties with China.\n\nBut Ross isn't ruling out a turnaround. It'll have to eliminate its bureaucracy — as the company grew, layers of management and internal politics slowed down its innovation, Ross noted.\n\n\"You don't get to [fix] it just by handing money out. You have to fix some of the systemic issues,\" he added.\n\nOn the US semiconductor landscape, Ross said the current tariffs and incentives are a step forward for domestic manufacturers.\n\n\"It's incredibly difficult to build chips in the United States. We're just now building the ecosystem. Even when chips are manufactured in the United States, it's really hard to package them in North America,\" he said.\n\nGroq's in a unique position, as it decided to manufacture in the US since its founding in 2016, shielding it from Trump's threatened 100% tariff on semiconductors.\n\nRoss, who previously designed customer chips at Google (GOOG) to train AI models, founded Groq, which develops Language Processing Units (LPUs). These chips are engineered to run LLMs more efficiently than Nvidia’s GPUs, accelerating the shift from basic reasoning to groundbreaking invention.\n\nIn August 2024, Groq raised $493.5 million, boosting its valuation to an estimated $5.76 billion, according to Yahoo Finance's private companies data tracker.\n\nRoss said large language models are becoming less mistake-prone, expanding the areas in which they can be used.\n\n\"At some point, they'll make so few mistakes you can use it in medicine, you can use it in law,\" Ross previously said on the Opening Bid podcast.\n\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$32.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.06 in 2025. There's been a pretty noticeable increase in sentiment, with the analysts upgrading revenues and making a solid gain to earnings per share in particular.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices\n\nWith these upgrades, we're not surprised to see that the analysts have lifted their price target 18% to US$181per share. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Advanced Micro Devices analyst has a price target of US$230 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$120. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Advanced Micro Devices' growth to accelerate, with the forecast 24% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 20% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 17% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Advanced Micro Devices to grow faster than the wider industry.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:19:02.918393+00:00"}

The president also saying yesterday that they'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors but then saying that if you're building in the US, or planning to build in the US, then maybe you're exempt. How do you make sense of, of that language? What, what are you getting at?\n\n00:37 Speaker B\n\nYeah, it's, it is, it is tough. So like, you know, he made some comments yesterday and that's what we have to go on. Um, you know, this is all part of what's, what was called a 232 investigation, um, in, into semiconductors and, and other things. And we actually haven't seen the report from the 232 investigators. So once we see that, I think we can start to be a little more, you know, prescriptive about what the actual impacts are, will be. Like right now, we're just trying to decipher his comments and, and, look, this is Trump, you know, he makes comments all the time and sometimes they lack detail and, and nuance, right? Um, and so we, we, we don't actually know like what it means. Um, you know, what he did say, you're right, he said there's going to be a hundred percent tariffs on semis, but if you're building here in the US then you'll be exempt. And there's a bunch of stuff in, but there's questions, what does building in the US mean? How much do you have to build? Like what's the timeframe? You know, is it, is it, is he talking about semiconductors? Is he talking about the end devices? Will there be tariffs on just raw semiconductors coming into the US, which is actually not that much? We don't import that much. Or is it tariffs on semiconductors in devices? You know, can customers still use, you know, TSMC manufacturing capacity in Taiwan with no tariff because TSMC is building a lot in the US? Like, I, I don't know. I don't know exactly how to, to parse this yet. Um, we will have to wait until we, we, we see, uh, the actual report. I think though, the reason the stocks are up is it does look like there, there will be some loopholes or some reprieves from this, the blind hundred percent tariffs. And, you know, there are semiconductor companies and other, like tech companies that are investing a lot in the US and trying to build here. And so I think there's a perception, which hopefully it's, at least there's some, some truth to it that, um, there will be some reprieve from this. We, we won't know for sure, we won't be able to really, um, be specific about it until we actually see what is, what is going on, uh, when they actually file the, the regulations.\n\n04:04 Speaker A\n\nAnd, so, I, I know this then makes the, the final question sort of hard to answer, right? But as an investor in the space, is there a winner or loser from sort of what we've just laid out or who's kind of best positioned then given that?\n\n04:25 Speaker B\n\nI mean, like the knee jerk reaction, you, you'll say, look, companies, at least on the semiconductor side, companies that are actually actively building here, presumably would be, you know, perceived as, as relative winners. I mean, you've got companies like Texas Instruments, for example, who are building a significant amount of capacity in the US. That is their plan and they've been delivering on it and, and there's more to come. You have companies like, like Nvidia. Like Nvidia doesn't build chips, like they're, they're fabless, they outsource manufacturing, but they're investing a lot of money in the AI supply chain, at least they're giving headlines so you, you have that. Um, I mean, you've got fabless companies like, like AMD or, or, or Qualcomm or whatever that actually can use in, in, at TSMC in Arizona. And, you know, there is a read of the comments that suggests maybe they could continue to use the Taiwan stuff tariff free, like, we, we don't know yet, but like, maybe. Um, you've got the semi caps. Like again, if we have to build more capacity here in the US at the margin, that's probably incrementally positive for the US semi cap players. Um, so those are the kinds of like knee jerk reactions that I mean in some sense are probably going on today. Um, and again, we'll know more like when we get more specifics.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:19:04.839235+00:00"}

But moves this big are rare even for Eli Lilly and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 9 days ago when the stock dropped 4.3% on the news that its key competitor in the weight-loss drug market, Novo Nordisk, lowered its sales and profit growth forecasts for 2025. The lowered guidance from the Danish pharmaceutical giant cast a shadow over the high-growth weight-loss drug sector. This was the second time this year Novo Nordisk had reduced its outlook, which amplified investor concerns about the market's future performance. Compounding the issue, Eli Lilly also faced headwinds as CVS Caremark implemented coverage restrictions on its popular weight-loss drug, Zepbound, in response to surging demand. The combination of a major competitor's weakened forecast and specific access challenges for one of Lilly's key products appeared to prompt the sell-off.\n\nEli Lilly is down 17.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $643.46 per share, it is trading 33% below its 52-week high of $960.02 from August 2024.

Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 2%, while Micron (MU) stocks edged up 0.7%.\n\nMost of the world's advanced chips are produced by leading contract chip manufacturer TSMC (TSM) in Taiwan, but the company has been building out its capacity in Arizona with a $165 billion investment, exempting it from Trump's tariffs. The company's US-listed shares jumped nearly 5% Thursday.\n\nTech companies have rushed to announce investments in their US manufacturing footprint in the hopes of avoiding Trump’s trade war wrath. So far, Nvidia has committed to producing $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the US. Micron made a similar $200 billion commitment. Texas Instruments (TXN) has said it’s spending $60 billion to bolster its manufacturing capacity in the US.\n\nCiti analyst Christopher Danely said the exemptions mean the semiconductor tariff will have “minimal impact … as US-based semiconductor companies with in-house fabs have operations in the US and fabless companies can commit to using TSMC, Samsung, GFS which have operations in the US.”\n\n“Fabs” refer to factories where chips are produced, and “fabless” companies outsource production of their chips to contract manufacturers such as TSMC, Samsung (005930.KS), and GFS (GFS). Companies with in-house fabs include Intel (INTC), Micron, and Texas Instruments. Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Qualcomm (QCOM) are fabless.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) analyst Joseph Moore echoed Danely's sentiment, writing in a note to clients Thursday, “To some degree this outcome would be something of a relief.”\n\n“Yes, 100% tariffs are unpalatable but if companies are given time to restore them, the real tax is just the higher cost of building chips in the United States,\" he wrote. \"The biggest fear was that such a tariff would be implemented immediately.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:19:21.671867+00:00"}

The co-founder, CEO, and chief investment officer of Ark Invest is at her best when growth stocks are rallying, and that's the case right now. Her largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) is up 42% over the past three months and a whopping 79% over the past year.\n\nArk bought shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%), Toast (TOST 1.97%), and Ibotta (IBTA 3.70%) on Wednesday, expanding her existing stakes.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nWhen Ark was adding to its AMD position on Monday, it was easy to connect the dots. The maker of GPUs and microprocessors was reporting its second-quarter results on Tuesday afternoon. Wood was betting on a positive market reaction to the report, buying ahead for a little extra kick. The financial update didn't play out that way. AMD stock took a 6% hit on Wednesday. Wood was wrong. She was early. Hoping to make the best of a bad situation, Ark was buying even more AMD shares at a lower price point during the midweek sell-off. AMD's second quarter was mixed. Revenue rose 32% to a record $7.7 billion. It was the first quarter of decelerating top-line growth after four periods of acceleration, but it was well ahead of the 27% growth that Wall Street pros were modeling. It was a beat, but the victory lap didn't make it all the way down to the other end of the income statement.\n\nAMD's adjusted profit of $0.48 a share -- a 30% year-over-year decline -- was merely in line with analyst estimates. After a long run of quarterly beats, AMD proved mortal on the bottom line. A leadership baton was handed over during the quarter. Over the past year, it's been AMD's data center segment that has been shouldering the burden of growth. This time the segment only rose 14% to $3.2 billion, sliding to account for less than 42% of the revenue mix. It was a 69% top-line jump for its client and gaming segment doing the heavy lifting this time. Guidance calls for revenue to climb 28% for the current quarter, and that doesn't include the potential upside if trade restrictions with China ease so it can ship its Instinct MI308 GPUs. Analysts didn't seem to mind the sell-off. At least a dozen of them boosted their price targets following its quarterly results. They might just be catching up to the last few months of upticks, but it's a good thing to see on a day when the stock is going the other way.\n\n2. Toast\n\nAnother stock that was eighty-sixed by the market on Wednesday despite a solid quarter was Toast. The growing provider of point-of-sale platforms for restaurant operators was initially trading as high as 7% after announcing its numbers after the market close on Tuesday. Toast would go on to lose 4% of its value by the end of trading on Wednesday, a cruel 11% reversal in the span of less than 24 hours.\n\nToast is still finding new eateries flocking to its sticky enterprise solution that does so much more than just cash customers out at the end of a meal with its portable devices. Toast closed out the quarter serving 148,000 locations, 24% more than it was assisting a year ago. Gross payment volume rose 23%, and that increase is slightly less than the restaurant count on its platform. This could be a minor pressure point for the industry if folks are spending less at restaurants. It could also be a sign that Toast is growing by reaching out to smaller eateries, but that's hard to believe with Toast starting to score deals with larger chains of high-volume concepts.\n\nRevenue rose 25% -- and its annualized recurring run rate grew 31% -- but that's a testament to its ability to expand its business and improve its product beyond merely a payment platform. Its net income soared fivefold. Toast is doing just fine as a business. Even after Wednesday's hit, the shares are up 35% so far this year.\n\n3. Ibotta\n\nIbotta was the only stock of the three to move higher on Wednesday, but it was also a case of Wood shopping for bargains. The company behind a digital marketing app that rewards users with cash-back rewards for making in-store or online purchases through ad-sponsored deals is down a blistering 44% this year.\n\nIt doesn't report until next week, and expectations are low compared to AMD and Toast. Ibotta was growing quickly at the time of its initial public offering (IPO) last year, having seen its top line shoot 52% higher for all of 2023. Revenue would go on to decelerate to 15% last year, and it continues to tap the brakes. Ibotta's guidance for when it reports second-quarter results next week calls for a 2% increase in revenue on a double-digit decline in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nAnalysts see a return to double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the second half of this year and through 2026, so its guidance next week is crucial for paying off for Wood's purchase this week. Ibotta is transitioning from a direct-to-consumer model to a third-party approach. It's bringing more users to the platform, but they are less engaged than its original lucrative audience. Delivering on ambitious analyst expectations can get Ibotta's stock chart moving in the right direction.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:19:23.059803+00:00"}

On the earnings call, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that the company isn't including any revenue from its MI308 chips in guidance, as U.S. export licenses are still under review. That left Wall Street guessing on how much, if any, upside could come from the recent easing of restrictions. China remains a critical market for AMD and its rival Nvidia (NVDA), and the policy shift had raised hopes of a revenue rebound. But Su kept it cautious: We are not including any MI308 revenue in our third-quarter guidance, she said. Analysts pushed hard for specifics. They didn't get them.\n\nWhat they did get, though, was a reiteration of AMD's longer-term AI ambitions. Su sees a clear path to scaling its AI business into the tens of billions, and flagged the company's upcoming MI350 lineup as a key lever. Still, investors looking for firm numbers or timelines walked away empty-handed. CFO Jean Hu added that previously written-down inventory in China won't convert to revenue quicklyit includes incomplete chips that need more work. Translation: even with a green light from regulators, meaningful China AI revenue could take time to show up in the numbers.\n\nAnd yetAMD's core business is delivering. Q2 sales rose 32% to $7.7 billion, topping estimates, with data center revenue up 14% and PC-related revenue jumping 67%. Its Q3 revenue forecast of $8.7 billion also came in above the Street's $8.37 billion estimate. AMD is still the best-performing stock in the semiconductor space this year, up 44%. But the China overhangand Nvidia's dominance in AI acceleratorsmeans the road ahead won't be easy. AMD may be on a strong trajectory, but the market is watching closely for proof it can translate ambition into AI market share.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:19:29.661263+00:00"}

This six-week period, where many of Wall Street's most influential businesses lift the hood on their operating results, provides investors with invaluable information.\n\nHowever, an equally strong argument can be made that the quarterly filing of Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission is just as important as earnings season. A 13F offers investors a way to see which stocks Wall Street's top money managers have been buying and selling. In other words, these filings clue investors in to the stocks, industries, sectors, and trends that have piqued the interest of highly successful asset managers.\n\nArguably no trend has been hotter than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Empowering software and systems with the tools to make split-second decisions without human intervention is a multitrillion-dollar global opportunity, which explains why AI stocks have soared.\n\nBut not all of Wall Street's prominent billionaire fund managers are along for the ride.\n\nBased on 13Fs filed in mid-May that detail first-quarter trading activity, Appaloosa's billionaire chief David Tepper has been a big-time seller of three red-hot AI stocks -- Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), or TSMC -- over the previous year. Curiously, though, Tepper has been loading up on another AI stock that somewhat recently joined the exclusive trillion-dollar club.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper has been a persistent seller of Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC stock\n\nTepper and his team tend to be fairly active and are regularly building up or reducing their existing stakes. Rather than looking at changes from the prior three-month period, more wisdom can often be gained by examining year-over-year changes to Appaloosa's more than $8 billion dollar investment portfolio.\n\nBetween April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025, Tepper oversaw a significant reduction in, or the complete exit from, three of the AI revolution's top companies:\n\nNvidia : 4,120,000 shares sold (93% reduction), which has been adjusted to account for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024.\n\n: 4,120,000 shares sold (93% reduction), which has been adjusted to account for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor : 230,000 shares sold (46% reduction).\n\n: 230,000 shares sold (46% reduction). Advanced Micro Devices: 1,630,000 shares sold (completely exited position).\n\nAll three of these companies have been successful in their own right within the AI arena. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the bulk of GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers, while AMD's Instinct series chips are slowly adding market share. Meanwhile, TSMC is the world's leading chip-fabrication company, with its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity rapidly expanding to satiate growing enterprise demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nIf everything is going to well for Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC, the question that has to be asked is: Why did billionaire David Tepper sell over a 12-month period?\n\nSimple profit-taking is one of the more logical answers. All three companies have seen their shares appreciate noticeably over the trailing-three-year period, and Tepper has demonstrated he's not shy about locking in gains. What's worrisome is there may be more to this persistent selling activity than just a desire to take some chips off the table.\n\nFor example, every next-big-thing technology since (and including) the proliferation of the internet in the mid-1990s has navigated its way through a bubble that eventually burst. In plainer English, investors continually overestimate the adoption rates and/or utility of game-changing technological advances. It's going to take time for AI to mature as a technology and for businesses to figure out how to optimize their solutions and generate a positive return on their investments. This suggests another bubble may be brewing.\n\nWhereas Taiwan Semiconductor is a diversified company that generates a meaningful percentage of its net sales from fabricating chips for smartphones, Internet of Things, and automotive, Nvidia and AMD are increasingly reliant on enterprise GPU orders. If an AI bubble were to form and burst, these two companies would be hit hard.\n\nValuation may have also come into play for Appaloosa's billionaire chief. Historically, industry-leading businesses thriving on the heels of a next-big-thing trend have topped out at 30 to 40 times trailing-12-month sales. Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 31, as of this writing.\n\nWith the stock market also historically pricey, Tepper may view Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC as being on shakier ground than their respective share prices would indicate.\n\nThis trillion-dollar AI stock is bucking the trend in Tepper's fund\n\nWhereas billionaire David Tepper has been an undeniable seller of artificial intelligence stocks over the trailing year, based on 13F filings, there's one trillion-dollar AI stock that's managed to buck the trend. During the March-ended quarter, Appaloosa gobbled up 130,000 shares of Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), which is one of only 11 public companies around the world to have ever reached a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nWhile Nvidia and AMD have locked down the lion's share of GPU market share in AI-accelerated data centers, Broadcom is the preferred choice for its host of AI networking solutions. Its products are capable of connecting tens of thousands of AI-GPUs in order to maximize compute capacity, as well as minimize tail latency. Put simply, Broadcom's hardware reduces lag, which facilitates the split-second decisions that need to be made by AI-empowered software and systems.\n\nBroadcom is also making a name for itself thanks to its custom AI chips. During the company's fourth-quarter conference call in late 2024, CEO Hock Tan opined that a few of its hyperscaler clients could spend anywhere from $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 (its fiscal year ends in late October or early November). As long as AI remains a hot trend, Broadcom is expected to be one of the more unstoppable stocks.\n\nBut what Appaloosa's Tepper might appreciate most about Broadcom is that it's much more than just an AI-driven company. While AI is, unquestionably, Broadcom's most meaningful growth driver at the moment, it has plenty of other channels that generate sales and positive operating cash flow.\n\nBefore AI became the hottest thing on Wall Street, Broadcom was known for its lead role in developing wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Even though smartphones aren't the growth story they were a decade ago, the ongoing expansion of 5G service globally provides a modest growth opportunity for Broadcom.\n\nIn addition, it offers an assortment of solutions for industrial product lines and automobiles, as well as owns an enterprise cybersecurity solutions division. The point being that if the AI bubble were to burst, Broadcom would, in all likelihood, be in better shape to navigate the coming storm than hardware giants Nvidia and AMD.\n\nLastly, Tepper may have found Broadcom's valuation more palatable than the likes of Nvidia. As of this writing on Aug. 5, Broadcom is valued at 35 times forward-year earnings, but appears to be sporting a sustainable annual growth rate of 20% or greater.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:19:41.019586+00:00"}

US futures rose while Asian tech stocks turned in a mixed performance. An exemption amounts to a major victory for Apple and Cook, who were bracing for substantial tariffs.\n\n“We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors, but the good news for companies like Apple is, if you’re building in the United States, or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge,” Trump told reporters.\n\nOn Thursday, Taiwan’s National Development Council Minister Liu Chin-ching said TSMC is exempted from the 100% US chips tariffs although some local companies will be affected. South Korean Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo told local broadcaster SBS that neither Samsung Electronics Co. nor SK Hynix Inc. chips would incur those levies. Both South Korean chip firms have pledged investments in the US.\n\nTrump’s surprise declaration further upends a global electronics supply chain undergoing a seismic shift following decades of reliance on China. Apple joined a parade of companies from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to Nvidia Corp. that have pledged to spend more than $1 trillion collectively since Trump’s ascension, seeking to assuage an administration keen to bring manufacturing back home. While much of the capital in those pledges represented prior commitments or longer-term plans, they appear to be working.\n\nThe US president announced his intentions from the Oval Office flanked by Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who unveiled plans to invest another $100 billion into domestic manufacturing. Any company that demonstrates a similar commitment would be exempt from tariffs on chips — though the White House will levy a separate tax on imports of electronics products from smartphones to cars that employ semiconductors.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump declared plans for a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports while promising to exempt companies such as Apple Inc. that move production back to the US, triggering a scramble among trading partners and companies worldwide to make sense of the threat.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSentiment has been “boosted by Apple’s $100 billion US manufacturing commitment and relief that Trump’s 100% chip tariff is unlikely to disrupt major supply chains,” said Billy Leung, a Sydney-based investment strategist at Global X ETFs. “TSMC’s alignment with US buildout plans, plus underpositioning in Apple, have helped support this bounce.”\n\nBut the bigger question may be Trump’s intentions when it comes to electronics, given the US is the world’s biggest market for consumer technology. The president has said he could unveil separate levies on all products containing semiconductor chips as soon as next week — in theory, that encompasses most everything from cars and appliances to clock radios.\n\nApple’s additional $100 billion US investment will include a new manufacturing program designed to bring more of Apple’s production to the US. Partners include glassmaker Corning Inc., Applied Materials Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.\n\nCorning will dedicate an entire factory in Kentucky to Apple glass production, increasing that company’s workforce in the state by 50%, the iPhone maker said. Corning was already a supplier to Apple, making glass for the very first iPhone at the same factory.\n\nApple had previously pledged to spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years, a slight acceleration over its prior investments and previously announced plans, adding about $39 billion in spending and an additional 1,000 jobs annually. The announcement will bring Apple’s cumulative commitment to $600 billion.\n\nThe previously planned $500 billion is said to include work on a new server manufacturing facility in Houston, a supplier academy in Michigan and additional spending with its existing suppliers in the country.\n\nUncertain Impact\n\nImplementation of Trump’s decision on tariffs — which he said he had not informed Cook of before the event — could have a massive impact on the tech industry.\n\nMany so-called chipmakers don’t actually own factories, preferring to outsource that function mainly to TSMC and, to a lesser extent, Samsung. Apple announced Wednesday that Samsung’s plant in Austin, Texas will supply chips to Apple as part of the new manufacturing program.\n\nWhile companies such as Nvidia — whose CEO met Wednesday with Trump — and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have touted their commitment to sourcing chips from TSMC’s new plants near Phoenix, there still isn’t enough advanced production outside of East Asia, let alone in the US, to meet their needs.\n\nNvidia, like Apple, has committed to spending large sums in the US and localizing procurement. But the company is still part of a complex supply chain that spans the globe and can’t easily be uprooted and replicated in the US.\n\nThe increased pledge comes as Trump escalates a tariff push that’s set to raise costs for Apple throughout its international supply chains.\n\nTrump plans to whack India — a key production market for Apple — with 50% tariffs, the first half of which takes effect just after midnight alongside a raft of other country-specific levies designed to reduce trade imbalances. The other half, to penalize India for buying Russian energy, will take effect later this month.\n\nCook, who attended the president’s inauguration and donated to his inaugural committee, has pushed for tariff exemptions for his company’s iPhones. Most iPhones sold in the US come from India, while the bulk of other products, including Apple Watches, iPads and MacBooks, are manufactured in Vietnam, which was hit with a 20% tariff.\n\nWhile details of those tariffs — and how firms would qualify for exemptions — have yet to be released, Trump singled out Cook’s Apple as an example of how to avoid the increased levies.\n\nApple’s promised investments, while substantial, fall short of the full shift to US-based production that Trump and top White House officials have envisioned and encouraged. Earlier this year, the president threatened to impose a tariff of at least 25% on Apple if it didn’t move manufacturing of the iPhone to the US, a day after he met with Cook at the White House.\n\nCook told the president that final iPhone assembly “will be elsewhere for a while,” though highlighted that several components are being made in the US.\n\nTrump, seemingly satisfied, praised the Apple leader’s plans.\n\n“Look, he’s not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world, not even close,” Trump said of Cook. “He’s coming back. I mean, Apple’s coming back to America.”\n\n--With assistance from Mayumi Negishi, Yian Lee, Miaojung Lin, Yoolim Lee, Edwin Chan, Debby Wu, Jennifer A.

Analysts polled by FactSet had expected AMD to earn 48 cents a share on sales of $7.41 billion. On a year-over-year basis, AMD earnings declined 30% while sales increased 32%.\n\nAMD's second-quarter results were negatively impacted by the U.S. government's export control restrictions. Those rules kept AMD from selling its Instinct MI308 data center processors to China. The restrictions led to about $800 million in inventory and related charges in Q2.\n\nFor the current quarter, AMD predicted sales of $8.7 billion. Wall Street was modeling $8.32 billion for the third quarter.

Analysts said investors likely wanted to see a stronger performance from the data center business.\n\nAMD's PC chip revenue surged 67% to $2.5 billion, driven by strong demand for its latest \"Zen 5\" Ryzen desktop processors.\n\nGaming chip revenue jumped 73% to $1.1 billion, fueled by sales of AMD Radeon graphics processors and custom chips for consoles.\n\nElsewhere on Tuesday, Arteris (AIP) stock jumped after the chip design and technology firm scored a contract from AMD. Arteris announced late Monday that AMD has licensed Arteris' FlexGen network-on-chip interconnect intellectual property for AMD's next generation of AI chiplet designs.\n\nArteris stock rose 37.6% to close at 13 on Tuesday.

After all, that’s where the chip giant realizes revenue on the sale of its high-powered AI processors.\n\nBut the Data Center segment includes more than just chip sales. It also accounts for some of Nvidia’s most important, though often overlooked, offerings: its networking technologies.\n\nComposed of its NVLink, InfiniBand, and Ethernet solutions, Nvidia’s networking products are what allow its chips to communicate with each other, let servers talk to each other inside massive data centers, and ultimately ensure end users can connect to it all to run AI applications.\n\n“The most important part in building a supercomputer is the infrastructure. The most important part is how you connect those computing engines together to form that larger unit of computing,” explained Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of networking at Nvidia.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang attends the 9th edition of the VivaTech trade show at the Parc des Expositions de la Porte de Versailles on June 11, 2025, in Paris. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) · Chesnot via Getty Images\n\nThat also translates into some big sales. Nvidia’s networking sales accounted for $12.9 billion of its $115.1 billion in data center revenue in its prior fiscal year. That might not seem impressive when you consider that chip sales brought in $102.1 billion, but it eclipses the $11.3 billion that Nvidia’s second-largest segment, Gaming, took in for the year.\n\nIn Q1, networking made up $4.9 billion of Nvidia’s $39.1 billion in data center revenue. And it’ll continue to grow as customers continue to build out their AI capacity, whether that’s at research universities or massive data centers.\n\n“It is the most underappreciated part of Nvidia's business, by orders of magnitude,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “Basically, networking doesn't get the attention because it's 11% of revenue. But it's growing like a rocket ship.”\n\nConnecting thousands of chips\n\nWhen it comes to the AI explosion, Nvidia senior vice president of networking Kevin Deierling says the company has to work across three different types of networks. The first is its NVLink technology, which connects GPUs to each other within a server or multiple servers inside of a tall, cabinet-like server rack, allowing them to communicate and boost overall performance.\n\nThen there’s InfiniBand, which connects multiple server nodes across data centers to form what is essentially a massive AI computer. Then there’s the front-end network for storage and system management, which uses Ethernet connectivity.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang presents a Grace Blackwell NVLink72 as he delivers a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025.

The semiconductor company posted a 32% year-over-year revenue jump to a record $7.7 billion. However, AMD also revealed an $800 million hit due to restrictions on its MI308 chip shipments to China. This charge pressured the company's profitability and caused its adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 to miss analyst expectations. The export curbs also squeezed the company's gross margin, which narrowed significantly from the previous year. Investors reacted negatively to the earnings miss and margin pressure, despite the strong sales figures.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nAMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 20 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock dropped 3.2% on the news that the U.S. jobs report for July came in significantly weaker than expected while new widespread import tariffs were announced, sparking fears of a potential economic slowdown. The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs, far below estimates, and massive downward revisions to the prior two months painted a much weaker picture of the labor market. This has stoked recession fears, which would directly impact demand for chips used in countless products. Compounding these worries, the White House announced new tariffs, including a 20% levy on imports from Taiwan, a global hub for chip manufacturing.

Still, shares of the Nvidia competitor were down nearly 7% in recent trading.\n\nAbove-consensus revenue was driven by strength in AMD’s gaming segment, while earnings, margins, and data center sales were negatively impacted by an $800 million charge related to restrictions on the sale of AI chips to China. The company projected growth at all of its units in the third quarter, and forecast double-digit revenue growth as it ramps sales of its MI355X next-gen AI chip.\n\nMost analysts attributed the market's reaction on Wednesday to high expectations and a lofty valuation. “We believe guidance for the AI chip business was in line with Buyside expectations (based on our investor discussions), which is why the stock traded lower,\" according to Citigroup analysts.\n\nBank of America analysts predicted Wall Street was reacting negatively to \"likely ignorable earnings noise\" and that the stock wasn't helped by its approximately 80% run-up in the three months leading up to Tuesday's results.\n\n\n\nPotential Upside From China Sales?\n\nOne big unknown still hanging over AMD is how much revenue the company will generate when it resumes sales of its MI308 chip to China. (The MI308 was designed expressly for Chinese customers to satisfy Biden-era restrictions.) AMD and Nvidia last month said the Commerce Department had agreed to restart reviewing their export license applications after abruptly halting them earlier in the year. Nonetheless, AMD excluded MI308 sales from its guidance on Tuesday.\n\n“There are no China GPU licenses yet, which didn't hurt the outlook but possibly is a letdown for those modeling a $500mn quarterly China contribution in Q3/Q4,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Wednesday.\n\nBut BofA saw reason for optimism in the outlook. “AMD now expects ~$1.7bn in Q3 GPU sales even without ~$800mn of lost China revenue, suggesting overall ~$500mn higher outlook excluding China vs. $2.0bn pre-ban consensus.”\n\nWedbush analysts echoed that bullish view. “The Q3 outlook was better than expected on substantial Q/Q DC GPU growth expectations, even without assuming any MI308 export licenses are granted,” they wrote. “In turn, we believe this guide sets up AMD to exceed our prior outlook for the out quarters.”\n\nPrice Targets Raised; Ratings Remained Mixed\n\nAnalysts at Wedbush raised their AMD stock price target to $190 from $170 on Wednesday. The firm maintained its “outperform” rating on the stock. Citigroup lifted its price target to $180 from $165 but stood by its “neutral” rating, citing elevated expectations.\n\nSeven of the 11 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current AMD ratings and price targets rate the stock a “buy,” with the remainder assigning it a neutral rating. The average price target of $183 implied about 5% upside from Tuesday’s closing price. AMD shares were trading at about $161 midday Wednesday.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:20:07.974272+00:00"}

While no ban was issued, analysts say it's less about H20 and more about messaging. Beijing is signaling that it won't accept hardware backdoors and it's using Nvidia to make that point. Nvidia responded swiftly: No back doors. No spyware. No kill switches. At the same time, US officials confirmed they're exploring software and hardware solutions for chip traceability, though they haven't had direct talks with Nvidia or AMD yet.\n\nBehind the scenes, the stakes are mounting. Washington wants tighter export control enforcement, while Beijing wants leverage and H20 chips offer both sides a bargaining chip. US lawmakers remain split: some want to tighten restrictions, others see room for compromise. Trump's team says a broader deal with China is very close, with rare-earth access already on the table. Still, Chinese state media called the H20 castrated, implying the US reversed course not to appease Beijing, but because China's domestic AI chipmakers are catching up.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese chip stocks like SMIC and Cambricon popped after the Nvidia news, as investors bet on accelerated local substitution. Analysts believe China could now use Nvidia as a pressure valve to demand more supply assurances, or to speed up its push for tech self-sufficiency. Whether the US presses ahead with the Chip Security Act remains to be seen.

That's the one that goes into China because the licenses are still under review. And this coming after Nvidia said last month that the US would be granting licenses to ship AI chips to China. Uh my panelists Dan Hally, Kimberly Forest still with me. Um Dan, when you looked through the earnings, you know, and you sort of were figuring out what your takeaways were, does the China stuff sort of overshadow what seemed like a good quarter?\n\n00:42 Dan Hally\n\nYeah, I mean, that's really kind of what hurt, uh, the the operating income, right? why they saw that operating loss, uh, for the quarter. I think one of the other issues, um, just being that the PC side, the gaming side seem to do rather well, uh, while the AI side, the data center side just kind of met expectations. So I think, you know, when it comes to a company like AMD, a lot of investors want it to be the the next Nvidia, uh, and it just doesn't appear to be doing that at this moment. But they do have their MI 355, uh, MI 350, uh, those are coming. Those are to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, uh, and then obviously we have the MI 400s coming. Uh, those would also compete, uh, with Nvidia's higher end chips, the the VR Rubin, uh, in the future. Uh, and so I think that's really kind of the the biggest issue here is, um, we were, I was reading some of Bernstein's notes this morning, uh, basically saying that, look, the the outlook for data center doesn't really impress the street when, you know, they're anticipating the the kind of explosive growth that they saw out of Nvidia. But you know, Nvidia is the the leader in this space. AMD is trying to to catch up. Uh, they also, while doing that, have to convince customers that they should buy their chips, not just Nvidia's.\n\n02:54 Speaker A\n\nRight, definitely. So that's sort of the underlying story here. And this brings me back to a comment I read this morning came from Jordan Klein over at Mizuho, who tracks the tech stocks. And he said, who really owns owns AMD or Nvidia just due to upside from sales back into China that had been blocked by Trump. He's but basically he's saying that's not really the story here. Um, so is that how you feel about AMD too? And sort of how much ramp do they have room do they have in that data center business?\n\n03:37 Kimberly Forest\n\nSure. Well, I think that they have a lot of room. And yeah, it would be nice for them to be able to sell, um, chips today. But if you're owning a stock and we own them for three to five years. So we have a longer term view. Our view is that AMD is the closest, um, thing to be able to compete against that Blackwell chip. Now, they have a couple of really important hurdles to get over. The first is just basic data center hygiene. Um, data center managers like to have everything uniform and the same because things are always breaking. They have to be able to understand, you know, the parameters of the chip. What does it look like when it's going to break? How can we whip that, um, board out, slide a new one in and get on with our jobs. So that is the first hurdle. The second hurdle is Nvidia's name brand. I, in my note that I wrote earlier today, this really to me feels like the.com era where any kind of goofy idea could get funded as a.com if they had two things. If they specified Oracle as their database and Sun Microsystems was the servers that they were going to run on it, because that tech stack looked like you knew what you were doing.

The semiconductor specialist's share price was down 9.2% at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nAMD published its second-quarter results after the market closed yesterday and reported earnings that were in line with Wall Street's targets and sales that beat expectations. While the company issued encouraging forward sales guidance, growth for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) graphics processing units (GPUs) slowed and was weaker than anticipated.\n\nAMD stock is seeing big post-earnings sell-offs\n\nWith its Q2 report, AMD posted non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.48 on revenue of $7.69 billion. Earnings for the period matched the average Wall Street analyst estimate, and sales for the period came in $260 million better than called for by the forecast. While sales were up 31.7% year over year, investors are having a problem with the revenue composition for the period.\n\nSales for AMD's central processing units (CPUs) for PCs and servers and GPUs for gaming accounted for a bigger share of revenue than the market expected. Meanwhile, stronger growth for the company's AI data center GPUs has been central to valuation gains for the stock over the last few months. Investors are selling out of the stock today in response to AI GPU sales missing the mark.\n\nWhat's next for AMD?\n\nAMD is guiding for third-quarter sales to come in between $8.4 billion and $9 billion -- significantly ahead of the average analyst estimate's call for revenue of $8.32 billion in the period. Hitting the midpoint of management's guidance range would mean delivering year-over-year sales growth of roughly 28%.\n\nAMD's Q2 results and guidance for the current quarter were far from bad, but it seems sales on lower-margin CPUs are accounting for a larger-than-expected share of the company's growth. While the miss on AI GPU sales is disappointing, the stock deserves a closer look from growth investors with a long-term outlook after today's pullback.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:20:28.679418+00:00"}

We know that earnings have outperformed expectations every single quarter since Q4 of 2023, but earnings this quarter declined based upon that ban of the company to sell their chips to, or rather, ban from chips from China. Now, what we know is that in this battle, in this arms race of the AI revolution, so to say, we know that AMD continues to trail behind that, you know, Godfather of AI, Jensen Wong's Nvidia, as Dan Ives likes to put it. And that's what we saw again. We saw AMD's data centers bring in revenue of up 14% to $3.2 billion. Now, that Trump, or rather Nvidia trumps that in comparison, when you think about what they posted in Q1, their data segment jumped 73% to more than 39 billion. Of course, Nvidia is set to come out later on this month. But the hopes were high, the intentions were high, and now all questions remain about that Q3 guidance and what this could look like when we are able to return to shipments of these AI chips from China.\n\n02:01 Speaker B\n\nYeah, and there's also the question of, aside from the China discussion, about what was already priced in the shares. I gotta say I'm just laughing to myself reading a note from Jordan Klein over at Mizuho, so the is the, um, sector specialist on tech. And he said, who really owns AMD or Nvidia just due to upside from sales back into China that have been blocked by Trump? If you do, shame on you, he says, because people are really focused more on the bigger AI story here. But all of that said, Josh, if you look at the, what AMD has done this year, let alone from the lows, you see maybe why things are pulling back a little today.\n\n03:06 Josh Lipton\n\nWell, Julie, to add to that point, who owns an AI stock for them to not beat on earnings per share, right? In the previous quarter. When you look at why a lot of these AI tech stocks rally, it's because in the prior quarter earnings almost always beat estimates, right? When you look at what the hyper scalars were able to do last week, when you look at what Nvidia does every quarter, an earnings surprise is essentially expected, and that is not what AMD did. And then, yes, when you zoom out over the year, it has been the best performing semiconductor of the year. The stock is up over 40% this year, and you compare it to an Nvidia and a Broadcom. This year, it has actually outperformed, as you're seeing on your screen now, but you zoom out over the last five years, and AMD has not even come close to the performance that you see on your screen there in blue and yellow from Nvidia and Broadcom, right? So you've seen a little bit of a catch-up rally for AMD as people wonder where they're going to fit into this AI story, but largely they have not been near the forefront of it, of course, and they've sort of been chasing. But I think from a quarter, this quarter specific stock story, it's interesting to think about AMD's rally off the lows and to see this stock reaction when we think ahead to what's coming from Nvidia at the end of the month. So Bank of America's Vivek Arya, the analyst that covers Nvidia, he covers AMD, he had pointed out in his Nvidia preview note, which I know you were talking about the other day, Julie, highlighting that given that Nvidia has rallied so significantly since that April low, the ability to impress the market for some of these AI chip makers might be challenging this quarter. You're certainly seeing that with AMD, and it makes you wonder about the big one we're going to get at the end of the month, too.\n\n05:19 Speaker B\n\nYes, it does indeed.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:20:34.899218+00:00"}

As of this writing, leaders like Palantir Technologies and Advanced Micro Devices advanced 148% and 44% year to date, respectively.\n\nSo, with so much optimism surrounding this emerging technology, what other AI stocks should be on the radar of tech-focused investors? Here are two of my favorites.\n\nSoundHound AI\n\nFirst, there's SoundHound AI (SOUN 0.60%). SoundHound is a leading provider of voice AI and agentic AI systems. The company's products help people interact with AI-powered tools, and they are often used in automotive or customer service settings.\n\nAs the AI revolution rolls on, communication between humans and AI systems will become increasingly important, and it will be crucial for organizations to make this communication as fast and easy as possible, both for the purposes of customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.\n\nAnd while I view SoundHound as a years-long investment due to its status as a young company with a long growth horizon ahead of it, there are promising signs that SoundHound is already executing at a high level.\n\nFor example, last week the company announced stellar results for the second quarter (the three months ending on June 30, 2025), highlighted by far better-than-expected revenue growth.\n\nIn addition to its soaring sales figures, the company announced a narrower-than-expected loss for the quarter and a robust pipeline of pending orders across a wide variety of industries, including healthcare, financial services, retail, restaurants, and automotive.\n\nSoundHound is a stock to watch, especially for investors who are seeking an AI stock that will take many years to reach its full potential. As with any stock, particularly in the AI sector, there are risks. SoundHound remains unprofitable, and competition within the AI sector is robust and fast-changing. Nevertheless, growth-oriented investors should consider SoundHound stock.\n\nNvidia\n\nThen, there's Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%). It may seem hard to believe, but Nvidia might not be getting enough credit within the AI investment community right now.\n\nObviously, there's plenty of focus on stocks like Palantir, which have registered massive triple-digit returns year to date, but Nvidia's 36% return is nothing to sneeze at. What's all the more impressive is that Nvidia has achieved that return while its market cap has skyrocketed.\n\nAs of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $4.4 trillion, the highest of any company. Moreover, its market cap now exceeds its closest rival -- Microsoft -- by some $600 billion.\n\nAt any rate, Nvidia remains the king of AI for one very simple -- and very good -- reason: It is the top dog when it comes to AI chips. The company's cutting-edge graphics processing units remain the most desirable hardware within the AI ecosystem, powering massive supercomputers and data centers that are the computing muscle behind the large language models and AI-powered tools that are taking the world by storm.\n\nLooking past the secular AI tailwinds that are powering Nvidia, it's clear the company is taking advantage of its strategic position and deploying capital smartly and efficiently. Gross and operating margins have moved in tandem, with both figures now well above 50%. Similarly, thanks to the company's massive $50 billion stock buyback program, the number of outstanding Nvidia shares has decreased by about 2% over the last three years, despite generous stock-based compensation awards to employees.\n\nNvidia has already rewarded investors with massive returns in recent years. However, the company's products remain integral to the overall AI ecosystem, which continues to grow rapidly. While there are risks to owning Nvidia stock, including potential AI spending deceleration or trade risks, I believe these concerns are outweighed in the long term. Investors should consider Nvidia stock now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:56:05.156277+00:00"}

It's always a bit noteworthy when a company is paid by the tax man, rather than paying the tax man. We're sure the company was pleased with its tax benefit. However, our data indicates that tax benefits can temporarily boost statutory profit in the year it is booked, but subsequently profit may fall back. In the likely event the tax benefit is not repeated, we'd expect to see its statutory profit levels drop, at least in the absence of strong growth.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Advanced Micro Devices' Profit Performance\n\nAs we have already discussed Advanced Micro Devices reported that it received a tax benefit, rather than paying tax, in the last year. Given that sort of benefit is not recurring, a focus on the statutory profit might make the company seem better than it really is. Because of this, we think that it may be that Advanced Micro Devices' statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power. But the happy news is that, while acknowledging we have to look beyond the statutory numbers, those numbers are still improving, with EPS growing at a very high rate over the last year. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. Ultimately, this article has formed an opinion based on historical data. However, it can also be great to think about what analysts are forecasting for the future. So feel free to check out our free graph representing analyst forecasts.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Advanced Micro Devices' profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\n\nHave feedback on this article?
