The GPU maker's market cap already tops $4.4 trillion. I suspect that Nvidia will indeed be worth at least $5 trillion in the not-too-distant future.\n\nHowever, other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are more of a stretch. Still, I believe that some will join Nvidia in the $5 trillion club. In particular, I predict that Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) could hit a $5 trillion valuation by 2030. Here's how.\n\nLooking at Amazon's core businesses\n\nAmazon's market cap currently hovers around $2.36 trillion. It would have to more than double over the next five years for my prediction to be fulfilled. This almost certainly means that the company will need exceptional growth from its core businesses of e-commerce and cloud services. The good news is that both are already growing by double-digit percentages.\n\nTechnically, Amazon's North America segment includes businesses outside of e-commerce (notably, Whole Foods). However, most of the segment's revenue stems from e-commerce and advertising on its e-commerce platforms. In the second quarter of 2025, this revenue increased by 11% year over year. Amazon's international segment also consists primarily of e-commerce operations. This segment's revenue jumped 16% year over year in Q2.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), which claims the leading market share among cloud service providers, is growing even faster. The cloud unit's revenue soared 17.5% year over year in Q2.\n\nThese revenue growth rates should be nearly (but not quite) enough to propel Amazon to a market cap of $5 trillion over the next five years -- if the company's share price moves in tandem with revenue. However, stock prices tend to correlate even more strongly with earnings growth. Amazon's earnings continue to increase faster than its revenue. For example, the company's earnings skyrocketed 34.8% higher year over year in Q2.\n\nIf Amazon continues to deliver anywhere close to this level of earnings growth and its share price rises accordingly, a valuation of $5 trillion by 2030 should be easily attainable. The big question, of course, is whether or not Amazon can keep growing so robustly. I think it can, with AI tailwinds helping boost profits for its e-commerce business and fuel significant growth for AWS.\n\nNewer opportunities\n\nWe can't overlook Amazon's opportunities to grow in new markets, though. One major growth driver that's on the way soon is the Project Kuiper satellite internet service, which is scheduled to be available later this year.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the Q2 earnings call that \"an impressive amount of enterprise and government customers\" have already signed agreements to use Kuiper's service. He believes Kuiper will have performance and pricing competitive advantages over Elon Musk's Starlink. In addition, Jassy thinks that the integration between Project Kuiper and AWS will be attractive to customers.\n\nZoox is another Amazon business to watch. Its all-electric robotaxis are already available in Las Vegas. Zoox plans to expand into San Francisco, Austin, and Miami next. Fortune Business Insights projects the global robotaxi market could reach nearly $119 billion by 2031. Zoox won't have to capture of big chunk of this market to generate meaningful revenue for Amazon.\n\nI'm keeping my eyes on Amazon's quantum computing efforts, too. The company's prototype Ocelot chip can reduce the costs of quantum error correction by up to 90% versus current methods. AWS just might become a major player in the quantum computing market, which could be huge in the not-too-distant future.\n\nAn ambitious but achievable prediction\n\nAm I 100% confident that Amazon will sport a valuation of $5 trillion or more by 2030? No. A global recession could get in the way. Competition in e-commerce and cloud services could intensify. Amazon's forays into new markets could be less successful than hoped.\n\nThe odds are stacked against any stock more than doubling in only five years, especially one with a market cap already topping $2.3 trillion. But while my prediction is ambitious, I think it's achievable. My hunch is that Amazon will be in the $5 trillion club along with Nvidia and perhaps a couple of other companies by the end of this decade.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:47:27.265276+00:00"}

These 3 Semiconductor Stocks Could Be the Biggest Winners (Hint: Not Nvidia)", "summary": "There's still a lot of opportunity left in AI, and these three stocks look underpriced right now.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/13/tech-spend-1-trillion-semiconductor-stock-win/", "published_at": "2025-08-13T08:35:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "There's still a lot of opportunity left in AI, and these three stocks look underpriced right now.\n\nEvery month it seems like one company or another announces it is increasing its budget for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. Last month, Alphabet released plans for $85 billion in capital expenditures (capex) this year, up from its original 2025 outlook of $75 billion. Not to be outdone, Amazon, a week later, said it increased its capex budget to $118 billion, up from $100 billion.\n\nBig tech's spending is only set to climb higher over the next few years. Market researcher Dell'Oro Group forecasts the top 10 big tech companies will spend over $1 trillion on AI infrastructure in 2028. That's up from about $593 billion this year.\n\nNvidia has been one of the biggest winners of these companies' spending spree so far. Its GPUs play a crucial role in AI training and inference servers. Demand for its chips has pushed both its volume and pricing higher, and that's reflected in its incredible revenue and profit growth over the last three years. Roughly two and a half years into the generative AI revolution, the company saw its revenue climb another 69% year over year, with profits climbing 57% on an adjusted basis during its most recent quarter.\n\nBut Nvidia's strong results of the last three years don't necessarily make the stock a shoo-in to be a great investment over the next three years. In fact, the following three semiconductor stocks look like better investments right now to capitalize on the continued increase in AI spending by big tech.\n\n1. Marvell Technology\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL 0.63%) is the chipmaker behind custom AI chip designs from Amazon and Microsoft. Instead of GPUs, these custom chips, called XPUs, are designed to more exact specifications to optimize price performance for large language model training or inference.\n\nThe XPU opportunity is growing quickly, as big tech companies look to use more cost-efficient chips and reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Broadcom, another XPU maker, expects its three custom silicon customers to spend $60 billion to $90 billion on chips by 2027. Marvell sees a $55 billion opportunity for its customers by 2028. To put that in perspective, its revenue over the last four quarters totals $6.5 billion.\n\nAnd Marvell looks poised to capitalize on that opportunity. Microsoft recently upgraded the specifications of its next-generation Maia300 chip, according to a report from Fubon Research. And while that will push out the production timeline until late next year, it also suggests Microsoft will ramp up its production quickly.\n\nFubon expects 300,000 to 400,000 units ordered for the fourth quarter of 2026, with a similar pace of spending throughout 2027. That could mean $10 billion to $12 billion in annual revenue from a single chip design.\n\nMarvell also designs networking chips for getting the most out of GPUs and XPUs. Networking equipment ensures data moves quickly and efficiently from one server to another. That's essential for getting the most out of the processing capabilities of the expensive servers used for training and running AI systems.\n\nAs mentioned, it isn't the only company working with big tech on custom silicon solutions. Broadcom has several high-profile contracts as well, and just as many opportunities to expand its market share as Marvell.\n\nBut Broadcom's stock is far more expensive for new investors at the moment. Marvell trades for 27 times forward earnings estimates compared to a multiple of 45 for Broadcom. That makes Marvell a much better option for investors looking to capitalize on the rise of custom silicon.\n\n2. Micron Technology\n\nMicron Technology (MU 3.26%) is one of a handful of suppliers of memory chips. Perhaps the most important type of memory chip for generative AI is called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM. These chips are attached to GPUs, giving the processors access to data with minimal latency.\n\nMicron was a bit late to develop its HBM chips, but it has quickly caught up to the competition, and it's winning some big contracts. AMD tapped Micron to supply the HBM3E chips in its MI355X GPUs, which have shown promising results. AMD's newest chips could be poised to take share of the GPU market from Nvidia by offering competitive price performance.\n\nMicron plans to start production on its HBM4 chips next year, after delivering samples to potential customers in the first half of this year. Management says the new chips offer a 60% performance improvement over its current generation of chips with a 20% reduction in power consumption.\n\nHBM chips have been the biggest driver of Micron's results recently. Sales of HBM increased 50% sequentially, driving overall revenue up by 15% from its previous quarter and 51% from the previous year.\n\nAnd the continued ramp-up in HBM should drive expanding margins. Management's outlook calls for a 42% gross margin next quarter, up from 39% in its most recent quarter and 28% a year ago.\n\nThe company sees very strong profit growth in the near future as GPU and XPU makers continue to buy up its memory chips, but it faces significant risks. Since Micron manufactures its own chips, it spends heavily on tooling and capacity while demand increases. But if demand falls, it could see a sharp drop in profitability. That's exacerbated by the fact that memory chips aren't well differentiated and a customer could easily switch suppliers.\n\nStill, the stock currently trades for just 14 times earnings estimates. At that price, investors are getting a lot of potential. And if AI spending continues to rise as expected, this earnings cycle could extend well into the future, making the current price for Micron Technology a great opportunity for investors.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), known as TSMC for short, is the largest chip fabricator in the world. If Nvidia, Broadcom, Marvell, or anyone else wants a leading-edge chip design produced, they're probably going to work with TSMC. That's because it has some of the best technology in the world. As a result, roughly two-thirds of all silicon manufacturing spending goes to the Taiwanese company.\n\nTSMC's technology lead is supported by a virtuous cycle. Since the company commands a huge share of all spending, it has more money to reinvest in research and development (R&D) and building extra capacity. With more R&D spending, it's able to develop and perfect the next-generation processes faster, and it has the capacity to meet demand for new chips, bringing in even more revenue.\n\nThe company recently received several pieces of good news, further improving its competitive position in the industry. First, Intel said it wouldn't offer fabrication services for its newest-generation process. And if it didn't get a major customer under contract for its next-generation process, it would stop developing it entirely. That leaves one less competitor for TSMC as it ramps up its next-generation 2nm process.\n\nAnd TSMC received an exemption from the Trump administration's 100% tariff on foreign-sourced semiconductors. That exemption was likely due to huge commitments from the company to build factories in Arizona.\n\nBoth clear the way for TSMC to ramp up production of its 2nm process, which already has customers lined up. The company is reportedly charging a significant premium over the previous generation 3nm chips.

President Donald Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook last week, with Apple announcing a $600 billion investment in U.S. operations, while Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give 15% of revenue from Chinese goods to the U.S. government in exchange for the ability to sell chips to China.\n\nBut coffee chain Dutch Bros' (BROS 1.99%) stock soared last week on its own news, and after middling performance for most of the year, it's up more than 26%, beating the S&P 500's 9% rise.\n\nHere's why the market is loving Dutch Bros.\n\nBack to the basics\n\nInvestors love to get into a detailed earnings report or 10-K filing to see how a company's finances are doing. But the beginning of any great company is a great product. Dutch Bros sells coffee through its chain of just over 1,000 stores today, but its concept was built on innovative products, and that vibrant approach to coffee still drives the business.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the economics here are excellent, which furthers the investment thesis. But it starts with great coffee that customers love, and the high sales follow.\n\nCEO Christine Barone detailed the company's three-part plan to generate higher transaction growth. It involves menu innovation, paid advertising to enhance brand awareness as it rolls out in new regions, and leaning into the loyalty program.\n\nDutch Bros has always differentiated itself by launching its own branded beverages, and that's one way it stands out. Barone called it a mix of art and science, understanding what's trending in the coffee world and translating it into products that its customers want to drink. Some of the innovation is in the customized beverages, such as protein coffee and flavors like lavender, and some of that is in the menu itself. One of the initiatives it's working on is a pilot of a morning food menu, which is driving higher engagement and sales in the morning coffee run.\n\nPart of the product is the experience, and making its stores a positive experience involves rigorous systems and technology to ensure speed and effective customer service. The company takes things slow in that respect to ensure it has its systems in check before opening new stores or making any changes. Barone said that the food menu will roll out slowly through 2026 even though it's already demonstrating positive metrics, to ensure that stores are ready to handle it.\n\nPhenomenal performance\n\nThis fresh approach is driving incredible growth. Revenue increased 28% year over year in the 2025 second quarter, with a 6.1% increase in same-shop sales and a 3.7% increase in transactions.\n\nCompany-operated shop contribution margin was 31.1%, 0.3 percentage points higher than last year, and net income increased from $22.2 million to $38.4 million. Management raised full-year guidance after the report.\n\nMassive expansion\n\nDutch Bros recently hit the 1,000-store mark, up from less than 500 when it went public in 2021. It's planning to double its store count again, hitting 2,029 stores by 2029.\n\nThe company is deliberate in its store opening strategy, but it's going to need to accelerate to reach that target. It opened 31 stores in the second quarter, and plans for at least 160 this year, which means things are going to speed up in the second half of the year. It's going to need to open even faster over the next four years to hit that target, but as it refines and perfects its strategy, it should be easier.\n\nLonger term, it sees the opportunity for 7,000 stores, or seven times its current store count. It has already raised that from its original target of 4,000 stores, and that ceiling could be raised again as it builds its brand and generates consumer loyalty.\n\nDutch Bros is brimming with opportunity, and it's not surprising that investors are scooping it up.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:47:30.258684+00:00"}

Palantir is a leader in AI software and its stock is up by a whopping 530% over the last 12 months. Nvidia supplies the world's best AI data center chips and its stock has climbed by 74% over the same period.\n\nBut more and more companies are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses. Duolingo (DUOL -5.18%), for instance, operates the world's largest digital language education platform, and it offers a growing portfolio of AI features designed to accelerate the learning experience. Its stock has more than doubled over the past year on the back of the company's stellar operating results, which have been boosted by AI.\n\nIs there still time to buy Duolingo stock? Read on to find out.\n\nAI is creating new opportunities for Duolingo\n\nDuolingo owes its success to its mobile-first, gamified approach to education. It takes learning out of the classroom and places it at the fingertips of anyone with a smartphone, enabling them to move at their own pace.\n\nDuolingo had more than 128 million monthly active users during the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), which was a 24% increase from the year-ago period. The platform monetizes them in two ways: It shows ads to free users, and it sells subscriptions to those who want to unlock more features to accelerate their progress. A record 10.9 million users were subscribed in Q2, which was up 37% year over year.\n\nDuolingo Max is the platform's most expensive subscription tier, and it offers a growing list of AI features as a selling point. There is Explain My Answer, which provides users with personalized feedback after each lesson, and Roleplay, which uses a chatbot-style interface to help users practice their conversational skills in a language of their choice. Duolingo also launched a new tool for Max subscribers last year called Video Call, which features a digital avatar named Lily who helps users practice their speaking skills.\n\nMax subscribers represented a record 8% of the platform's total paying members during Q2, up from 7% in the first quarter just three months earlier. Its AI features are a step toward Duolingo's long-term goal to deliver a learning experience that rivals a human tutor, so expect penetration to continue to grow.\n\nDuolingo's revenue growth is accelerating\n\nDuolingo generated a record $252.3 million in revenue during Q2, which crushed even the high end of management's forecast of $241.5 million. The figure represented a 41% increase compared to the year-ago period, which marked an acceleration from the 38% growth the company delivered during the first quarter. Simply put, the business is carrying a ton of momentum right now.\n\nOn the back of the strong Q2 result, management increased its full-year revenue forecast for 2025 to more than $1 billion. This would be the first year in the company's history that revenue crosses the billion-dollar milestone.\n\nDuolingo also delivered a blistering second quarter at the bottom line. The business generated $44.8 million in net income, which was up by an eye-popping 84% from the year-ago period. Not many tech companies can deliver accelerating revenue growth without burning truckloads of cash at the bottom line, so Duolingo's consistent (and growing) profitability is an incredibly impressive achievement, and it's a key reason for its soaring stock price.\n\nDuolingo stock presents an opportunity for long-term investors\n\nDuolingo's business is certainly firing on all cylinders right now, but investors will have to pay a premium if they want to own a slice. Its stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20, which is a 22% premium to its long-term average of 16.4, dating back to when it went public in 2021:\n\nSince Duolingo is consistently profitable, investors can also value its stock using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- but it looks even more pricey by that metric. Based on the company's $2.40 in trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS), its P/E ratio is currently an eye-popping 152.3. That makes the stock five times more expensive than the Nasdaq-100 technology index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.9.\n\nThe stock looks a little more attractive if it is valued based on its future potential EPS. Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Duolingo could generate $6.64 in EPS during 2025, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 55.7. Analysts then expect $8.34 in EPS during 2026, which translates to a forward P/E ratio of 44.4:\n\nThe stock still isn't cheap on a forward basis, but investors who are willing to hold on to it for five years or more could still do well if they buy it at the current price, purely because the company's earnings are growing so quickly.\n\nShort-term investors who are looking for quick gains over the next 12 months or so should probably steer clear of Duolingo stock, but it could be an attractive buy for those with a longer-term outlook.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:47:31.586547+00:00"}

Software and systems empowered with AI solutions have the ability to change the corporate growth arc in America and around the world, which is why the analysts at PwC peg this global opportunity at a jaw-dropping $15.7 trillion by 2030.\n\nBut as we know from previous next-big-thing technologies, not every company will be or remain a winner. What's been particularly noteworthy about the rise of AI is how Wall Street's preeminent billionaire money managers have approached this opportunity.\n\nBased on sheer performance, graphics processing unit (GPU) colossus Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) and AI-data mining specialist Palantir Technologies (PLTR 2.30%) have been unstoppable. Since 2023 began, shares of Nvidia and Palantir have skyrocketed by roughly 1,150% and 2,810%!\n\nHowever, quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show these two AI leaders aren't as popular as you might believe with billionaire fund managers. Instead, another market-leading business stands tall as the undisputed favorite AI stock on Wall Street.\n\nMost billionaire investors have cashed in their chips with Nvidia and Palantir\n\nA 13F allows investors to track which stocks Wall Street's smartest fund managers have been buying and selling. Coincidentally, the deadline to file 13Fs for the June-ended quarter is tomorrow, Aug. 14.\n\nBased on 13Fs from previous quarters, billionaires have spoken loudly with their actions. Both Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office and Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital completely exited their respective stakes in Nvidia, while billionaires David Tepper of Appaloosa and Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management disposed of the bulk of their shares.\n\nIt's a similar story for Palantir, with Druckenmiller sending all of his fund's shares to the chopping block.\n\nAlthough both companies have exhibited phenomenal sales and profit growth, there are a couple of well-defined reasons for billionaire fund managers to be skeptical.\n\nArguably the biggest worry with the AI revolution is that history will repeat itself. Including the rise and proliferation of the internet, there hasn't been a game-changing innovation in over three decades that's avoided an early innings bubble-bursting event. Without fail, investors consistently overestimate the early stage utility and consumer/enterprise adoption of new technologies, which eventually leads to lofty expectations not being met. If an AI bubble were to form and burst, it would be terrible news for Nvidia and Palantir.\n\nThe other historical overhang for Nvidia and Palantir is their respective premium valuations. Though Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't egregiously high, its trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of more than 30 is in-line with other cutting-edge businesses that peaked during the dot-com era.\n\nPalantir's premium is considerably higher than Nvidia's. Whereas most industry leaders top out at P/S ratios of 30 to 40, Palantir is tipping the scales at a P/S ratio of 137, as of the closing bell on Aug. 8. No megacap company has ever been able to sustain a premium of this magnitude, and Palantir, despite its irreplaceable Gotham and Foundry platforms, is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nWhile billionaire fund managers have been content to reduce or remove Nvidia and Palantir stock from their portfolios, there's another industry-leading AI stock they're all in on.\n\nThis is the undisputed favorite AI stock of billionaire money managers\n\nAmong the dozens upon dozens of companies making AI a cornerstone of their future growth plans, none has been more sought after by billionaire investors than Meta Platforms (META 3.16%). Based on 13Fs filed in mid-May for trading activity that concluded March 31, four billionaire asset managers listed Meta as their fund's top holding:\n\nChase Coleman of Tiger Global Management : 16.18% of invested assets.\n\n: 16.18% of invested assets. Terry Smith of Fundsmith : 10.19% of invested assets.\n\n: 10.19% of invested assets. Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management : 9.55% of invested assets.\n\n: 9.55% of invested assets. Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital: 8.75% of invested assets.\n\nIn addition to being the No. 1 holding for four prominent fund managers, it's the third largest position, excluding put and call options, for Israel Englander of Millennium Management, the No. 6 holding for Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management (also excluding options), and the 10th biggest holding for Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management. In other words, there's no doubt whatsoever that Meta Platforms is the clear favorite AI stock of billionaire investors.\n\nThe interesting quirk about Meta is that, for the moment, it's almost exclusively an advertising-driven company. Through the first six months of 2025, just shy of 98% of its $89.8 billion in sales traced back to advertising on the company's social media sites, which include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Facebook Messenger.\n\nNo social media company comes remotely close to the 3.48 billion daily active people Meta attracted to its family of apps in June. Businesses are willing to pay a premium to get their message(s) in front of users, and there's no better platform to do that with than Meta.\n\nBut advertising is also where artificial intelligence is laying its roots for Meta. Integrating generative AI solutions into its advertising platform is allowing businesses to tailor and create messages for specific users, with the ultimate goal of improving click-through rate. The fact that Meta Platforms absolutely blew Wall Street's consensus revenue forecast out of the water during the June-ended quarter is an indication that its investments in AI are paying off.\n\nLooking a bit further down the line, Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg aims to use AI as a tool to monetize the metaverse -- the 3D virtual world where users can interact with each other and their environment. Meta is positioning itself to be an on-ramp to the metaverse, and Zuckerberg has a lengthy track record of slow-stepping the monetization of new products and services until the time is right.\n\nAnother factor that's helping Meta succeed, and which may be coercing billionaire fund managers to pile in, is the company's enormous cash pile. It closed out the June quarter with a little over $47 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and is pacing nearly $100 billion in net cash generation from operating activities for the full year. A sizable treasure chest allows Meta to take risks that few other companies can afford to.\n\nLastly, Meta's valuation remains reasonable. Even though its forward P/E of 25.8 is 22% above its average forward P/E over the trailing-five-year period, Meta has consistently blown past consensus earnings estimates and looks to maintain an annual sales growth rate of 15% or greater for the foreseeable future.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:47:33.452481+00:00"}

Following the news of new tariffs, in combination with intensifying competition in China, the company's shares plummeted by as much as 30% earlier this year, wiping out nearly $1 trillion in market value.\n\nSuch precipitous declines may have suggested that Nvidia's best days were in the rearview mirror, but the stock's more recent performance says otherwise.\n\nAs of Aug. 7, it had rebounded by 93% from its 2025 lows and now has a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world.\n\nWith such strong momentum fueling the stock to new highs, is it too late to invest in Nvidia? Read on to find out.\n\nBig tech is spending big bucks on Nvidia's chips\n\nNvidia's largest source of revenue is its computing and networking business. This segment comprises the company's data center services and highly coveted graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nA good way to gauge the health of its business is to look at spending on artificial intelligence (AI). The chart below illustrates capital expenditures over the last three years for cloud hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, along with social media company Meta Platforms.\n\nThese \"Magnificent Seven\" companies prove that accelerating AI infrastructure spending is a powerful tailwind for Nvidia's chip empire.\n\nBeyond the usual tech titan suspects, rising adoption of cloud infrastructure services from Oracle -- as well as neocloud platforms such as Nebius Group and CoreWeave -- offer another source for GPU demand, especially for Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture. Neoclouds are gaining interest at the moment as they offer flexible software-hardware stacks in the form of high-performance computing (HPC) services and access to GPU clusters via cloud-based infrastructures.\n\nNew opportunities are emerging\n\nOver the last few years, investors have repeatedly heard pundits chirp about the importance of data centers in powering generative AI development. This point is valid, but I think many investors are missing the broader picture when it comes to the evolution of AI infrastructure spending.\n\nA new phase of AI adoption involves sophisticated workloads across robotics, autonomous driving, and quantum computing. Companies such as Alphabet and Tesla are beginning to monetize their autonomous vehicles, while Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are all developing their own custom quantum computing chips.\n\nNvidia has just started to scale up its chips and CUDA software platform across these emerging opportunities. Given the company's existing deep integration with big tech, I'm optimistic that its product suite will still be crucial in future, more-advanced AI development.\n\nWhat will Nvidia stock be worth by the end of 2025?\n\nThe chart below illustrates the company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple throughout the AI revolution.\n\nGiven the trends cited above, the forward P/E range between 24 and 30 could be seen as a support zone or valuation floor for Nvidia. Each time its forward P/E dipped into this range, the stock has rebounded strongly. To me, this suggests that investors still see robust long-term growth for the company despite occasional fleeting periods of souring sentiment.\n\nI think these valuation trends subtly imply that the market could be underestimating the full breadth of Nvidia's ubiquitous platform. Despite the company's influence across AI infrastructure, many investors still view it purely through the lens of a semiconductor business. As these new opportunities are realized, I think the stock is well positioned for a prolonged breakout -- similar to the initial wave of AI-driven enthusiasm a couple of years ago.\n\nAlthough its forward P/E is fast-approaching prior highs, I think there is a solid case to be made that the company is positioned for further valuation expansion and could reach or exceed historical levels.

But Nvidia's visionary CEO, Jensen Huang, saw the broad potential of these advanced chips before anyone else.\n\nWhen the GPU was initially released, AI applications were both niche and barely imagined. But Huang understood that the world's most important problems would be solved by anticipating latent needs -- capabilities that people will demand at some point in the future, even if they can't fully describe them today.\n\nHuang realized that GPUs could be parlayed for more sophisticated problem solving that traditional CPUs at the time could not handle efficiently, ultimately becoming the foundational layer on which artificial intelligence (AI) modeling, research, and data analytics are built.\n\nIn a similar fashion, internet and cloud computing juggernaut Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) has been quietly pushing the envelope in a new pocket of the AI realm that's gaining attention: quantum computing.\n\nLet's dive into Alphabet's innovative approach to developing quantum applications and explore how the company's progress parallels that of Nvidia's pioneering role in AI before it went mainstream.\n\nHow is Alphabet building quantum computing applications?\n\nBack in December, Alphabet unveiled its latest breakthrough in the quantum computing arms race: a processor called Willow. With 105 qubits and enhanced algorithmic features across error correction, Willow might appear as just another incremental improvement over prior generations of quantum chips released by Alphabet and its peers.\n\nWhere Willow caught the attention of AI enthusiasts was through an experiment in Random Circuit Sampling (RCS), in which its quantum processing was measured against classical supercomputers. In this study, Alphabet claims that Willow solved a sophisticated series of computations in under 5 minutes that would take today's most capable supercomputers an estimated 10 septillion years to complete.\n\nWhy Alphabet is to quantum computing what Nvidia is to AI\n\nWhile Alphabet's quantum supremacy may not have ample commercial uses today, the idea here is that the company's innovations and technological breakthroughs are similar to that of Nvidia and the invention of the GPU back in the late 1990s. Willow and the GPU both represent underlying proof that Alphabet and Nvidia have been at the forefront of innovations where conventional approaches are not able to compete at scale.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, Alphabet is not building its AI business through a singular lens. Under its umbrella, Alphabet has TensorFlow -- an open-source machine learning platform. In addition, Alphabet's Google Quantum AI team operates an open-source software framework called Cirq, which helps Python developers research and build applications. Lastly, Google DeepMind serves as a research lab spanning various aspects of the AI spectrum, including quantum computing.\n\nTo me, the formation of Alphabet's AI ecosystem aligns closely with Nvidia's approach. Outside of its hardware specialty, Nvidia also offers software through its CUDA infrastructure. This decision ultimately created a virtuous cycle in which developers building generative AI applications continually demand additional GPU and software capacity -- leading to a self-reinforcing technological moat for Nvidia.\n\nI think Alphabet is employing a similar strategy, betting that classical computing will eventually become exhausted by increasingly sophisticated AI workloads. When this occurs, Alphabet will have already architected the leap from classical to quantum computing.\n\nJust as Nvidia has done throughout the AI revolution thanks to its GPUs and software platform, Alphabet could one day be positioned as the main ecosystem on which quantum applications are developed.\n\nIs Alphabet stock a buy right now?\n\nThroughout the AI revolution, many of Alphabet's peers have experienced notable expansion in their valuation multiples.\n\nAt the moment, however, Alphabet is trading roughly in line with its three-year average forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio. Not only is the valuation discount to its peers striking, but I think it's overstated.\n\nOver the last three years, Alphabet has continued to innovate across several areas of AI, including new capabilities in search, video, e-commerce, cybersecurity, and of course, hardware such as quantum chips. Nevertheless, the upside from these investments do not appear to be fully priced into the company's long-term financial success.\n\nJust as Nvidia has proven to be one of the most lucrative long-term buys of the decade, I see Alphabet positioned to follow a prolonged breakout period featuring notable valuation expansion as its AI-powered products continue to scale and become a more central part of the company's growth narrative. For these reasons, I think that Alphabet stock is dirt cheap and looks like a compelling opportunity at its current price level.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:47:46.149564+00:00"}

The IPO raised $1.5 billion. Lockup periods prevent company insiders from selling stock. With a much bigger float, CoreWeave stock could be pressured, analysts say.\n\nCoreWeave Stock Technical Ratings\n\nCoreWeave's biggest customer is Microsoft (MSFT), followed by Meta Platforms (META). Microsoft is the biggest investor in generative AI startup OpenAI, which is the leader in building AI models and launched ChatGPT. OpenAI has signed its own multiyear deal with CoreWeave.\n\nWhile some analysts project a big AI market opportunity for CoreWeave, others fret about customer concentration and high debt.\n\nMeanwhile, CoreWeave stock owns a Composite Rating of 70 out of a best possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. Also, CoreWeave stock has a relatively small float, making it more volatile. The Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths.\n\nMeanwhile, CoreWeave stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. (A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.)\n\nAdditionally, CoreWeave is among the top AI stocks to watch.

But, not every market-beating stock has been an AI technology name -- or even a growth name -- during this stretch. Warren Buffett and his team have proven their mettle once again, leading value-oriented Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.90%) (BRK.B 1.17%) to a market-beating performance of its own since the middle of 2020.\n\nBack in fighting form\n\nIf you had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway shares in early August of 2020, as I write this on Aug. 10, you'd be sitting on $2,221. That's an annualized growth rate of 17.3%, outpacing the S&P 500 's (^GSPC 1.13%) average annual growth pace of 13.8%, or 15.5% when factoring in reinvested dividends.\n\nMaking this five-year run even more impressive is that Berkshire has performed relatively poorly since May. That's not only when Buffett announced his end-of-year retirement, but also when investors began shedding their defensive value stocks that Buffett's conglomerate holds so they could plow back into growth-oriented technology names. It's still well ahead despite the headwind.\n\nThere's also some vindication in this market-beating performance.\n\nYou may recall that Berkshire's persistent underperformance for several years prior to 2021's rekindled leadership was prompting criticisms and questions of his old-school stock-picking approach. The past three years have reminded everyone that patience pays off when you prioritize owning quality businesses rather than chasing growth.\n\nBuying and holding quality is always a sound strategy\n\nDon't misunderstand. Just as it did for several years prior to 2021, there will come another time when Berkshire Hathaway shares lag the market. That's just the nature of Warren Buffett's value-minded style -- it tends to underperform when investors are captivated by new, game-changing industries.\n\nJust remember the past five years the next time that happens, and the past three years in particular.

Lee added that he anticipates “strong” demand for the chips the Trump administration is allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell.\n\nBeijing’s stance could limit Trump’s ability to turn his export control about-face into a windfall for government coffers, a deal that highlighted his administration’s transactional approach to national security policies long treated as nonnegotiable.\n\nShares of Chinese AI chip designer Cambricon Technologies Corp. surged to their daily limit of 20% on the news of China’s guidance, leading a rally in peers such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.\n\nBut even with Trump’s team on board, the two companies face the challenge that their Chinese customers are under Beijing’s pressure to purchase domestic chips instead. Beijing’s overall push affects AI accelerators from AMD in addition to Nvidia, one of the people said, though it’s unclear whether any letters specifically mentioned AMD’s MI308 chip.\n\nNvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. both recently secured Washington’s approval to resume lower-end AI chip sales to China, on the controversial and legally questionable condition that they give the US government a 15% cut of the related revenue.\n\nThe letters didn’t, however, constitute an outright ban on H20 use, according to the people. Industry analysts broadly agree that Chinese companies still covet those chips, which perform quite well in certain crucial AI applications. President Donald Trump said Monday that the processor “still has a market” in the Asian country despite also calling it “obsolete.”\n\nOver the past few weeks, Chinese authorities have sent notices to a range of firms discouraging use of the less-advanced semiconductors, people familiar with the matter said. The guidance was particularly strong against the use of H20s for any government or national security-related work by state enterprises or private companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is sensitive.\n\nBeijing has urged local companies to avoid using Nvidia Corp.’s H20 processors, particularly for government-related purposes, complicating the chipmaker’s return to China after the Trump administration reversed an effective US ban on such sales.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy said he doesn’t anticipate that Nvidia’s processor sales to China will be affected because “Chinese companies are going to want to use the best chips available.” Nvidia and AMD’s chips are superior to local alternatives, he said.\n\nBeijing asked companies about that issue in some of its letters, according to one of the people, posing questions such as why they buy Nvidia H20 chips over local versions, whether that’s a necessary choice given domestic options, and whether they’ve found any security concerns in the Nvidia hardware. The notices coincide with state media reports that cast doubt on the security and reliability of H20 processors. Chinese regulators have raised those concerns directly with Nvidia, which has repeatedly denied that its chips contain such vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that some Chinese companies are planning to decrease orders of Nvidia chips in response to the letters.\n\nRight now, the people said, China’s most stringent chip guidance is limited to sensitive applications, a situation that bears similarities to the way Beijing restricted Tesla Inc. vehicles and Apple Inc. iPhones in certain institutions and locations over security concerns. China’s government also at one point barred the use of Micron Technology Inc. chips in critical infrastructure.\n\nIt’s possible that Beijing may extend its heavier-handed Nvidia and AMD guidance to a wider range of settings, according to one person with direct knowledge of the deliberations, who said that those conversations are in early stages.\n\nAMD declined to comment on Beijing’s notices, while Nvidia said in a statement that “the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure.” China has ample supplies of domestic chips, Nvidia said, and “won’t and never has relied on American chips for government operations.”\n\nChina’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Cyberspace Administration of China didn’t respond to faxed requests for comment on this story, which is based on interviews with more than a half-dozen people familiar with Beijing’s policy discussions. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Chinese government’s posture raises questions about the Trump administration’s explanation for why the US is allowing those exports mere months after effectively banning such sales. Multiple senior US officials have said their policy reversal was the result of trade talks with China, but Beijing has publicly indicated that the resumed H20 shipments weren’t part of any bilateral deal. China’s recent notices to companies suggest that the Asian country may not have sought such a concession from Washington in the first place.\n\nBeijing’s concerns are twofold. For starters, Chinese officials are worried that Nvidia chips could have location-tracking and remote-shutdown capabilities — a suggestion that Nvidia has vehemently denied. Trump officials are actively exploring whether location tracking could be used to help curtail suspected smuggling of restricted components into China, and lawmakers have introduced a bill that would require location verification for advanced AI chips.\n\nSecond, Beijing is intensely focused on developing its domestic chip capabilities, and wants Chinese companies to shift away from Western chips in favor of local offerings. Officials have previously urged Chinese firms to choose domestic semiconductors over Nvidia H20 processors, Bloomberg reported last September, and have introduced energy efficiency standards that the H20 chip doesn’t meet.\n\nNvidia designed the H20 chip specifically for Chinese customers to abide by years of US restrictions on sales of its more advanced hardware, curbs designed to limit Beijing’s access to AI that could benefit the Chinese military. The H20 chip has less computational power than Nvidia’s top offerings, but its strong memory bandwidth is quite well suited to the inference stage of AI development, when models recognize patterns and draw conclusions.\n\nThat’s made it a desirable product to companies like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. in China, where domestic chip champion Huawei Technologies Co. is struggling to produce enough advanced components to meet market demand. By one estimate from Biden officials — who considered but did not implement controls on H20 sales — losing access to that Nvidia chip would make it three to six times more expensive for Chinese companies to run inference on advanced AI models.\n\n“Beijing appears to be using regulatory uncertainty to create a captive market sufficiently sized to absorb Huawei’s supply, while still allowing purchases of H20s to meet actual demands,” said Lennart Heim, an AI-focused researcher at RAND, of China’s push for companies to avoid American AI chips. “This signals that domestic alternatives remain inadequate even as China pressures foreign suppliers.”\n\nIn his remarks Monday, Trump said China’s Huawei already offers chips comparable to the Nvidia H20, echoing previous remarks by officials in his administration who’ve defended the decision to resume H20 exports partly on those grounds. The US should keep the Chinese AI ecosystem reliant on less-advanced American technology for as long as possible, these officials say, in order to deprive Huawei of the revenue and know-how that would come from a broader customer base.\n\nOther administration officials have strongly objected to that logic, Bloomberg has reported, arguing that resuming H20 exports will only embolden China’s tech champions and bolster the country’s overall computing power.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump officials have also claimed that the H20 move was part of a deal to improve American access to Chinese rare-earth minerals — despite the Trump team’s previous assertions that such an arrangement wasn’t on the table. “As the Chinese deliver their magnets, then the H20s will come off,” Lutnick said last month. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in late July that the magnet issue had been “solved.”\n\nThe first Nvidia H20 and AMD MI308 licenses arrived a bit over a week after Bessent’s declaration — after Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang met with the president and both companies agreed to share their China revenue with the US government.\n\n--With assistance from Yanping Li, Sangmi Cha and Emily Forgash.\n\n(Updates with additional analyst commentary in ninth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:48:30.731503+00:00"}

While there's no outright ban, people familiar with the matter say the guidance has been particularly strong for state-owned enterprises and firms working on sensitive contracts. Shares of local chipmakers like Cambricon Technologies reacted sharply, jumping to their daily limit, as investors bet that Beijing's stance could accelerate adoption of domestic semiconductors.\n\nThe strategy appears aimed at two objectives: tightening security and bolstering China's homegrown chip industry. Regulators have been asking companies to explain why they're still buying H20s over domestic alternatives and whether those purchases are justified. State media has amplified concerns over the H20's reliability allegations Nvidia has publicly denied. For now, the most stringent guidance is confined to high-security use cases, echoing earlier limits on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles and Apple (AAPL) iPhones in certain facilities, but discussions are underway that could broaden restrictions. Industry analysts note that while domestic AI chips are improving fast, they may not yet match the H20's versatility for some workloads, leaving a potential gap in China's supply chain if restrictions tighten.\n\nThe H20 was purpose-built for China to comply with years of US export controls, sacrificing peak compute power but offering strong memory bandwidth for AI inference a sweet spot for companies like Alibaba and Tencent. Some US officials argue that continued sales could keep China dependent on less-advanced US technology, slowing Huawei's rise, while others warn it could end up strengthening China's AI ecosystem. With Beijing signaling a long-term push toward self-sufficiency, the real question is whether this guidance stays targeted or evolves into a broader policy that reshapes the competitive balance between US and Chinese chipmakers.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:48:32.585721+00:00"}

Economists expected the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) to rise 0.2% in July and the core CPI to climb 0.3%...and that’s exactly what happened. Behind the headline figures, the big story is that tariff hikes are NOT resulting in widespread, painful price hikes...at least not yet.

This data keeps a potential 25-basis-point rate reduction firmly in play.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump just extended the current 90-day trade détente between the US and China for another 90 days. The deadline extension means that the US will continue to charge a 30% tariff on Chinese imports, while China will continue to charge a 10% levy on US imports.\n\nFinally, stablecoins and stablecoin growth have been all the rage in the cryptocurrency arena. Now, we’ve just gotten the first post-IPO earnings release from USDC issuer Circle Internet Group Inc.

While that might surprise investors in Navitas Semiconductor who've only been watching it in 2025, as it's up 85% so far this year, it does highlight some points about investing in growth stocks.\n\nWhy Navitas Semiconductor's stock has gone up so much in 2025\n\nThe simple reason for this year's jump comes down to the mid-May announcement of a partnership with Nvidia to develop data center power architecture for the next generation of data centers, due to launch in 2027. The new more efficient, reliable, and lower-maintenance cost 800 V data centers need silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) chips (Navitas' specialty) in the power conversion process in the new data centers.\n\nConsiderations for growth investors\n\nThe fact that the stock is down over the last couple of years indicates that patience is key when investing in growth stocks, and it pays to avoid getting caught up in euphoria. For example, in the summer of 2023, Navitas offered 11.5 million shares at a price of $8, which the market eagerly took up. Unfortunately, some of its key end markets, like electric vehicles and consumer electronics (notably mobile phones), slowed markedly, and the stock declined.\n\nHowever, it makes sense to buy into weakness if you have data-backed belief in the long-term growth prospects of a company.

And despite repeated calls from Trump to lower interest rates, the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady for the fifth meeting in a row at the end of July.\n\nMeanwhile, the second-quarter earnings season got into swing in July, with Wall Street banks and major companies globally reporting results. In late July, the \" Magnificent 7\" drew much of the market attention , with six of this group of tech giants having reported by the end of the month. While the companies delivered earnings beats, market reaction to the results was mixed, as investor expectations remain high around their performance.\n\nTariff deals were announced with the likes of Vietnam, Japan and the European Union over the course of the month. However, Trump then announced additional higher levies on India and Brazil at the end of July, shortly before his 1 August deadline.\n\nIn early July, US president Donald Trump announced a further extension onto the 90-day delay of Washington imposing higher tariffs, that were unveiled on \"Liberation Day\" on 2 April. This pushed back the date for implementing higher tariffs on a number of trading partners from 9 July to 1 August, a deadline that was later extended to 7 August.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith that in mind, here's which stocks and funds proved most popular with investors in July:\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nTesla (TSLA) featured on both the most popular stocks lists of Robinhood UK and Interactive Investor, despite continued weak performance.\n\nThe company was the first of the Mag 7 to report in the latest earnings season, getting the group off to a downbeat start, as it slightly missed Wall Street estimates.\n\nTesla (TSLA) posted second-quarter revenue of $22.5bn (£16.6bn) compared with $22.64bn expected by Bloomberg consensus. This is a 12% drop compared with the $25.05bn reported a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.40 compared with expectations of $0.42, while operating income of $923m was also lower than the expected $1.23bn.\n\nRead more: Over 3.6 million UK investors to pay dividend tax\n\n\"We continue to expand our vehicle offering, including first builds of a more affordable model in June, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025,\" the company said in a statement. Tesla (TSLA) also said its purpose-built robotaxi was still scheduled for volume production starting in 2026.\n\nIn an earnings call, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company could experience \"a few rough quarters\", when asked about the expiration of EV tax credits, with the Trump administration set to cut these incentives.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said Tesla (TSLA) shares have had a \"rocky ride\", as they are down 16% year-to-date.\n\n\"Nonetheless, some remain convinced by the company’s recovery and longer-term potential,\" he said.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nAs Tesla shares have continued to come under pressure, chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has notched fresh highs, highlighting that divergence in performance among the Mag 7.\n\nWhile Nvidia (NVDA) hasn't yet reported its latest quarterly earnings, investor enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence (AI) propelled shares higher last month, seeing it become the first company to hit a $4tn market capitalisation.\n\nNews that the US government u-turned on its curbs of sales of the company's AI chips to China offered a further boost to the stock last month, with shares now up nearly 36% year-to-date. However, it was reported on Monday that Nvidia (NVDA) and fellow chipmaker AMD (AMD) had agreed to give the US government 15% of their revenues from chip sales in China.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThis deal is likely to be in focus for investors going into Nvidia's (NVDA) second-quarter earnings, which are due to be released on 27 August.\n\nCommenting on the news of the chipmakers' deal with the US government, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Nvidia’s (NVDA) Q1 revenue took at $2.5bn hit due to restrictions on H20 sales to China, but it clearly believes the 15% contribution is well worth it, to keep access to the vast and fast developing market. The unusual arrangement is another example of a mega tech company acquiescing to the US administration’s demands, to gain an upper hand as trade relations are redrawn.\"\n\nFor the second quarter, Nvidia (NVDA) had previously guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2%.\n\nMetals One (MET1.L)\n\nLondon-listed minerals exploration company Metals One (MET1.L) emerged as the most-bought stock on Interactive Investor's July list, with shares up nearly 63% year-to-date.\n\nInteractive Investor's Hunt said: \"Somewhere towards the top of the risk spectrum are small exploration companies and one in particular has caught the eye of the most determined II customers\"\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nThe company currently has a market cap of £34.63m and a share price of 7.08p, at the time of writing.\n\n\"Unknown in February when the shares traded at 2.4p, feverish speculation in May around a potential acquisition in Norway which would give the company access to gold, copper and nickel deposits, was followed by unsubstantiated claims from outside the company of a massive uranium find,\" said Hunter.\n\nDefence has remained a popular theme with investors, with FTSE 100-listed (^FTSE) Rolls-Royce (RR.L) appearing once more on Interactive Investor's most bought list.\n\nShares are up 91% year-to-date, lifting the company to a market cap of $90.8bn, though Hunter said this \"has not been enough to deter followers of the stock because of valuation concerns\".\n\nThe stock is now up 1069% on a five-year basis, with the most recent jump coming on the back of the company's half-year results, released in late July.\n\nRead more: Defence companies post strong results as UK investors back the sector over AI\n\nThe aero-engineer reported an underlying operating profit of £1.76bn in the first half of the year, versus £1.15bn a year ago. Underlying revenue of £9.06bn was also up on the £8.18bn Rolls-Royce (RR.L) reported in the first half of last year.\n\nHunter said that Rolls-Royce (RR.L) reported \"strong progress across each of its divisions. With flying hours on the increase and with no signs of defence spending wavering, the story may yet have further to run\".\n\nPalantir (PLTR)\n\nCombining both the themes of defence and AI is data software company Palantir (PLTR), which was among the top-traded stocks on the Robinhood UK platform in July.\n\nRobinhood UK's Lane said that Palantir (PLTR) \"rallied to new all-time highs in July, with a $100m government contract making the headlines, along with news of a new product in the works, designed to plan, build and review applications on the Palantir platform\".\n\nShares are up 141% year-to-date, with the stock having risen on the back of its second-quarter earnings, released in early August.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) posted earnings per share of $0.16 for the quarter, beating consensus estimates of $0.14 and up 77% from the same period last year. Revenue came in at $1.004bn, Palantir's first quarter surpassing the billion-dollar mark on a quarterly basis. The company's top line also beat analyst forecasts for $939.25bn and was up 48% year-over-year.\n\nMost popular funds in July\n\nAs buoyant sentiment drove markets higher last month, investors continued to put money into US and global passive funds in June, giving them exposure to some of the world's biggest companies, such as the \"Magnificent 7\" tech behemoths.\n\nSam Benstead, fixed income lead at Interactive Investor, said: \"Looking at passives, low-cost, global funds were popular in July’s top 10, including Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index and HSBC FTSE All-World Index. It’s always sensible to take a quick look at the country allocation in the fund factsheet before investing, so that you can get the right fit for your portfolio. For example, some global funds invest in developing markets and some don’t.\"\n\nThe active fund that appeared in both Interactive Investor and Hargreaves Lansdown's top 10 lists was Artemis Global Income (0P0000W36K.L).\n\nAccording to a fund update, published at the end of last month, the fund rose 11.7% in the second quarter, compared with gains of 5.0% from its MSCI AC World benchmark and 2.8% from its IA Global Equity Income sector average.\n\nThe biggest contributor to outperformance was the fund's some 20% exposure to aerospace and defence, which includes holdings in Germany's Rheinmetall (RHM.DE) and BAE Systems (BA.L).\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:48:47.427771+00:00"}

Here’s what I’m listening to: PinkPantheress, Lola Young and Evita in London.\n\nPrivileges with the president\n\nDonald Trump announced this week that two US chipmakers would tithe 15% of their revenue from sales in China to the US government. Paying for the license to sell to Chinese customers represents an unprecedented deal.\n\nMy colleague Helen Davidson reports from Taipei:\n\nThe chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the US government 15% of their revenue from advanced chips sold to China in return for export licences to the key market.\n\nThe arrangement will lead to Nvidia giving 15% of its revenue from Chinese sales of its H20 chips, and AMD giving 15% of revenue from Chinese sales of its MI308 chips, according to reports citing US officials.\n\nThe H20 and MI308 chips were banned from sale to China in April, despite the lower-powered H20 being designed specifically to abide by restrictions introduced by the Biden administration.\n\nNvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, head of the most valuable company in the world at $4.44tn, has been lobbying the White House for months to open up sales in China, where the US still prohibits sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips over national security concerns. In July, Trump relaxed some restrictions imposed by Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nThe deal with Nvidia and AMD seems as much about personally appealing to Trump as it does about generating revenue for the US government. The agreement has all the trappings of Trump entering into business with the chipmakers.\n\nIn a way, it’s a version of a playbook other major tech companies have been trying out as Trump is dramatically changing the international business landscape. Apple announced a $100bn investment commitment in US manufacturing. CEO Tim Cook, who had made the journey to the White House himself, presented Trump with a glass trophy (including 24 karat gold base) designating the president a graduate of the Apple Manufacturing Academy, launched in Michigan the week prior.\n\nDuring his meeting with Cook, Trump said he would levy a 100% tariff on semiconductor chips, which could set both Apple and Nvidia back billions. However, the president said: “If you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.”\n\nBoth Nvidia and Apple are likely to be exempted from the tariffs. Each appears to have paid for the privilege – Apple with its domestic investment, Nvidia with its revenue-sharing agreement.\n\nOpenAI debuts GPT-5\n\nOpenAI launched the new version of the artificial intelligence that underpins ChatGPT last week. There are quite a few aspects of the release to consider to understand it fully – what the company is saying, where the AI race between tech giants stands, the model’s new capabilities and pitfalls, the environmental impact – so I’ve rounded up the Guardian’s coverage of GPT-5 below.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:48:49.203268+00:00"}

While revenue outpaced Wall Street’s expectations, management pointed to substantial progress in gross margin improvement, citing the impact of Project Quantum Leap initiatives, cost reductions, and optimized service execution. CEO Andy Marsh acknowledged the company’s focus on operational discipline, noting, “Gross margins improved dramatically, moving from negative 92% in Q2 of last year to negative 31% this quarter.” Management attributed these gains to better pricing, streamlined operations, and a more reliable hydrogen supply network.\n\nLooking forward, Plug Power’s strategy is centered on reaching gross margin neutrality by the end of the year and positioning for positive EBITDA in 2026. Management emphasized the benefits of recent U.S. policy changes, including extended production and investment tax credits, which are seen as catalysts for both customer demand and project economics. CFO Paul Middleton outlined expectations for further efficiency gains, stating, “The combination of service cost reductions, improved hydrogen supply pricing, and ongoing operational restructuring will continue to drive margin enhancement.” Plug Power’s expansion of its hydrogen generation network, robust electrolyzer sales funnel, and disciplined capital management remain key to its long-term outlook.\n\nKey Insights from Management’s Remarks\n\nManagement credited quarterly revenue momentum to increased hydrogen platform adoption and deliberate cost control, while also outlining several structural steps taken to enhance margins and strengthen the business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:48:54.940821+00:00"}

During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 8.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $1.00 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.26 points to a change of +42.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.65 indicates a change of +32.5% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

The bank lifted its price target, saying the company's artificial intelligence ramp remains intact, signaling confidence that CoreWeave can keep delivering growth in a competitive market.\n\nJPMorgan's upbeat call landed alongside a flurry of big-name analyst moves. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) drew fresh optimism from Wells Fargo, which sees another 20% upside after reports of a China export license agreement. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), and miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) also made the day's biggest analyst calls list.\n\nInvestors of CoreWeave are now concerned with its next quarterly earnings. The demand in AI remains high, and Wall Street is continually shifting the goal posts high, hence causing greater fluctuations in the stock in the days to come.

We started specializing our GPUs for it and developing lots of software to support it, engaging with the researchers all around the world who were doing it, long before it was clearly relevant.”\n\nFor a while that was building better GPUs for artificial intelligence. Nvidia was early to the future AI boom and started tinkering with the idea of AI GPUs in 2010 — more than a decade before the current AI frenzy.\n\n“We try to figure out what will make the most positive difference for the company because we’re constantly seeing exciting new areas, but some of them, they do great work, but we have trouble saying if [we’ll be] wildly successful at this,” Dally said.\n\nWhen Dally took over the lab in 2009, expansion was first and foremost. Researchers started working on areas outside of ray tracing right away, including circuit design and VLSI, or very large-scale integration, a process that combines millions of transistors on a single chip.\n\n“It wound up being kind of a perfect fit for my interests and my talents,” Dally said. “I think everybody’s always searching for the place in life where they can make the biggest contribution to the world. And I think for me, it’s definitely Nvidia.”\n\nDavid Kirk, who was running the research lab at the time, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, thought a more permanent position at the research lab was a better idea. Dally told TechCrunch the pair put on a “full-court press” on why he should join Nvidia’s research lab and eventually convinced him.\n\nDally, now Nvidia’s chief scientist, started consulting for Nvidia in 2003 while he was working at Stanford. When he was ready to step down from being the department chair of Stanford’s computer science department a few years later, he planned to take a sabbatical. Nvidia had a different idea.\n\nThat once-small research lab now employs more than 400 people, who have helped transform Nvidia from a video game GPU startup in the nineties to a $4 trillion-dollar company fueling the artificial intelligence boom. Now, the company’s research lab has its sights set on developing the tech needed to power robotics and AI. And some of that lab work is already showing up in products. The company unveiled Monday a new set of world AI models , libraries, and other infrastructure for robotics developers.\n\nWhen Bill Dally joined Nvidia’s research lab in 2009, it employed only about a dozen people and was focused on ray tracing, a rendering technique used in computer graphics.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPhysical AI focus\n\nNow, as Nvidia holds a commanding lead in the AI GPU market, the tech company has started to seek out new areas of demand beyond AI data centers. That search has led Nvidia to physical AI and robotics.\n\n“I think eventually robots are going to be a huge player in the world and we want to basically be making the brains of all the robots,” Dally said. “To do that we need to start developing the key technologies.”\n\nThat’s where Sanja Fidler, the vice president of AI research at Nvidia, comes in. Fidler joined Nvidia’s research lab in 2018. At the time, she was already working on simulation models for robots with a team of students at MIT. When she told Huang about what they were working on at a researchers’ reception, he was interested.\n\n“I could not resist joining,” Fidler told TechCrunch in an interview. “It’s just such a great topic fit and at the same time was also such a great culture fit. Jensen told me, come work with me, not with us, not for us.”\n\nShe joined Nvidia and got to work creating a research lab in Toronto called Omniverse, an Nvidia platform, that was focused on building simulations for physical AI.\n\nSanja Fidler Image Credits:Nvidia\n\nThe first challenge to building these simulated worlds was finding the necessary 3D data, Fidler said. This included finding the proper volume of potential images to use and building the technology needed to turn these images into 3D renditions the simulators could use.\n\n“We invested in this technology called differentiable rendering, which essentially makes rendering amendable to AI,” Fidler said. “You go [from] rendering means from 3D to image or video. And we want it to go the other way.”\n\nWorld models\n\nOmniverse released the first version of its model that turns images into 3D models, GANverse3D, in 2021. Then it got to work on figuring out the same process for video. Fidler said they used videos from robots and self-driving cars to create these 3D models and simulations through its Neural Reconstruction Engine, which the company first announced in 2022.\n\nShe added these technologies were the backbone of the company’s Cosmos family of world AI models that were announced at CES in January.\n\nNow, the lab is focused on making these models faster. When you play a video game or simulation you want the tech to be able to respond in real time, Fidler said, for robots they are working to make the reaction time even faster.\n\n“The robot doesn’t need to watch the world in the same time, in the same way as the world works,” Fidler said. “It can watch it like 100x faster. So if we can make this model significantly faster than they are today, they’re going to be tremendously useful for robotic or physical AI applications.”\n\nThe company continues to make progress on this goal. Nvidia announced at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference on Monday a fleet of new world AI models designed for creating synthetic data that can be used to train robots. Nvidia also announced new libraries and infrastructure software aimed at robotics developers too.\n\nDespite the progress — and the current hype about robots, especially humanoids — the Nvidia research team remains realistic.\n\nBoth Dally and Fidler said the industry is still at least a few years off from having a humanoid in your home, with Fidler comparing it to the hype and timeline regarding autonomous vehicles.\n\n“We’re making huge progress and I think AI has really been the enabler here,” Dally said. “Starting with visual AI for the robot perception, and then generative AI, that’s being hugely valuable for task and motion planning and manipulation. As we solve each of these individual little problems and as the amount of data we have to train our networks grows, these robots are going to grow.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The end of 2022 kicked off the biggest push in AI stocks.\n\nA lagging AI stock now is like the cool kid not getting invited to the biggest party in the neighborhood. Shares of Nvidia from late 2022 are up 1,146%. In fact, the 44 members of the index with trading history going back to at least 2022 are up an average of 306%.\n\nBut do some of these undiscovered AI stocks represent a big opportunity?\n\nGRRR! Gorilla Misses Rally\n\nTaiwan-based Gorilla is the most left-out stock of the bunch. Shares of the AI player are down nearly 80% from the end of 2022. And GRRR stock is off 7% this year.\n\nBut for Gorilla, it's really a case of overenthusiasm at the start spilling over. The company went public in mid-2022, and shares took off immediately. They're just adjusting to reality. In fact, the stock still carries a perfect RS Rating of 99.\n\nPlus, analysts think the company will turn a profit of 75 cents a share this year. Profit is seen growing an additional 49% in 2026.\n\nOthers Left Out, Too\n\nGorilla, though, isn't alone in being shunned from the AI stock party. Shares of Mobileye and Kforce are down 62% and 44%, respectively, from the end of 2022. Both are also down more than 30% just this year.\n\nMobileye sports an RS Rating of just 15. It's a player in the self-driving-car market. And that market is heating up with competition from larger firms like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Mobileye, though, is profitable and growing. Analysts call for a 36% jump in profit this year.\n\nThings aren't as rosy at tech staffing firm Kforce. Ironically, AI is replacing technical jobs. Analysts think profit will fall 22% this year. The stock's RS Rating is just 6.\n\nNot all these AI left-behinds will catch up.

The lockup period for CoreWeave stock tied to the company's initial public offering expires Thursday, earlier than usual.\n\nCoreWeave rents out computer servers equipped with Nvidia (NVDA) chip-equipped servers. Nvidia owns a 7% stake in CoreWeave and is a strategic partner. Microsoft (MSFT) has been CoreWeave's biggest customer.\n\nCoreWeave and other cloud infrastructure startups rent Nvidia-chip equipped computer servers mainly to artificial intelligence model builders as well as app developers. CoreWeave's data centers are designed from scratch for crunching AI workloads.\n\nThere's been some confusion related to the CoreWeave IPO lockup. Lockup periods prevent company insiders from selling stock, usually for 180 days. When the lockups expire, insider selling sometimes pressures a stock.\n\nCoreWeave Stock: IPO Lockup Ends Thursday?\n\nThe company launched its IPO offering and the lockup normally would be around Sept. 24. In CoreWeaves case, though, the lockup will apparently expire two days after it reports earnings for the second time as a public company.\n\n\"The prospectus is clear: it's going to be two days after this week's earnings report,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Nick del Deo told IBD in an email.\n\nA Citigroup report published today said: \"Heading into Q2 earnings for CoreWeave, we reiterate our bullish stance on AI demand and CRWV's ability to outperform near-term topline targets. Though CoreWeave has an expiring lockup that frees up 83% of Class A shares beginning the morning of Aug. 15 we believe strong fundamentals can help absorb the increase in float. Specifically, we see room for another double-digit percentage top-line beat possible in Q2 amid countless signs of inflecting AI demand across the industry.\"\n\nWill Core Scientific Deal Fall Through?\n\nCoreWeave stock has jumped 225% in 2025. But the stock sold off in June after the company announced a deal to acquire Core Scientific (CORZ) in an all-stock deal initially valued at $9 billion. Amid the pullback in CoreWeave stock, some CoreScientific shareholders will reportedly vote against the deal.\n\nCore Scientific also offers data-center infrastructure.\n\nSo the IPO lockup expiration comes at a crucial time. And some Wall Street analysts say it's unclear when the IPO lockup expires.\n\n\"It is unclear,\" Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson told IBD in an email. \"There is some language in the original S1 that leaves it open that they would end the lockup right after reporting the second quarter, but it is ambiguous enough that the date may still be the six month date (Sept. 24).\"\n\nLuria added: \"It is possible that they would do a secondary issuance of locked up shares in order to preempt a lockup up as well. We may get an update on that when they report Tuesday.\"\n\nCoreWeave Stock: JPMorgan Hikes Price Target\n\nCoreWeave operates 33 data centers in the U.S. and Europe. Also, CoreWeave has preferred access to Nvidia's graphic processing units. Its cloud offerings are optimized for training and inference required to perform AI tasks.\n\nFor the June quarter, analysts estimate an adjusted loss of 23 cents per share for CoreWeave stock on revenue of $1.082 billion.\n\n\"We see a high likelihood of a strong beat versus guidance and consensus, but a more difficult path when it comes to outperforming lofty investor expectations, keeping us equal-weight,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a Q2 earnings preview. He added: \"We still see near-term downside to the shares given the upcoming (Aug.14) lock-up expiration which will materially increase float for the stock.\"\n\nJPMorgan on Monday raised its price target on CoreWeave stock to 135.\n\n\"Heading into CoreWeave's June quarter earnings results next week, the central theme is the ongoing shortage in global AI capacity coupled with the huge ramp in demand to continually push frontier models forward,\" said JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy in a report. \"While the long-term AI ramp trend is clear, the exact timing of CoreWeave's large slugs of bookings and sequencing of infrastructure build-outs naturally carry uncertainty quarter-to-quarter, and may pose ongoing extreme volatility in CRWV shares: caveat emptor.\"\n\nCoreWeave Technical Rating\n\nHe added: \"However, although timing and lumpiness still give us pause and create extreme volatility, we are positive on the potential for continued momentum in CoreWeave's business pipeline, and our field work suggests long-range potential for binary-outcome transactions which are very difficult to handicap and, if successful, can drive a very surprising magnitude of outsized growth and outsized debt financing with short-term cash burn.\"\n\nMeanwhile, CoreWeave stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A-minus. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. (A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling.

Plenty of other companies are using AI to great effect, but they don't get the same level of attention.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM -0.80%) is killing it in AI, and it's a real shame many investors haven't caught on. IBM's AI strategy is focused on providing solutions to its enterprise clients. The company isn't plowing mountains of capital into AI data centers, and it isn't splurging on training industry-leading models. Instead, through a mix of consulting services, software, and hardware, IBM is emerging as a leader in enterprise AI.\n\n$7.5 billion and counting\n\nSince IBM kicked off its generative AI strategy, the company has booked more than $7.5 billion worth of business. Around 80% of this total comes from the consulting business, with the rest coming from software. Playing a supporting role is hardware, namely IBM's decades-old mainframe business.\n\nIBM's consulting-forward strategy works because enterprise clients need more than software. IBM's watsonx platform provides the software tools necessary for clients to develop, fine-tune, deploy, and govern AI agents and applications, but implementation services and other offerings from the consulting business are equally important. A client who uses AWS and Azure for cloud computing may want to deploy watsonx on those platforms, for example, requiring a complex solution that IBM can provide.\n\nIBM does train its own AI models, but the focus is on speed, safety, and cost. IBM's Granite family of models are designed to be fine-tunable for specific tasks. They're open source, perform well in safety benchmarks, and are cost-effective for businesses. In terms of performance, Granite beats competing AI models of similar complexity in a variety of benchmarks.\n\nIBM's mainframe business shouldn't be ignored. Major industries including financial services still depend heavily on IBM's mainframe systems, and the latest z17 model brings some serious AI firepower. The z17 is designed for more than 250 distinct AI use cases, ranging from loan risk mitigation to medical image analysis, and it can handle 450 billion AI inferencing operations per day with response times of one millisecond. For enterprises needing real-time AI inferencing and rock-solid reliability, IBM's mainframes continue to be the best option.\n\nImportantly, IBM's AI strategy doesn't depend on AI technology making exponential gains in capabilities, or on ever-increasing AI infrastructure investments. Because IBM is focusing on delivering AI solutions that help companies reduce costs or boost efficiency, demand should hold up even if the AI frenzy cools off. As it stands today, AI is incredibly useful for businesses, and IBM is playing a critical role in enabling enterprises to tap into the technology.\n\nSurging free cash flow\n\nAfter a decade of uninspiring results and inconsistent revenue growth, IBM has settled into a groove. The company has shed slow-growing businesses and bet on its hybrid cloud computing and AI platforms. Revenue is not only growing again but accelerating, and profits are improving.\n\nFor 2025, IBM expects revenue at constant currency to grow by at least 5%. That may not seem all that quick, but IBM is still a sprawling company with numerous product and service offerings, and it's currently facing a slowdown in demand for discretionary tech projects. Some parts of IBM are growing slowly, and some, like AI, are growing much faster.\n\nIBM also expects to generate more than $13.5 billion in free cash flow this year, up from $12.7 billion in 2024. That's solid growth, particularly given the unpredictable economic developments so far in 2025. Strong growth for IBM's high-margin software business, its largest segment, is helping the cause. Software revenue grew by 8% in the second quarter and managed a segment operating profit margin of 31.1%.\n\nWith solid profits, a return to reliable revenue growth, and an AI strategy that's working well with its enterprise client base, IBM is an AI stock that all investors should seriously consider.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:49:12.803364+00:00"}

It's not like dividend stocks completely faltered during that stretch, though. Many performed pretty well during that period, too, as evidenced by the performance of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG 0.97%) over the course of the past five years.\n\nThen and now\n\nThe graphic below tells the tale. Had you invested $1,000 in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation fund in August of 2020, today you'd have $1,640 plus all the dividends it paid in the meantime. And if you'd reinvested those dividend payments in more shares of VIG, your $1,000 investment would be worth $1,800 now.\n\nThe dividend payments for this exchange-traded fund (ETF) have also grown during this time. July's quarterly payment of $0.87 per share is well above the same quarter's payment of only $0.60 in 2020, in line with this fund's actual dividend growth during this five-year period.\n\nNot the best ETF for dividend income\n\nIn this vein, you should know that while this Vanguard fund prioritizes reliable dividend growth over high yields or capital appreciation, Vanguard Dividend Appreciation also offers the latter at least as well as most other dividend-oriented ETFs. Only the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM 1.14%) has fared better for the past five years, and only by a slight margin.\n\nCredit a quirk of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF's underlying S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, mostly. It excludes the highest-yielding one-fourth of tickers that would otherwise be eligible for inclusion in the index. Standard & Poor's fears these high yields suggest their particular companies may be facing growth headwinds.\n\nRemoving these highest-yielding names from the mix, of course, also dials back this ETF's average dividend yield. VIG's trailing yield right now is a little less than 1.7%, which isn't much for anyone looking for above-average investment income.

Should you buy it now?\n\nInitial public offerings (IPOs) are known for being volatile, but CoreWeave (CRWV 5.70%) has taken that to an extreme.\n\nThe generative AI-focused cloud infrastructure provider limped into its IPO, undersubscribed and priced for less than its target at $40. In fact, Nvidia had to come in and help bail out CoreWeave's IPO.\n\nAfter initially heading lower following the IPO in March, CoreWeave started to soar in May along with the broad market, before peaking in June with a gain of more than 300%. Since then, the stock has fallen by more than a third from its peak on concerns about valuation and the company's business model.\n\nCoreWeave has turned into a classic battleground stock with big bets on both sides. Ahead of CoreWeave's second-quarter earnings report after hours on Aug. 12, should investors buy shares? Let's take a look at the buy, sell, and hold arguments for CoreWeave.\n\nBuy CoreWeave\n\nThe most obvious reason to buy CoreWeave is the company's stratospheric growth rate, which shows how fast demand is growing for AI computing power.\n\nRevenue in the quarter jumped 420% to $981.6 million. It's unclear how big CoreWeave can get, but its growth rate holds a lot of promise.\n\nWhile legacy cloud infrastructure companies like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are posting strong growth, CoreWeave's peer Nebius jumped on its second-quarter earnings report, a promising sign for CoreWeave's report. Nebius' revenue growth accelerated in the second quarter, improving to 625% as revenue reached $105.1 million.\n\nRecent news items also indicate that CoreWeave remains on a hypergrowth path. In recent weeks, the company closed a $1.75 billion debt offering and a $2.6 billion debt facility, giving it more financial flexibility as it builds out new data centers. The company also announced plans to invest up to $6 billion in a new state-of-the-art data center in Pennsylvania.\n\nCoreWeave received backing from Nvidia, and its customers are some of the most powerful companies in AI, like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet, which should support the company's growth.\n\nSell CoreWeave\n\nEven CoreWeave bulls have to admit that the stock is very risky. CoreWeave is unprofitable and its business model is unproven. While the company's operating losses seem tolerable at $27.5 million, it's taken a lot of high-interest debt to fund its expansion, which will make it difficult to turn a profit on the bottom line. In the first quarter, it had $263.8 million in interest expense on nearly $9 billion in debt.\n\nCritics have also said that CoreWeave's business model requires refreshing its data centers with new and up-to-date GPUs, which means the company could struggle to get out of debt.\n\nThe 9% rate for its newest debt shows that lenders are treating the company like a low-credit buyer.\n\nHold CoreWeave\n\nThere's been a lot of noise in the macro environment this year around trade policy and issues specific to the semiconductor industry like China export restrictions.\n\nIt's also difficult to assess CoreWeave's valuation when the stock is growing this fast but also losing a ton of money. The volatility in the stock further adds to the difficulty.\n\nInvestors may want to wait a few more months to see if CoreWeave can reach equilibrium and if its prospects are clearer after a couple more earnings reports.\n\nWhat's the verdict?\n\nGiven the volatility in the stock, holding CoreWeave seems to make the most sense here. The stock could soar after its earnings report Tuesday night, but investors are also likely to get a pullback in the coming months, given its recent volatility and high valuation.\n\nOver the long term, CoreWeave still has a lot of upside potential if it can maintain its triple-digit growth rate and trim its losses, so it shouldn't hurt to be patient.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:49:19.874550+00:00"}

Telling Coca-Cola how to make Coke and Fed Chair Jerome Powell how to make monetary policy. Overseeing the curriculum and anti-antisemitism rules of some of the world’s best universities. Deciding which industries the United States needs to repatriate from Canada and elsewhere. Choosing double-digit tariff rates for trading partners seemingly on a whim. Drawing new borders for Ukraine. Turning Gaza into a resort. Asking Intel to fire its CEO because he’s supposedly too close to China. Skimming 15 per cent off the top of Nvidia Corp. chips sold to that same China under restored export licences. Musing about who should be mayor of New York and running the District of Columbia all on his own.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal’s Holman Jenkins, Jr., figures Trump will soon weigh in on the NFL’s purchase of a 10 per cent interest in ESPN. And why not? It’s in the news. This president apparently feels that if something is in the news, he has a stake in it. Every news cycle — and they’re down to about 90 minutes each now — brings something Trump.\n\nEven we who disagree with much of what Trump does and all of how he does it have to admire the energy of this 79-year-old dynamo. A new study suggests, however, that a little less presidential energy and a lot more forbearance might be better for the U.S. economy.\n\nThe study is by Christopher Blattman and Scott Gehlbach of the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy and Zeyang Yu of Princeton’s politics department. The three take up the age-old question of whether democracies out-perform autocracies in terms of economic growth. They find that the data (on more than 150 countries from 1960 to 2010) suggest democracies don’t actually produce a growth premium — though since economics isn’t everything and freedom isn’t explicitly priced in the national accounts, that doesn’t mean we should be indifferent to whether we live in one or not.\n\nBut, the researchers found, some autocracies do produce systematically inferior economic outcomes. In particular, those dominated by strong personalities — the likes of Saddam Hussein, Mobutu Sese Seko, Nicolás Maduro and Vladimir Putin — do more poorly, even after controlling for the fact that “personalist” autocrats may be more likely to emerge in countries already experiencing economic difficulty.\n\nThe raw difference in annual growth rates between democracies and “institutionalized” autocracies, on the one hand, and personalist autocracies, on the other, is about a percentage point. That may not sound like much. But, as the authors point out, compound one per cent economic growth over 50 years and you’re talking two-thirds higher income.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:49:25.871847+00:00"}

While GPT-5 is great for OpenAI's early backers, I see its creation as a massive -- albeit overlooked -- win for Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) investors.\n\nLet's explore why GPT-5 is a big deal as the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative continues to unfold, and assess why Nvidia stock is positioned to benefit from the rise of more sophisticated LLMs.\n\nGPT-5 is more than just a new chatbot; it's rewriting the playbook for enterprise AI\n\nGPT-5 does not represent a routine upgrade compared to prior models released by OpenAI. Rather, large corporate enterprises are demanding more advanced functionality across a host of use cases and applications from LLMs.\n\nNew models such as GPT-5 doesn't simply mean \"smarter\" chatbots. Rather, GPT-5 and the competition that it spurs will open the door to a host of new applications in agentic AI, healthcare, and even adjacent models that lead to breakthroughs in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and wearable tech.\n\nConsidering OpenAI reportedly already has millions of paying customers and is on track to generate $20 billion in annual recurring revenue this year, I suspect the release of GPT-5 will serve as a bellwether for even more accelerated AI adoption.\n\nHow is GPT-5 bullish for Nvidia?\n\nIn a recent article by my fellow Fool Danny Vena, he made an astute point that AI adoption is moving downstream -- an idea that I don't think most investors fully grasp yet.\n\nEach new generation of an AI software model such as GPT innately leads to more demand for training and inferencing hardware. These developments require significant computational power in the form of GPU clusters, which plays right into Nvidia's rolodex of industry-leading AI accelerators, networking equipment, and CUDA software stack.\n\nTaking this one step further, the release of GPT-5 now raises the stakes for rival LLM platforms like Anthropic, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity -- ultimately creating an intensified arms race for complex GPU architectures, such as Nvidia Blackwell.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy right now?\n\nThe chart below illustrates trends in Nvidia's forward price to earnings (P/E) multiple over the last three years. Although Nvidia's forward P/E ratio is both higher than the three-year average and clearly experiencing an expansion phase at the moment, the valuation multiple does remain at a steep discount to prior levels seen during the AI revolution.\n\nI think Nvidia's premium forward earnings multiple suggests that investors are generally bullish on the company's prospects.\n\nHowever, the discount to historical levels could suggest that investors may not fully appreciate how rising AI infrastructure investment will translate into meaningful and accretive gains across Nvidia's ecosystem.\n\nMore advanced applications will continue to drive demand for Nvidia's full stack as the company plays a critical dual role in powering the creation and ongoing development of AI models across hardware and software.

I called some CEOs yesterday to get their thoughts on Nvidia and AMD’s deal to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of AI chip sales to China to secure export licenses. Most were surprisingly sanguine about the unusual arrangement.\n\nCorey duBrowa, who is global CEO of communications giant Burson, described the deal as “another novel approach that’s being implemented by the Trump administration as they continue to rewrite trade norms and practices.”\n\nA veteran leader in the manufacturing space described the deal as proof of Trump’s commitment to American manufacturing, adding that the cost was likely worth it. Another U.S.-based CEO called it “brilliant, a tariff that we don’t have to pay.”\n\nBut some also raised questions:\n\nWhat does this mean for national security? Such restrictions are designed to address national security concerns, not raise revenue. Governments typically only make money when penalizing those who break the rules. Could financial incentives put security priorities on hold? Allies are historically able to buy military equipment and sensitive technologies that others are not. Could this further erode trust?\n\nHow will this impact trade deals? Many CEOs believe tariffs are here to stay, as America’s trading partners create their own walled fortresses and blocs.\n\nWhere will the money go? Export fees and tariffs mean higher costs for U.S. consumers and companies, and higher revenue for the government. Tariffs alone are expected to bring in $50 billion a month. The Nvidia/AMD deals could add another $4 billion to Treasury coffers next year. Will that be used to pay down debt, help consumers, or be spent some other way?\n\n\n\nContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:49:33.865508+00:00"}

Once in a while, something of importance can fall through the cracks.\n\nFor example, the sheer abundance of Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission might go unnoticed by investors. A 13F is a required filing no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management. It provides a snapshot for investors of which stocks Wall Street's smartest fund managers are buying and selling.\n\nWhile there's no substitute to quarterly earnings reports, knowing which stocks and trends Wall Street's leading asset managers are buying into or selling out of is equally valuable.\n\nBeyond Warren Buffett, Appaloosa's billionaire chief David Tepper tends to be one of the most-followed fund managers. Tepper's willingness to dive into popular growth stocks has resonated with investors during the current bull market.\n\nHowever, Tepper's trading activity over the previous year (April 1, 2024–March 31, 2025) has been eyebrow-raising, to say the least. Based on 13Fs, he's been a persistent seller of two of Wall Street's most-popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%). At the same time, he's chosen to buy shares of a cutting-edge company whose total addressable market is estimated at $205 billion.\n\nTepper shows AI hardware stocks to the door\n\nOver a 12-month period ended March 31, Tepper and his team completely exited 14 holdings and reduced Appaloosa's stake in 19 other positions. Among these moves, the two most noteworthy are:\n\nNvidia : 4,120,000 shares sold, representing a 93% reduction (note: this accounts for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024).\n\n: 4,120,000 shares sold, representing a 93% reduction (note: this accounts for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024). Advanced Micro Devices: 1,630,000 shares sold, representing a complete exit from this position.\n\nOn paper, everything would seem to be going great for these developers of graphics processing unit (GPUs). Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell GPUs hold a majority of AI-accelerated data center market share, while AMD's Instinct series chips are ramping up and aiming to siphon away market share from Nvidia. For more than two years, businesses have been spending aggressively on AI-data center infrastructure to gain first-mover advantages over their peers.\n\nNvidia has been particularly adept at growing its sales and keeping customers loyal thanks to its CUDA software platform. CUDA is what developers use to maximize the computing potential of their Nvidia GPUs, as well as to train large language models.\n\nHowever, David Tepper's selling activity in AI hardware stocks was likely undertaken with a purpose.\n\nOne possibility is that Tepper and his team were (pardon the pun) taking their chips off the table after a sizable run-up in the shares of both Nvidia and AMD. The average holding period for Appaloosa's securities is two years and five months, which suggests Tepper isn't shy about locking in gains when presented with the opportunity to do so. The concern is there may be more to this story than just profit-taking.\n\nArguably the biggest worry with the AI revolution is that it'll follow historical precedent. For more than three decades, every game-changing technology has worked its way through an early stage bubble that eventually burst. Put another way, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology would earn wide adoption and become useful. It takes time for next-big-thing innovations to mature, and artificial intelligence doesn't look as if it'll be the exception.\n\nIf an AI bubble were to form and burst, AI hardware stocks like Nvidia and AMD would undoubtedly feel the pinch.\n\nCompetitive pressures are also a concern (more so for Nvidia than AMD). Though most eyes tend to be on external competitors developing AI-GPUs, internal competition is possibly an even bigger story.\n\nMany of Wall Street's most-influential companies are internally developing AI chips to use in their data centers. Even though this hardware can't compete with Nvidia and/or AMD on a compute basis, it'll be considerably cheaper and more readily available. In other words, it's a recipe for less AI-GPU scarcity, weaker pricing power, and lower gross margin for Nvidia and AMD.\n\nThis fintech goliath has Tepper's undivided attention\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Tepper added 10 new stocks to Appaloosa's nearly $8.4 billion investment portfolio over the last year (excluding options). Arguably one of the more attractive additions is that of fintech juggernaut Block (XYZ 2.00%).\n\nDuring the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tepper's fund held in excess of 400,000 shares of Block. But by the end of the first quarter of 2021, every share had been sent to the chopping block. Following a four-year hiatus, Block stock is back in Appaloosa's investment portfolio, with Tepper adding 75,000 shares during the March-ended quarter.\n\nBlock has two distinct operating segments -- Square ecosystem and Cash App -- each of which brings a sizable addressable market to the table.\n\nThe Square ecosystem is Block's foundational operating division, with this segment sporting an estimated addressable market of $130 billion, based on a research note released in November 2024 by Piper Sandler analyst Arvind Ramnani.\n\nSquare is the merchant-focused portion of Block's business that's designed to facilitate digital/mobile payments, as well as provide merchants with payment solutions and data analytics. During the fourth quarter of 2020, gross payment volume (GPV) totaled $29.4 billion for the Square ecosystem. But as of the second quarter of 2025, GPV topped $64.2 billion.\n\nThe rapid expansion in GPV on Square's payment networks is a function of sustained double-digit growth in international markets, as well as a higher percentage of GPV originating from larger businesses (those with $500,000 or more in annual GPV).\n\nThe other key puzzle piece for Block is its mobile payment service known as Cash App. Ramnani views Cash App as being a $75 billion addressable opportunity for Block. When combined with the Square ecosystem, Block is staring down an estimated $205 billion tailwind.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Cash App had 36 million monthly active customers. But as of the midpoint of 2025, there are now 57 million monthly transacting active users. Cash App is a higher margin opportunity for Block than the Square ecosystem, with gross profit per Cash App user often heavily outpacing the cost to acquire Cash App actives.\n\nThough both of Block's operating segments are more than a decade old, they're arguably still early in their respective expansions. Even with competition picking up in the digital payments arena, Block appears well-positioned to capitalize on a sustained double-digit growth opportunity.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:49:35.349231+00:00"}

The arrangement looks like an export tax, which is forbidden by the US Constitution.\n\nThe Trump administration is already in the midst of a lawsuit related to his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy what he called “reciprocal” tariffs on the world. On Friday, Trump warned of a “GREAT DEPRESSION” if US courts ruled that his tariffs were illegal.\n\nChips are at the heart of the US-China battle to dominate industries of the future such as AI and automation. The Biden administration restricted the sale of advanced chips to China, prompting Nvidia to develop the H20 to comply with those restrictions. Trump administration officials tightened export controls in April by barring Nvidia from selling the chips without a permit.\n\nLast month, however, the White House decided to allow Nvidia and AMD to resume sales of chips designed specifically for the Chinese market, which are several rungs below the most advanced artificial intelligence accelerators. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the administration wanted Chinese developers “addicted” to American technology.\n\nChina has grown increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese firms deploying the H20, particularly after the US called for the chips to be installed with tracking technology to better enforce export controls. Yuyuantantian, a social media account affiliated with state-run China Central Television that regularly signals Beijing’s thinking about trade, on Sunday slammed the chip’s supposed security vulnerabilities and inefficiency.\n\nStill, Chinese companies could use the H20s because domestic firms can’t produce enough AI chips to meet demand. That potentially provides an opportunity for Nvidia and AMD to sell more — and now for the US government to earn additional revenue as well.\n\nTrump extended a pause of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days into early November, stabilizing trade ties between the world’s two largest economies.\n\n“There’s clearly a shift by the administration to take a lighter national security stance as these negotiations are ongoing,” said Drew DeLong, lead in geopolitical dynamics practice at Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm.\n\nChina Draws Red Lines on US Chip Tracking With Nvidia Meeting\n\nWhile the US has intervened before, including by taking stakes in private companies after the 2008 financial crisis, a similar deal like the one struck with Nvidia and AMD is hard to remember and — without proper oversight — could lead to a “crony capitalism state,” according to Scott Kennedy, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n“It represents a huge shift in the way the American economy is supposed to operate,” Kennedy said. “It won’t make anyone happy except maybe the Chinese, who will get their chips and watch the US political system go through gyration and domestic tensions.”\n\n(Updates to include reference to Blackwell chip sales in sixth and seventh paragraphs, extention of trade truce in 16th.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:49:44.850229+00:00"}

How Will Its Revenue and Profits Be Impacted?", "summary": "Nvidia's H20 AI chip situation is not ideal, but it's significantly better than having no H20 sales.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/11/nvda-stock-china-ai-chips/", "published_at": "2025-08-12T01:00:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Nvidia's H20 AI chip situation is not ideal, but it's significantly better than having no H20 sales.\n\nNvidia (NVDA 0.58%) and fellow graphics processing unit (GPU) maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from sales of their respective artificial intelligence (AI) data center chips designed for the China market in exchange for obtaining export licenses for these chips, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the story on Sunday night.\n\nThe 15% AI chip revenue deal\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department began issuing export licenses for Nvidia's H20 chip and AMD's MI308 chip on Friday, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Friday.\n\nNvidia provided a statement to the FT after it broke the government deal story on Sunday night that included the following: \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.\"\n\nBackground on Nvidia's H20 chip\n\nNvidia had designed the H20 AI-enabling GPU specifically for the Chinese market after earlier U.S. export controls, enacted under the administration of President Joe Biden, meant it couldn't sell its more advanced data center AI chips to China.\n\nIn mid-April, the Trump administration expanded the restrictions to include the H20. Nvidia immediately halted its sales and took a charge of $4.5 billion on its Q1 results for H20 inventory and purchase commitments.\n\nThen in mid-July, Nvidia emailed investors who subscribe to the company's news and said it was \"filing applications to sell the Nvidia H20 GPU again. The U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon.\"\n\nAt the time, there was no mention of giving the government a 15% cut of H20 revenue as a condition for obtaining export licenses.\n\nHow will Nvidia's revenue be affected by this deal?\n\nWe can get an estimate as to how this deal will affect Nvidia's financial results by looking at the company's fiscal first quarter, which ended on April 27.\n\nIn that quarter, Nvidia sold $4.6 billion in H20 chips to China prior to the start of the export controls in mid-April. It said it was unable to ship $2.5 billion in H20 chips that it had already produced due to the export controls. So, had the restrictions not existed, Nvidia would have sold $7.1 billion in H20 chips to China customers in Q1. This amounts to 15.2% of $46.6 billion, which is what its total revenue would have been, absent the export controls.\n\nOver 15% of its total revenue is significant, so you can see the importance of Nvidia's China data center business.\n\nFor its fiscal Q2 (which ended July 27), investors should expect Nvidia to report no sales of its H20 chip, because the export restrictions were in place the entire quarter. However, H20 sales should fully rebound in fiscal Q3 (late July to late October).\n\nWhen Nvidia provided Q2 guidance, it estimated that it would lose about $8 billion in H20 chip sales due to the export controls. So, keeping with roughly the same sequential quarter growth, let's assume Q3 H20 sales will be about $9 billion. In this case, Nvidia would pay the U.S. government $1.35 billion, which is 15% of $9 billion.\n\nWhile $1.35 billion seems like a huge number, it's only a small percentage of Nvidia's overall quarterly revenue. In Q1, Nvidia's total revenue was $44.1 billion -- and it would have been $46.6 billion, had it not \"lost\" sales of $2.5 billion due to the export restrictions. That $1.35 billion is only 2.9% of $46.6 billion. But the actual Q3 percentage will be smaller because Nvidia's revenue will be higher in Q3 than Q1.\n\nA revenue loss of somewhere between 2% to 3% of total sales is a very minor speed bump. Moreover, it's a much better situation than having no H20 sales.\n\nHow will Nvidia's profitability be affected by this deal?\n\nGiving the government a 15% cut of H20 sales revenue should also negatively affect Nvidia's bottom line. But it should be an extremely minor dent, because Nvidia's data center platform is amazingly profitable. On that note, Nvidia overall is amazingly profitable.\n\nNvidia doesn't break out its profitability by platform, so we'll have to use its overall numbers. In Q1, Nvidia's adjusted gross margin (gross profit divided by revenue) absent the $4.5 billion H20-related charge was 71.3%. The company provided its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) absent the charge, so I could calculate adjusted net income absent the charge and then from that calculate adjusted net profit margin (net income divided by revenue) absent the charge -- which would have been 56.1%.\n\nIn other words, Nvidia converts more than half of its revenue into adjusted profits in a typical quarter, which is just phenomenal. It can easily absorb slightly less profitability on its H20 chips, which, again, account for roughly 15% of its total revenue in a typical quarter.\n\nIn short, Nvidia stock's strong upward trajectory should not be hurt by the company having to give the government a slice of its H20 sales.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:49:49.096310+00:00"}

A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.\n\nThe arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees, according to shipping giant Maersk.\n\nIn a Monday press conference, President Trump described the agreement with Nvidia as a deal that would benefit the nation. He described meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of agreeing to the export license; Mr. Trump didn't mention AMD in his comments.\n\n\"So I said, 'I want 20% if I'm going to approve it for you,'\" Mr. Trump said of his meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of the export license. \"I don't want it myself, so when I say I want 20%, it's for the country.\"\n\n\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.\n\nThe revenue-sharing plan comes after the White House announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and MI308 chips from rival chipmaker AMD to China. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month said it had won approval from the Trump administration to sell its H20 chips to China.\n\nThe H20 chip, which is specialized for artificial intelligence applications, was developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market, while AMD's MI308 chips are also geared for AI.\n\nIt is unclear how the Trump administration would use the money generated from the chip sales agreement.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on the specifics of the deal.

Many growth stocks have made investors much richer, though not every growth stock will turn out to be a winner.\n\nHere are four growth stocks to consider, each of which has a promising future and a reasonable recent valuation. See which one(s) are a good fit for your long-term portfolio.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt's hard not to notice Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) these days, as it has posted boffo gains over many years. Over the past 15 years, it has grown at an average annual rate of 56.1%, enough to turn $1,000 into more than $790,000! Over the past three years, it has averaged annual gains of 116.5%.\n\nBetter still, it's not even seeming overvalued at recent levels, with a forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 41, roughly on par with its five-year average of 39. Nvidia has plenty of growth potential left, as it's become a key supplier of semiconductor chips for data centers (used heavily for artificial intelligence (AI) computing, among other things. Indeed, Nvidia's data center business has exploded from $3 billion to $115 billion in annual revenue over just five years, with more growth expected.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nLike Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is among the \"Magnificent Seven\" fast-growing giants. Alphabet is home to not only the dominant Google search engine, but also the YouTube video platform, the Chrome browser, the Nest suite of smart home products, the Android operating system, the Google Cloud Platform, and more.\n\nAlphabet has become a leader in (AI), as well, incorporating it into offerings such as search. It's also a major player in cloud computing, with its Google Cloud. It has become a dividend-paying stock now, having initiated a payout in 2024 and recently increasing it by 5%.\n\nSome worry about Alphabet being broken up due to antitrust concerns, but that's not necessarily bad for shareholders, who may end up owning all the pieces, which could be worth more separately. Meanwhile, the stock's valuation is attractive, with its recent forward P/E of 20, below the five-year average of 22.\n\n3. Waste Management\n\nWaste Management (WM -1.71%) is a growth stock? A trash collection and recycling specialist? Yup, it is. Consider this: Over the past 15 years, it has averaged annual gains of 14.4% -- and over the past five years and 10 years, it has averaged more than 17%.\n\nWaste Management should be appealing if you're at all worried about an economic slowdown or recession, as its business is fairly recession-resistant. People might put off going on vacation or buying a new refrigerator when they're financially stressed, but garbage collection will go on.\n\nWith a recent forward P/E of 30, a bit above the five-year average of 27, Waste Management's stock seems only slightly overvalued. It's not easy to catch the shares when they're undervalued, so if you're a long-term believer, you might want to consider buying a few shares.\n\nAnother plus for the company is its dividend yield, recently 1.4%. That may not seem like a lot, but it's been growing briskly. The total annual payout was recently $3.15, up from $2.18 in 2020 and $1.54 in 2015. Waste Management offers both growth and income.\n\n4. Vanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nFinally, there's the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 1.55%). It's technically not a common stock; it's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) -- a fund that trades like a stock. So you can buy shares of it from any good brokerage. This ETF will instantly have you invested in more than 300 stocks, each of which is in some way a tech stock. Its top holdings include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Palantir Technologies.\n\nHere's why I'm suggesting you consider it as a growth stock: Over the past five years, it has averaged annual gains of 18.4%. Over the past decade and the past 15 years, its average annual gains have been 21.5% and 19.6%, respectively. This is one high-performance ETF.\n\nSo, give any or all of these suggestions some consideration for your long-term portfolio. Do keep in mind, though, that should the market suffer a pullback (as happens every now and then), growth stocks will often pull back more sharply than their value-stock counterparts. If you can't handle some volatility, think twice before focusing on growth stocks.\n\nAnd remember that for some or all of your long-term dollars, you can do quite well just sticking with a simple S&P 500 index fund, too.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:49:55.854696+00:00"}

Twenty years ago, the largest companies in the land hailed from the oil and industrial industries. For example, in 2005, the largest companies in the U.S., measured by market cap, were ExxonMobil and General Electric, worth $392 billion and $375 billion, respectively. Now, two decades later, technology enterprises, particularly those involved in artificial intelligence (AI), are at the top of the charts.\n\nThree of the world's most recognizable companies are at the forefront. AI chipmaker Nvidia leads the field at $4.3 trillion, within striking distance of a new all-time high. Software and cloud purveyor Microsoft also appears poised to climb to new heights, recently climbing to $3.9 trillion. Rounding out this tech trifecta is iPhone maker Apple at $3.1 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of $2.3 trillion, it might seem a bit premature to predict Amazon's (AMZN 0.08%) admission. After all, fair-weather investors have fled, and the stock is flat so far this year, weighed down by tariff-related uncertainty. However, other segments of Amazon's business appear poised to spark a renaissance in the company's growth, securing its membership in the $3 trillion club.\n\nThe tariff conundrum\n\nThe Trump administration's tariff policies remain in flux, and the resulting uncertainty is weighing on Amazon's stock. That's easy to understand, as third-party merchants generate roughly 62% of unit sales, and many of these goods are sourced from China. A recent deal set a minimum levy of 30% on Chinese imports, while some products are saddled with a higher rate. The recent trade agreement notwithstanding, investors are wary of the ongoing impact on Amazon's e-commerce sales.\n\nResults from the second quarter and Amazon's forecast seemed to confirm their worst fears. Overall net sales increased 13% year over year to $167.7 billion, with 61% of its revenue from digital sales or third-party seller services. The company's third-quarter outlook is telling. While Amazon is forecasting revenue growth of 11.5% at the midpoint of its guidance, it expects operating income to be essentially flat, in no small part thanks to tariffs.\n\nPartly cloudy\n\nThe good news is that its cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), won't be directly affected by tariffs. For context, AWS generated 19% of Amazon's revenue and 58% of operating income so far this year, helping insulate the company somewhat from tariffs.\n\nFurthermore, AWS is the worldwide leader in cloud infrastructure services, with a market share of 32% in Q1, according to market analyst Canalys. Furthermore, the segment is growing at a respectable pace, with sales of $31 billion representing a roughly 18% increase.\n\nGrowth has reaccelerated over the past year, driven by rising demand for AI. In June, CEO Andy Jassy pulled back the curtain, revealing that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and apps in development or already built, and the company plans to create many more. \"AI will be a substantial catalyst,\" Jassy said.\n\nAmazon's cloud customers represent a captive audience and target market for its AI products and services, which will be a catalyst for future growth.\n\nA distinct \"ad\"vantage\n\nAnother area fueling Amazon's growth is advertising, which is by far the company's fastest-growing segment. Ad revenue grew 23% year over year to $15.7 billion in Q2, and now accounts for more than 9% of total revenue. Its growth has expanded beyond in-search advertising, driven by Amazon Prime, live sports programming, Fire TV, and Twitch -- the company's live-streaming gaming platform.\n\nAmazon also recently inked deals with Roku and Disney to drive future growth. The company now reaches more than 80% of connected TV (CTV) households in the U.S., significantly expanding the reach of its advertising.\n\nThe path to $3 trillion\n\nAmazon has a market cap of roughly $2.32 trillion as of this writing, so it will only take a stock price increase of about 29% to boost its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $708 billion in 2025, resulting in a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would need revenue of roughly $914 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting Amazon's growth to be roughly 10% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that target, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2028. That might well be conservative, as Amazon has grown its annual revenue by 561% over the past decade, and by 13% in the most recent quarter, fueled by demand for cloud and AI services.\n\nFurthermore, at 33 times earnings, Amazon trades at a slight premium compared with a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500 -- yet has generated stock price gains of 719% over the past 10 years, far exceeding the S&P 500, which rose just 202%. This makes a compelling case that Amazon stock is attractive at this price.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:49:57.242779+00:00"}

This move cemented Nvidia's position as the world's most valuable company, beating out other tech heavyweights, including Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia has become the poster child for the accelerating adoption of AI, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) underpin the technology.\n\nAnother big development helped propel the stock higher. In a blog post published on July 14, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the company would resume sales of H20 chips to customers in China after a three-month moratorium. After the ban was issued in early April, Nvidia had taken a $4.5 billion charge related to these H20 chips. The charge combined with the $4.6 billion in quarterly sales that had already occurred suggested there was more than $9 billion in quarterly revenue at stake.\n\nIn the wake of this announcement, several Wall Street analysts issued bullish takes on the chipmaker, citing the resumption of sales in this important market.\n\nMore to come\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report the results of its fiscal 2026 second quarter after the market close on Aug. 27, and investors are likely in for a pleasant surprise. Management was guiding for revenue of about $45 billion, which would represent growth of 50%, but that was before the company resumed chip sales to China. Nvidia had a limited supply of its H20 chips in stock, so the full impact of the easing of import restrictions likely won't be felt until Q3. Furthermore, Nvidia has a history of issuing conservative guidance, so the results will likely be higher than its forecast.\n\nFinally, Nvidia controls about 90% of the data center GPU market, and spending by big tech on capital expenditure (capex) to support AI continues at a brisk pace. At the same time, Nvidia is selling for just 31 times next year's earnings, an attractive price for a company with so much opportunity.\n\nThat's why Nvidia stock is a buy.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:50:08.208915+00:00"}

The chips Nvidia's H20 AI accelerator and AMD's MI308 were previously restricted under export controls and now require special licenses. The agreement has raised eyebrows among trade experts, who see it as an unusual way to monetize export policy and warn it could face legal challenges under constitutional limits on export taxes. While the administration recently allowed the sale of these lower-spec AI chips to the Chinese market, the model could open the door to similar deals in other industries, creating a new layer of political and regulatory risk.\n\nThe development fits into a broader pattern of transactional trade policy since President Donald Trump returned to office, blending tariffs, investment pledges, and high-profile deals with national security provisions. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been open about the goal of keeping Chinese developers tied to US technology, even as Beijing criticizes the H20's performance and security safeguards. Despite the pushback, limited domestic chip supply could keep Chinese firms in the market, offering Nvidia and AMD both an opportunity and an added cost structure. The current 90-day trade truce between the US and China is set to expire on August 12, though officials have signaled it may be extended as talks continue.\n\nAnalysts note that the Nvidia and AMD framework could quickly become a template for other targeted sectors, particularly if the White House sees it as a tool to extract revenue while maintaining market access. Legal questions remain, and a separate court challenge is already underway over the administration's use of emergency powers to impose reciprocal tariffs.

NVDA and AMD edged lower Monday.\n\nThe AI chipmakers agreed to this unprecedented arrangement with the Trump administration to secure export licenses for the Chinese market. The news was initially reported by The Financial Times and later the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News. The companies obtained licenses last week for the Nvidia H20 and AMD MI308 AI chips.\n\n\"We negotiated a little deal,\" Trump said at a Monday press conference.\n\nNvidia had designed the H20 as a lower-level AI chip specifically for the China market to avoid U.S. export curbs. In April, the Trump administration banned H20 exports. In June, President Donald Trump reversed course after meeting Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the White House. But no actual export licenses were granted in the next several weeks.\n\nSome observers noted that the deal may run afoul of the Constitution, which bars export taxes or duties. \"No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\"\n\nNvidia, AMD Stock\n\nNvidia and AMD stock had rallied on the Trump's June decision to OK H20 and MI308 chip sales. So did Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), which makes Nvidia and AMD chips. Regaining access to the China market will likely still be worth it, but the 15% cut will impact profits.\n\nNvidia dipped 0.35% Monday while AMD 0.3% after both stocks traded up and down during Monday's session.

Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Plug Power grew its sales at an incredible 21% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\n\nPlug Power Quarterly Revenue\n\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Plug Power’s recent performance marks a sharp pivot from its five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 12.6% over the last two years. Plug Power isn’t alone in its struggles as the Renewable Energy industry experienced a cyclical downturn, with many similar businesses observing lower sales at this time.\n\nPlug Power Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\n\nThis quarter, Plug Power reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 21.4%, and its $174 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 10.4%.\n\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 23.7% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is eye-popping and implies its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

And you also mentioned earlier, Ali, that this is really about uh or separately from the Nvidia AMD. I actually think they're potentially linked. I mean, think about the timing of the news coming out over the weekend, plus this truce or this pause, if you will, uh you got to you got to think that something was going on in the back end with both of these, with the countries and these private companies. I I do think though, from everything that we've seen from the second administration, these types of delays are the norm, but this new deal between the private and public sector, this is definitely something new and shocking. Shocking.\n\n01:12 Speaker B\n\nYeah, I hope you brought up that AMD video news and Dan, I want to bring you into this conversation, Nvidia, AMD, China chips, two companies that will give 15% of their China chip revenue to the US government. What kind of financial impact could a deal like this have on their bottom lines? And it got me thinking is handing over around three billion or so in change to the government worth it if it means resuming sales to China?\n\n02:00 Dan Howley\n\nYeah, so so far uh analysts are saying uh this is kind of, you know, the price of doing business uh almost. If it gets them back into the Chinese market, then that's huge. Uh they're not seating it to uh the likes of Huawei, uh they're ensuring that uh Nvidia and AMD are still in there. I think one of the things that folks pointed out was, look, yes, it is 15% of sales, but it's better than nothing. Uh the other thing is that uh there could be a new precedent that's being set here and that's on the downside, you know, does this mean that other companies will have to pay and what does that mean for for other chip manufacturers that want to sell into the Chinese market? So I think it's it's kind of a double edge uh double edge sword at this point. Uh when you look at Nvidia overall though, you know, you're you're talking about uh like you said, $3 billion dollars. It's not a huge hit to them, uh especially since right now, they're not accounting for any China revenue. Uh and they were expected to have uh take a hit on tariffs in the current quarter uh in addition to the the hit they took last quarter. So, you know, we could see this start to pick up when they start to ramp back up as far as selling in. Now, it seems as though we're we're starting to get that kind of ball rolling when the the announcement came that they were going to be able to start selling again about a month ago. It seems like it's going to start in relatively short order. I say relative because the chip industry moves slowly, but you know, it could be something that we start to see maybe in Q3, maybe in Q4 on the balance sheets.\n\n04:38 Speaker B\n\nAnd Dan, you're just talking about some of that analyst commentary, the precedent that this could set. What do you think this means for the wider semiconductor supply chain?\n\n04:52 Dan Howley\n\nI think it means they have to be aware that this is a possibility for them as well. It's not just uh Nvidia, it's not just AMD. Uh if you're going to be selling chips into a market like China that are high-powered, um I mean, not even necessarily high power, the ones they sell into China are uh degraded compared to what they they have for uh the US and uh its allies. But I think if you're selling a chip that deals in this kind of area, a sensitive area like AI, you may have to pay this kind of fee to be able to continue to play in that space and and generate that revenue.\n\n05:44 Speaker B\n\nAnd Hope, what's your opinion and thought on the precedent that this sets? Not just for these big tech companies, but maybe some of those smaller players as well.\n\n05:54 Speaker A\n\nYeah, and I think it depends on how critical the companies are. I think Nvidia, AMD are critical to the global supply chain of AI. I think if you look at software makers, if you look at other types of companies, if they are not as critical, I don't think these deals will actually come to fruition. One thing I think a lot of investors should be looking out for is just how much of this cost is actually passed on to China. So if Nvidia and AMD are now having to pay the US 15% of those sales of those new advanced chips through the new export controls being lifted, uh if if China can pay, of course, they will then boost the top line for both of these companies. I think the bigger picture here, the big macro picture here is that both of these companies are basically ping pong balls in this trade war in the geopolitical tensions. Again, I mentioned at the top here that the timing of the of the tariff uh being put on pause for for China is coming around the same time that this announcement is being made. I I really I really don't think that that's a coincidence, and I do think we need to look at the timing very, very closely to see exactly where the demonstration is thinking about placing all the chips on their board.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:50:27.487282+00:00"}

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock gained 3.4% on the news that Barclays raised its price target on the stock. The investment bank lifted its price target to $45.00 from $29.00, a significant increase of over 55%. Despite the substantial jump in the price objective, Barclays maintained its 'Equal-Weight' rating on the technology company's shares. This analyst action followed the company's disappointing fiscal fourth-quarter results from earlier in the week, where both revenue and earnings fell short of estimates.\n\nSuper Micro is up 51.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.60 per share, it is still trading 27.5% below its 52-week high of $62.88 from August 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Super Micro’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $14,964.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

Nvidia shares were little changed.\n\nChina’s government, meanwhile, has grown increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese firms deploying the H20 and is unlikely to warm to the idea of a chip tax. Yuyuantantian, a social media account affiliated with state-run China Central Television that regularly signals Beijing’s thinking about trade, on Sunday slammed what it described as security vulnerabilities and inefficiencies of Nvidia’s chip.\n\nThere’s no guarantee the arrangement with Nvidia and AMD will succeed. Trade experts said it’s vulnerable to legal challenges because it could be construed as an export tax, something that’s not allowed under the Constitution. The chipmakers themselves said it will take months to revive production of the parts — assuming Chinese customers even opt for dated components.\n\nThe chip companies’ consent to cede part of chip sales underscores the urgency of their desire to cater to customers in the world’s second-largest economy. The US government has cut off sales of the most capable AI chips, arguing that China might use them for military purposes, instead allowing shipment of only pared-back products. But the Trump administration has consistently relented on trade conditions in exchange for financial concessions — and in this case officials said the chips are not the most advanced, playing down their national security implications.\n\nTrump said he’d originally told Nvidia that he wanted a 20% cut for the US if he cleared H20 sales to China but eventually settled for a 15% share. The two negotiated “a little deal,” he said.\n\nNvidia plans to share 15% of the revenue from sales of its H20 AI accelerator in China, US President Donald Trump said in a briefing with reporters on Monday. AMD will deliver the same share from MI308 revenues, a person familiar with the situation said, asking not to be identified discussing internal deliberations.\n\nNvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from Chinese AI chip sales to the US government in an unusual, legally questionable deal that reflects the Trump administration’s willingness to soften export controls in exchange for financial payouts.\n\nStory Continues\n\n“Both Nvidia and AMD already said they would start shipping to China, so that market reaction already happened,” said Jay Goldberg, an analyst at Seaport Global Securities. The big question is exactly when they’re going to start delivering to China again, especially now that there are strings attached, Goldberg said.\n\nThe deal also threatens to undermine the US argument that some trade controls are necessary to safeguard national security, said Jacob Feldgoise, a researcher at the DC-based Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “This seeming quid pro quo is unprecedented from an export-control perspective,” he said. “The arrangement risks invalidating the national security rationale for US export controls.”\n\nWATCH: Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China to the US government. Tom Mackenzie has the details.Source: Bloomberg\n\nWhen the Trump administration first decided to grant export licenses to Nvidia and AMD last month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said exports of H20 chips were part of trade talks with China and were used as “a negotiating chip.” White House AI adviser David Sacks emphasized at the time that the product wasn’t “the latest and greatest.”\n\nTrump reiterated these points at the briefing on Monday, calling Nvidia’s H20 “an old chip” and hailing the company’s latest Blackwell chip as the “super duper advanced” one. He signaled though that he’d be open to negotiate another deal with Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to sell a scaled-back version of the most advanced Blackwell chip to China, too. “I think he’s coming to see me again about that,” Trump said.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said the company follows US export rules, adding that while it hasn’t shipped H20 chips to China for months, it hopes the regulations will allow US companies to compete in China. AMD similarly said in a statement Monday that it’s adhering to all US export-control laws.\n\nThe US government has meanwhile begun approving export licenses for the chips. AMD’s initial license applications have been cleared, the company said Monday. The Financial Times earlier reported on the revenue-sharing deal.\n\nTrump has targeted chipmakers in the past week with a series of declarations that were light on specifics and rattled companies from Silicon Valley to Asia. On Wednesday, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on imported chips, unless companies also made investments on US soil. On examination, though, those new tariffs would apply to almost no one since most major chipmakers appear to be covered by existing investments or separate trade deals.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump called on Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan to resign, describing the Malaysia-born entrepreneur as “highly conflicted” without giving details. Tan, who sent a letter to employees assuring them that he had engaged with the administration, is expected to meet with Trump on Monday, a person familiar with the situation said. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the meeting.\n\nTan has been targeted by Republican Senator Tom Cotton over historical business ties to China.\n\nHuang has lobbied long and hard for the lifting of restrictions, arguing that walling China off will only slow the spread of American technology and encourage local rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co. In yet another sign that his message is getting through to the White House, Trump described Huang on Monday as a “great,” “very brilliant guy.”\n\nThe tax is expected to funnel some capital to the US — but not an enormous amount in relative terms. Both Nvidia and AMD have said it’ll take time to ramp back up production of their China-specific products — even if order levels return to previous levels, which is uncertain.\n\nWATCH: Michael Kratsios, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, comments on plans for location tracking for chips.Bloomberg: The Asia Trade”.\n\nNvidia raked in $4.6 billion of revenue from the H20 in the fiscal quarter ended April 27 — days after new restrictions on shipping the AI accelerator to China were imposed.\n\nIt also said it had been unable to ship $2.5 billion of H20 China revenue in that period because of the new rules. That implies it would have got more than $7 billion in H20 sales to China during the period. If it can return to that level, the US government will stand to get about a billion dollars a quarter from its deal.\n\nAMD could generate $3 billion to $5 billion of 2025 revenue if restrictions were lifted, Morgan Stanley estimates. Chinese alternatives such as Huawei’s Ascend chips now account for 20% to 30% of domestic demand, it reckoned.\n\n“The US government clearly needs the money given its deficits and eagerness to collect tariffs,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. “But the complication is China’s accusations about H20 chips containing back doors, which could be a negotiation tactic to highlight that the country is not ‘hard up’ for US chips.”\n\nFor its part, Nvidia emphasized that its H20 chip is “not a military product or for government infrastructure.” China has “ample supply of domestic chips,” the company said in an emailed statement. “It won’t and never has relied on Americans chips for government operations, just like the US government would not rely on chips from China.”\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu, Emily Forgash, Winnie Hsu, Jessica Sui, Wendy Benjaminson, Kevin Whitelaw, Shadab Nazmi and Yasufumi Saito.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:50:36.165695+00:00"}

The automotive division performed notably well, with its voice assistant expected to be integrated into a major original equipment manufacturer (OEM) producing vehicles for both Chinese and global markets.\n\nThe company increased its full-year outlook due to adding more customers, mainly in China. SoundHound AI now expects total revenues for the year to range from $160 million to $178 million, up from its previous forecast of $157 million to $177 million. Revenues have been steadily increasing, suggesting that it may reach the upper end of its latest sales estimate.\n\nMore Reasons to Be Bullish on SoundHound AI\n\nThe worldwide acceptance of AI-powered voice-recognition systems is expected to occur quickly as they continue to improve.

Or has he, or has been handled by the president, I guess you could say, um with his various meetings in Washington and sort of trying to finesse things in NVIDIA's direction.\n\n00:35 Bill\n\nWell, he's been very astute at working with President Trump. He's made these concessions. Uh he very very much wants to do more business in China. Intel in the past has done exactly the same thing. Uh I think if they're not giving their latest and greatest technology to the Chinese, it may be okay. I'm very wary about giving American technology to China where we're in a big race, particularly AI technology. But uh I think it's, we'll see. My big concern is this is going to spread not just to semiconductor, it's going to spread to other industries. Will we see in pharma where there's a a pay to play so to speak that the US administration will be taking a share of that because the technology research was done in the US. And I I would be very very concerned about that. We seem to be developing much more of a mercantilist approach to our companies and and walking right up if not crossing over the line to separation between government and free enterprise. That's my biggest concern, Julie.\n\n02:43 Speaker A\n\nAnd Bill, you know, even if Terry is right that this this particular type of structure of deal is a one-off, to your point, we have seen a whole host of different flavors of that mercantilist approach that you're talking about. What in your view are the risks of that approach?\n\n03:22 Bill\n\nWell, that we don't have a line between government and capitalism, as you see in many other countries. And I think that's a big concern. How far do you go? The president just advocated not directed the firing of Intel CEO with no evidence that he uh, yes, he has connections in China. So does Tim Cook, so does Elon Musk. But that should not be a prima fascia evidence for firing him. So I see the the CEO of Intel is hustling into the White House today to try to make peace with the president. But how far will this go? That's my concern and how much direction will there be to private industry about how to run this company? We have the golden share of Nippon Steel. And so the president's clearly taking an investment if you will, on behalf of the government in in a lot of industries. And I'm concerned, you know, we're just at the start of this administration. How far is that going to go? And we'll see. And also, the commitments being made, huge. I mean, like Apple, $100 billion on top of $500 billion. Uh enormous in four years. A lot of that won't play out till the end of the administration, but I think these tariffs, no, I think is going to take effect much sooner.\n\n05:28 Speaker A\n\nAnd and Terry, you know, sort of what we hear Bill describing there. What are the implications for investors, both in the case of AMD and NVIDIA, but also just sort of the the way that companies need to approach this administration in the future? From an investment perspective, what do people need to think about?\n\n06:03 Terry\n\nWell, take this NVIDIA AMD story with the 15%. Put it to, put it to the side for one second. What you've got though, is a situation where there is much more government direction and aspiration to direct the economy than there was before. The administration has been crystal clear about that. And as a matter of, as a matter of United States policy, as a matter of national security policy. One of Belsen's mantras has been for months that US National Security Policy is United States economic policy. Economic policy is national security policy. You have a situation here where they're doing everything they can, including providing huge incentives to the the manufacturing industry to onshore, to put to use tariffs in part to push different industries to onshore critical materials and and goods and the like. They've done everything short of invoking the Defense Production Act, which would essentially harness industry to government aims. Why are they doing that? Because they're, they are urgent about the nature of the Chinese challenge and how relatively speaking, how little time they think they have to write the ship. Uh and frankly, harness industry to to right size the economy to meet the Chinese challenge. That's what they think. They've been very transparent about that. And I would I would imagine that would continue and frankly, accelerate. Markets continue to be surprised every time they see something happen, like the United States taking an investment in rare earths. But you you can expect a lot more of it.

The result: an extraordinary concession from a $4.5 trillion corporation that will give the United States a percentage of every high-end AI chip sold in China.\n\nThe deal, which AMD also signed for some of its chips, could split the difference between two competing Trump administration goals: maintain America’s AI dominance while securing a critical trade agreement with China. It could also give the White House billions of dollars to spend as it wishes.\n\nWhat Nvidia agreed to\n\nNvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China in exchange for licenses to export their technology there.\n\nThe White House in April blocked the export of certain AI chips to China, including Nvidia’s H20 chips and AMD’s MI308 chips. The deal with the Trump administration allows the companies to obtain export licenses to restart sales of those chips in China, a US official told CNN. The Financial Times first reported the story Sunday.\n\nNvidia previewed the deal last month, when it said it would resume sales of the H20 chip to China after the Trump administration expressed openness to allowing the export of certain AI chips again. But the 15% payment was a surprise. Trump said Nvidia was initially asked to pay a 20% cut, but they negotiated the rate down to 15%.\n\nThe deal came together after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, the official said. Although the export licenses were granted Friday, no shipments have yet been made.\n\n“We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”\n\nAMD has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nHow extraordinary is this?\n\nGovernments, including the United States, have taken control of companies in the past when they were considered to be of strategic importance to national security. During the financial crisis in 2009, the United States took control of General Motors and Chrysler, and the proceeds of those stakes went directly into the US Treasury after the government sold them for a profit.\n\nBut it’s not clear that the US government has ever demanded a percentage of a company’s business without taking an equity stake – or if it’s even legal to do so.\n\nThe US Constitution forbids taxes on exports. To get around that, the deal’s terms have been structured as a voluntary agreement, so it won’t be considered a tax or a tariff, a US official said. Instead, Nvidia and AMD will voluntarily send funds to the US government. The companies will have no say whatsoever on how the US government deploys that money after it is sent.\n\n“It’s hard to identify any historical precedent for this sort of arrangement,” said Sarah Kreps, law professor and director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University’s Brooks School of Public Policy.\n\nWhat about national security?\n\nIn recent years, the US government has sought to restrict China’s access to advanced American technology in an effort to slow its progress on AI and let the United States get farther ahead. But the White House’s reversal on export controls may be an acknowledgement that China is advancing in AI regardless, so American companies might as well be allowed to benefit. It could also give the White House another way to raise revenue for the US government, along with tariffs.\n\n“It seems like there’s been some vacillation within the administration about and toward China, and I think that reflects the internal divide within the administration between the China hawks and the economic pragmatists,” Kreps said. “It seems like increasingly, the economic pragmatists are holding sway.”\n\nThat approach would align with arguments from Nvidia’s Huang, who has said that restricting sales of American AI chips is bad for US national security. Chinese developers could simply undermine US leadership by creating their own alternatives if they can’t buy American technology, according to Huang, who has met with Trump repeatedly in recent months.\n\nThe White House agrees with Huang, believing it’s better to have China locked into a US-made chip sold through legitimate channels than to force China to the black market, a US official said. China has been able to subvert existing channels to obtain restricted chips anyway.\n\nWhy is Trump charging 15%?\n\nBig questions remain about where the 15% commission idea emerged and what it could mean for national security.\n\nA US official said that the payment allows the administration to maintain control of the export process and bring in revenue for the US government in the process. Still, it’s not clear that the penalty for Nvidia and AMD will effectively limit the flow of the chips or erase any potential national security issues.\n\n“If there’s a legitimate national security concern about exporting these chips to China, then I don’t see how the payments to the US government address those risks. In fact, they don’t at all,” said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And if there’s not a sufficient national security risk or they can be adequately mitigated … then the US government should just get out of the way and expect nothing in return.”\n\nWhat does this mean for Nvidia?\n\nNvidia released the H20 chip last year as a way to maintain access to the Chinese market — which made up 13% of the company’s sales in 2024 — in the face of US export controls imposed by the Biden administration.\n\nBut the chips are widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek, an advanced Chinese AI model that shook Silicon Valley upon its release earlier this year, raising concerns that China was further ahead on AI than previously understood.\n\nAfter the Trump administration barred H20 sales to China in April, Nvidia said it took billions of dollars in charges and lost revenue because of the export controls in the first quarter and projected a similar outcome in the second quarter.\n\nSo, even if it has to fork over 15% of those sales to the White House, resuming shipments of the H20 to China could mean billions more dollars in revenue for Nvidia — which became the first publicly traded company to top $4 trillion in valuation last month. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose as much as 0.5% on Monday.\n\nCombined, Nvidia and AMD could earn as much as $35 billion in annual revenue from sales of their H20 and MI380 chips to China, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino’s estimates. That means the White House would earn around $5 billion in revenue. “We acknowledge the tax will have a negative impact on profit margins tied to China sales but view the reentry into the second-largest GPU market to be worth the cost,” Zino said in emailed commentary Monday.\n\nHow important are these chips?\n\nTrump on Monday called Nvidia’s H20 chip “obsolete,” saying that China “already has it in a different form.”\n\nBut some experts disagree with Trump’s characterization of the chips.\n\n“These H20s are still state of the art,” CSIS’s Kennedy said. Although they’re less advanced, in some ways, than other Nvidia chips, “they also come with elements that make them extremely sophisticated and valuable,” including their memory capabilities.\n\nNvidia’s H20 chip is also good at inference, says Param Singh, professor of business technologies and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University, which refers to the process an AI model goes through when answering a question.\n\nBut Nvidia’s H100 and H200 series chips, as well as its Blackwell line of chips, are much more powerful and better equipped to train large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-5 he says. It’s not the same as calling it obsolete, but using a chip like the H20 instead could mean it might take longer to train cutting edge AI models.\n\n“There’s a huge difference in the amount of calculations that an H100 chip could do versus an H20,” he said.\n\nNvidia likely reasoned that there is enough Chinese demand for the chips to make the 15% commission to the White House a worthwhile trade-off for its business, according to Kreps. “You have to do a calculation based on what was lost from the export controls,” she said.\n\nWill Trump approve more advanced chips?\n\nTrump on Monday left open the possibility that Nvidia could export its super high-end Blackwell chips for a higher price. The Trump administration had closed the door on the export of that technology to China — even after reversing course on the H20.\n\nHowever, Trump on Monday said that he’d consider allowing Nvidia to sell the Blackwell chip.\n\n“The Blackwell is superduper advanced. I wouldn’t make a deal with that, although it’s possible,” Trump said. “I’d make a deal a somewhat enhanced in a negative way. Blackwell, in other words, take 30% to 50% off of it, but that’s the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won’t have it for five years.”\n\nTrump said Huang will return to the White House in the future to discuss selling an “unenhanced” version of Blackwell.\n\n“I think he’s coming to see me again about that, but that will be a unenhanced version of the big one,” Trump said. “You know, we will sometimes sell fighter jets to a country and we’ll give them 20% less than we have.”\n\nWhat does China want?\n\nQuestions from Beijing about the security of American AI chips also raise uncertainty about just how successful Trump’s commission policy could be.\n\nChina could choose not to buy US tech firm Nvidia’s H20 chips, the social media account Yuyuan Tantian, which is affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, said on Sunday. It claimed that the chips could have “backdoors” that impact their function and security, following previous similar claims from China’s cybersecurity administration. Nvidia has repeatedly denied that its products have backdoors.\n\nHowever, that statement could be less an indication that China won’t buy American chips and more a signal to Chinese tech companies to continue innovating in semiconductors even if US shipments do resume, Kennedy said.\n\nWhat does this mean for a broader trade deal?\n\nFor the Trump administration, the cost-benefit analysis is that it opens up the flow of mid-tier chips to China while giving the administration a key bargaining chip in its ongoing trade talks, a US official said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called Nvidia export controls a “negotiating chip” in the larger US-China trade talks.\n\nBut China knows that, and its posturing over supposed security concerns with the H20 chip this weekend suggests that it won’t be won over so easily — even if it wants the chips for its market.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:50:51.765184+00:00"}

In exchange for the profit sharing, the US would grant export licenses allowing Nvidia to resume sales of its H20 chips to China and AMD to resume sales of its MI308 chips to China.\n\nBut legal experts say that neither the president nor Congress is empowered to tax exports. Article I, Section 9, of the US Constitution, known as the Export Clause, prohibits such levies, saying, \"No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.”\n\nNvidia stock fell 0.2% in Tuesday premarket trading, while AMD hovered above the flat line.\n\n“The Constitution is clear that there really cannot be any tax on exports,” said Douglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer with Jacobson Burton Kelley. “In my view, it's a slam-dunk unconstitutional tax on exports.”\n\nAnd the US Supreme Court has interpreted the Export Clause to prohibit Congress from imposing duties on exports, even when they’re characterized otherwise.\n\nIts controlling view on federally mandated export charges was stated in the unanimous 1998 decision in United States v. United States Shoe Corp.\n\nIn that case, the high court struck down a congressionally approved ad valorem charge of 0.125% on exports imposed by the US Customs Service. The charge, calculated based on the value of commercial cargo shipped through US ports, known as the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT), was intended to fund upkeep on US harbors.\n\nOn behalf of former President Bill Clinton’s administration, the US Solicitor General argued that the HMT was a “user fee,” and not a tax. But the court disagreed, reasoning that because the charge operated like an export tax, it violated the Export Clause.\n\nSiding with US Shoe, the court said in its opinion that the HMT “bears the indicia of a tax.”\n\nBeyond the Constitution’s export tax prohibition, the Export Controls Reform Act, passed by Congress in 2018, specifically prohibits charging exporters to obtain export licenses.\n\nPay to play?

Trump made the assertion about Blackwell while confirming that he’d hammered out a separate unusual deal with Nvidia that will allow the company to sell its less-advanced H20 AI chip to China if it pays 15% of revenue tied to those shipments to the US government.

But moves this big are rare even for Rumble and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock dropped 3.4% on the news that a surprisingly weak U.S. jobs report was released, fueling concerns about a slowing economy. The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs, falling significantly short of economists' expectations, while figures for May and June were revised down, erasing 258,000 previously reported jobs. The professional and business services industry itself shed 14,000 jobs. This data points to a cooling labor market, fueling concerns of a slowing economy. A weaker economic outlook often leads to reduced corporate spending on key services like IT consulting and professional staffing, which directly impacts the sector's revenue and growth prospects. The report immediately increased investor expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\n\nRumble is down 30.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $8.65 per share, it is trading 46.8% below its 52-week high of $16.27 from December 2024.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs, far below estimates, and massive downward revisions to the prior two months painted a much weaker picture of the labor market. This has stoked recession fears, which would directly impact demand for chips used in countless products. Compounding these worries, the White House announced new tariffs, including a 20% levy on imports from Taiwan, a global hub for chip manufacturing. This dual shock of slowing domestic growth and renewed trade friction creates a challenging outlook for the highly cyclical and globally connected semiconductor industry, leading to a broad-based sell-off.\n\nIntel is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $21.12 per share, it is still trading 22.9% below its 52-week high of $27.39 from February 2025.

Uh, well, we still haven't worked out the rare earths part of this, so I'm not sure that the chip, uh, the chip things is ever going to get done. Secondly, I think you've, you've, you're seeing on a broader scale here, tech humbled, right? It's, uh, uh, Trump apparently, uh, the last criteria here is a 15%, uh, payment out the door, uh, on the one hand, uh, a strategy which I think would probably depress exports if it was, uh, administered more widely. And on the other hand, the Chinese are saying, uh, apparently that they don't want the chip after all, because they're afraid of back doors, which puts the tech industry in a position of having to show that there's no back doors and in the bargain, where they might put back doors. So, uh, you know, you've got a situation here where this isn't really good for tech, uh, no matter how it, how it slices. Uh, finally, I think the Trump people probably end up with this is a one off. Uh, there's going to be a lot of negative backwash here and, but based on the concerns that, uh, that this sort of strategy might spread beyond this particular deal.\n\n02:22 Julie Hyman\n\nWell, and, and Terry, I just want to follow up and, and ask about the national security concerns also that, you know, the folks who are sort of China hawks had expressed all along that there were reasons to not allow these chips to go into China and getting some money from them doesn't really erase those concerns.\n\n02:54 Terry Haines\n\nNo, it doesn't. Uh, I will tell you the, uh, I, I think that's an entirely legitimate question to ask. I think the tie breaker here is, I'll give it to Secretary, Treasury Secretary Besson, uh, who said originally that this was something that the Chinese wanted. This was part of a broader mosaic of issues that the United States and China were working on. Uh, so, you know, they reluctantly decided to give away what Luck Nick called the third or fourth best chip, uh, in order, so they bent national security a little bit.

The comments, made on Truth Social just one day before the current tariff truce is set to expire, came with a public thank-you to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, though no further detail was provided. The timing is notable US farmers are only weeks away from harvest, when fresh supply typically boosts export potential. While China bought more than $12 billion in US soybeans in 2024, government data show no bookings yet for the new season beginning in September, a sign that trade tensions remain an obstacle.\n\nThe market reaction was swift. Chicago soybean futures jumped as much as 2.8% before easing to a 2.3% gain, with corn and wheat prices also edging higher. Analysts point out that this period often marks a shift in China's buying toward Northern Hemisphere origins, but the current pattern has leaned heavily toward Brazil, Argentina, and other South American suppliers. The US Department of Agriculture is expected to raise its domestic harvest outlook in an upcoming report, potentially adding to export competitiveness. Still, some market watchers caution that without progress in trade talks, China could meet its annual soybean needs entirely from South America, leaving US farmers sidelined.\n\nThe tariff truce deadline on August 12 adds another layer to the story, with signals from Washington that an extension is possible. Broader US-China tensions remain in play from Beijing's defense of Russian oil imports against US tariff threats to state-linked criticism of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chip performance. For now, Trump's remarks have injected a dose of optimism into agricultural markets, but whether this translates into sustained buying from China could depend on the trajectory of negotiations in the weeks ahead.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:51:30.631269+00:00"}

Trade policy experts cited by the Washington Post said the agreements amounted to blackmail and violated the US Constitution's ban on export taxes.\n\nNvidia did not confirm its new arrangement with the Trump administration, but a spokesperson told Yahoo Finance, \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.

Nvidia has repeatedly introduced new, lower-power chips to sell to China in the face of tightening US export controls, as the government has cited national security concerns. The chipmaker began sales of its H20 chips — graphics processing units based on its prior-generation Hopper architecture — in 2024.\n\nNvidia got hit with a surprise ban on exports of its H20 chips to China by the Trump administration in April, costing the company billions in lost sales and sending the stock spiraling.

Further announcements around duties since then and continued uncertainty over Trump's future tariff plans loom over markets, as the second half of the year gets underway.\n\nThis was followed by pauses on the US implementing higher tariffs on certain trading partners, extending the deadline by which they had to negotiate trade deals, which offered some relief to investors.\n\nUS president Donald Trump's unveiling of sweeping tariffs on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\" on 2 April also rocked the Mag 7, as well as markets more broadly.\n\nThese questions were front of mind when going into the first earnings season of the year, in addition to increasingly high expectations from investors as to what to expect from the performance of these companies.\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cheaper AI model in January raised questions over the level of spending on the technology by the major US companies and rattled investors.\n\nThe latest earnings season has been another test for the group, some of which had recovered more recently following a turbulent start to 2025.\n\nMany of the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants have now reported their latest quarterly earnings, with the results receiving a mixed response from investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Tesla’s headwinds are getting worse and investors are becoming less enamoured with the business.\n\n“Competition is fierce, tariffs are biting, the end of tax credits for electric vehicle buyers in the US could hurt, Elon Musk’s political escapades have been a turn-off for many people, and product innovation has failed to make waves.\"\n\nCEO Elon Musk's public feud with US president Donald Trump, following his departure from the Department of Government Efficiency, has weighed on Tesla shares. · Chesnot via Getty Images\n\n\"A push into more affordable vehicles implies a drop in profit margins, while the hope of being big in self-driving cars remains a fantasy rather than reality,\" said Mould. \"The Cybertruck product line hasn’t filled the treasure chest for the company, and for many the Tesla brand has become toxic because of Musk’s outspoken views.\"\n\nTesla shares are already down nearly 18% year-to-date despite rising as CEO Elon Musk stepped back from Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and said he planned to put more time back into the EV company.\n\nMusk's public feud with Trump, following his departure from Washington, has weighed on the stock.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of Tesla vehicles have continued to fall, amid backlash against Musk's political activities, with the company also facing increasing competition from rival EV makers.\n\nIn figures released early in July, Tesla delivered 384,122 vehicles globally in the second quarter, a drop of 13.5% for the same period last year.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) – Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 23 July\n\nSecond-quarter results from Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) topped Wall Street estimates, with revenue of $96.43bn versus expectations of $93.97bn. Earnings were $2.31 per share compared with a Bloomberg consensus estimate of $2.18.\n\nOn a business segment level, advertising revenue came in at $71.3bn versus expectations of $69.6bn. Search revenue topped out at $54.1bn versus an anticipated $52.7bn. YouTube ad revenue was $9.8bn versus expectations of $9.5bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud Platform revenue hit $13.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $13.1bn.\n\nThe company's outlook for capital expenditures (capex), however, was higher than expected. The tech giant expects to spend $85bn in the year, $10bn more than had been previously expected.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nBen Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the concerns around disruption from artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, Alphabet produced a really good set of numbers in its latest results. Revenues were up 15%, three percentage points better than expected and the search business delivered at the top of its range. The cloud business, meanwhile, was also a strong performer with revenues up 32% so it is encouraging to see the business growing strongly in the face of pressures.\"\n\nHe said that the increase in its capex guidance \"is a very solid raise and should be viewed as a positive, with investment looking to drive away the threat of Chat GPT\".\n\n\"Alphabet has been playing catch up somewhat in the AI arms race, but it is doing well to fend off the likes of Chat GPT,\" said Barringer. \"The big question will be whether it can keep innovating at a pace that allows it to maintain its search monopoly. This boost in investment suggests the fight will continue.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the next big event on the horizon for Alphabet's Google is a judge's ruling in an search antitrust case. Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to issue a ruling on \"remedies\" that follows the Justice Department's victory against the company sometime next month.\n\n\"While it is unlikely to be the end of the saga regardless of the result, any indication that its search monopoly will weaken will not be taken well by the market, especially given the AI threat currently,\" said Barringer. \"This ruling has the potential to either be a clearing event or add to Alphabet’s uncertainties.

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $3.65 compared to expectations of $3.37.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes the Azure cloud, produced $29.88bn in revenue in the final quarter. For the entire fiscal year, this AI division saw revenue surge 34% to a record $75bn.\n\nThe company predicted its capital expenditure for the next fiscal year would top $100bn, a 14% increase from the year prior.\n\nRead more: Shell announces further $3.5bn in share buybacks as profits beat estimates\n\nIt’s the fifth quarter in a row that Microsoft has beaten Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nBarringer said that \"while AI demand is clearly helping Microsoft, it isn’t the only game in town for the tech giant. Its cloud business, Azure, saw revenues grow 39%, well ahead of expectations, highlighting that demand for more traditional cloud based services remains strong. Microsoft has a good backlog in this business area too so we should see strong results continue to flow there.\n\n“The company did announce it was slowing the growth of its capex and changing the mix slightly, but as demand remains strong for AI we will likely see the likes of data centres take priority for a number of years yet.\n\nMeta (META) – Released second quarter results on Wednesday 30 July\n\nFacebook-parent Meta (META) surged 12% on Thursday after posting a bumper set of results after the market close on 30 July.\n\nMeta said revenue for the three months to the end of June rose 22% from the same period last year to $47.5bn. Meanwhile, profits jumped by 36% to $18.3bn. Profit per share came in at $7.14, above analysts' estimates.\n\nThe company said it expected its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114bn and $118bn. The company added its AI initiatives will “result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.”\n\n\"I think there are all these questions that people have about what are going to be the timelines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence ... we've observed the more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen. I think that that just continued to happen over the course of this year too,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nReality Labs logged an operating loss of $4.53bn while recording $370m in sales during the same period. This division oversees the Quest line of virtual reality headsets in addition to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company plans to build several massive data centres across the US. · Reuters / Reuters\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Meta has knocked it out of the park. Pick your metric and Meta crushed it, from ad revenue growth to daily users, all the way down to the profit lines.\n\n\"AI is clearly delivering real-world benefits for advertisers, and they're willing to pay more as a result. Average price per ad was up 9% over the quarter, a clear indication that Meta is delivering an improved product for both users and advertisers.\n\n\"The broader focus now turns to Meta's mammoth AI investment plans and whether it can continue to manage those costs without hurting earnings or free cash flow.\n\n\"CFO commentary called out higher costs next year, and another year of similar capex growth, which many analysts did not have on their bingo cards. Clearly, all this spending adds some near-term risks to the bottom line, but Meta looks set to be a clear winner in the AI space over the longer term.\"\n\nApple (AAPL) – Released third-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nInvestors in Apple (AAPL) had a muted response to its latest earnings in after-hours trading following their release, despite a surge in iPhone sales driving record revenue at the Cupertino-based company.\n\nThe company posted better-than-expected 10% growth in revenue year-on-year for the quarter to the end of June and an upbeat forecast.\n\nEarnings of $1.57 per share topped the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $1.43. Revenue of $94.04bn was better than the expected $89.30bn. Mac and iPhone revenue were both better than analysts had anticipated, while wearables and iPad numbers fell short. Greater China revenue was $15.37bn compared to an estimate of $15.19bn.\n\nApple expects tariffs to cost the company $1.1bn this quarter, CEO Tim Cook told investors on the earnings call. That's after the iPhone maker took a tariff-related hit to the tune of $800m during the fiscal third quarter which ran through June.\n\nServices revenue, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Pay, came in at $27.4bn, up about 13% year-on-year, continuing its double-digit growth.\n\nCook said Apple (AAPL) was increasing its AI investments. “We did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter,” he told analysts, without giving specific numbers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook warned in a second quarter earnings call at the beginning of May that tariffs were expected to add $900m to costs in the third quarter. · REUTERS / Reuters\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Britzman said: \"Apple is caught in a sentiment trap. On paper, the company delivered one of its strongest sets of results in recent years – robust iPhone sales, a return to growth in China, and encouraging guidance. Ordinarily, that would send shares meaningfully higher. There’s a sense of unease hanging over Apple, something we haven’t seen in a long time. Scepticism around its AI positioning, combined with lingering tariff uncertainty, continues to weigh on investor confidence.\"\n\n\"Apple should be a leading name in AI hardware, but that’s simply not the case,\" he added. \"Apple Intelligence was a flop, so a lot of hope now lies in an AI-powered Siri – but that might not come until next year. Brand loyalty gives Apple time to get the AI transition right, but it needs to start delivering.\"\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – Released second-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nShares in Amazon (AMZN) fell on the back of its second quarter results, as its outlook for operating income fell short of investor expectations.\n\nThe tech company beat estimates with its revenue up 13.3% year over year to $167.7bn. Market experts had estimated the company would report around $162bn in revenue and 9% growth. The company’s Amazon Web Services cloud computing division reported its sales reached $30.9bn in an increase of 17.5% year over year.\n\nHowever, Amazon projected that operating income in the third quarter would be $15.5bn-$20.5bn, which fell short of analyst expectations of $19.4bn.\n\nChief executive Andy Jassy warned of further uncertainty around Trump’s tariff policies and said he remained “unsure” who would absorb potentially higher costs over time.\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nHe also gave a clear indication that the e-commerce giant will continue its AI push. \"AI is going to be the biggest transformation of our lifetime,” he said during a call with analysts on Thursday. “Every single area of the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by AI.\"\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Just as it looked as if investors were ready to go all-in to big tech again, Amazon has come along and spoiled the party. A negative reaction to its results and a lacklustre response to Apple’s numbers would suggest the market has become more discerning.\"\n\n\"It is spending big on AI infrastructure, leading to more subdued profit guidance than expected,\" he said. \"The retail side of its business is caught up in Trump’s spiderweb of tariffs, which creates ongoing uncertainty.\"\n\n“Competition remains fierce for cloud computing services and Amazon’s sales growth rate is struggling to match rivals Microsoft and Alphabet,\" Coatsworth added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 27 August\n\nAs an enabler of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings have become a major event in the earnings calendar, with some build up to the release of its results as it tends to report later in the season.\n\nInvestor expectations have become increasingly high around Nvidia's earnings, with markets sensitive to any signs of slowdown for the chip giant.\n\nThe stock has seen a marked rebound following turbulence in the first few months of the year amid the DeepSeek AI market shock and Trump's tariff agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed curbs on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China in April. Shares popped last week after the company said that it would resume sales of its H20 chips in China. Nvidia said that the US government had assured the company that licences will be granted, with the chipmaker adding that it hoped to start deliveries soon.\n\nThe recovery in Nvidia shares since mid-April lows has meant the stock is now up 25% year-to-date and recently saw the company become the first publicly traded company to pass the $4tn market capitalisation milestone.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia beat expectations, posting revenue of $44.1bn compared with an expected $43.29bn. The chipmaker guided to revenue of $45bn, plus or minus 2% for the second quarter.\n\nGoing into the second-quarter earnings, Britzman warned that investors shouldn't expect \"any meaningful impact\" from the recent turnaround on H20 chip curbs, given the timeframe.\n\n\"However, taking a conservative view, new Chinese sales could drive a $10bn uplift in revenue by year-end, potentially more if things move fast,\" he said. \"NVIDIA may also be able to reverse some of the $4.5bn inventory write-down from the first quarter, providing a direct boost to earnings.\"\n\nHe added: \"Outside of China, overall demand remains critical. Markets have already heard from major customers that data centre expansion is a priority, which should benefit Nvidia.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:51:37.987797+00:00"}

And, and who knows how long this negotiation took place, but at the end of the day, the deal got done, the chips are being sold to China. Now, obviously, 85% of revenues out of those sales is not as good as 100%, but if I'm an AI focused investor, if I'm looking at my portfolio, and I have a lot of exposure to these chip companies, I'm feeling pretty good about this because 85% is also a lot more than zero, right? And so now we can kind of put this risk to bed. Yes, the these companies are ready to play ball with the administration. The administration is going to set the rules in a way we have not seen before. I mean, you're right. None of us have seen the government kind of, you know, get a piece of the pie in this explicit way before. But at the end of the day, the chip sales are going through.

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”\n\n“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.\n\nMusk has talked about Dojo since 2019, reiterating that Dojo would be a cornerstone of Tesla’s mission to achieve full self-driving and commercialize humanoid robots. Talk of Dojo halted around August 2024 when Musk began touting Cortex instead, a “giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.”\n\nIt’s not clear if Cortex is still in the works. TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla to learn more, as well as to inquire about the fate of the Dojo facility Tesla had invested $500 million to build in Buffalo, New York.\n\nThe shift in strategy comes at a time when Tesla is experiencing falling EV sales and significant brand damage after Musk’s forays into politics. Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.\n\nWe want to get to know our audience even better, and get your feedback on our coverage and events.

Two people familiar with the arrangement said the Trump administration had not yet determined how to use the money.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that the commerce department started issuing H20 export licences on Friday, two days after Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang met President Donald Trump. The US official said the administration had also started issuing licences for AMD’s China chip.\n\nThe quid pro quo arrangement is unprecedented. According to export control experts, no US company has ever agreed to pay a portion of their revenues to obtain export licences.\n\nBut the deal fits a pattern in the Trump administration where the president urges companies to take measures, such as domestic investments, for example, to prevent the imposition of tariffs in an effort to bring in jobs and revenue to America.\n\nNvidia did not deny that it had agreed to the arrangement. It said: “We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.”\n\nAMD also did not deny the agreement. “Our initial licence applications have been approved,” it said, adding that it “adhere[d] to all US export control laws and policies in our global business operations”.\n\nBernstein analysts estimate that, based on Nvidia’s guidance before the controls kicked in earlier this year, it would have sold about 1.5mn H20 chips to China in 2025, generating about $23bn in revenue.\n\nThe move follows controversy over the H20 chip. Nvidia tailored the H20 for the Chinese market after President Joe Biden imposed tough export controls on more advanced chips used for artificial intelligence.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration said it would ban H20 exports to China. However, Trump reversed course in June after meeting Huang at the White House. Over the following weeks, Nvidia became concerned because the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the arm of the commerce department that runs export controls, had not issued any licences.\n\nHuang raised the issue with Trump on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the exchange, and BIS started issuing licences on Friday.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:51:46.115205+00:00"}

Reportedly, it was going to get the okay for those export licenses, but now the reports are coming that it had to agree to pay this first.\n\n00:25 Dan\n\nYeah, it's it's a rather interesting uh, agreement uh, if if it all comes uh, kind of together the way it's it's been reported at this point that 15% of the revenue that they would get from China sales going to uh, the the administration basically. Uh, I mean, obviously, anything that assures that Nvidia and AMD will be able to sell into China, people will take. Um, you know, these are uh, some of their most important uh, countries that they or one of the most important countries that they sell into. Uh, you know, obviously, when when there was the ban in place, investors kind of were down at first, and then they were kind of saying, okay, well, you know, now that that revenue is removed, it's it's no longer a guessing game as to what kind of revenue the the company's going to be bringing in. We we just know it's going to be what what it's going to be. But now, uh, with China kind of back in play and then seemingly this ensuring that they'll be able to sell chips, you can imagine that that investors will be happier about that. Uh, but you have to wonder how much in the end, uh, the companies will end up having to turn over just to make sure that they get to sell the chips, period.\n\n02:12 Speaker A\n\nYeah, I I just want to mention as well that we did get a statement from Nvidia about all of this, and they didn't directly confirm the reports. What they said was, we follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. We while we haven't shipped H200 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide. America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America's AI tech stack can be the world standard if we race.

Uh, he said that he had to leave the company uh, that he was, you know, quote-unquote very conflicted. And this kind of goes back to his days with cadence.

And so, you know, they settled, uh, and then Senator Tom Cotton had come forward and said, look, you know, this is this is a big deal. Uh, someone should, you know, look deeper into this. Uh, Lipu Tan has some investments in Chinese companies. Uh, he is a US citizen.

The bank explained that Tesla’s Q2 results showed higher operating expenses due to AI projects and expanded AI training compute, with FY25 capex guidance over $9 billion, mainly on “AI-related capital expenditures.”\n\n\n\nDensityAI, led by former Tesla AI head Ganesh Venkataramanan, is continuing Dojo’s mission in stealth mode, stated Morgan Stanley.\n\n\n\nThe bank believes Elon Musk’s xAI is expanding AI “brain” development, using data from X (formerly Twitter) and Tesla’s real-world vision data. The analysts add that scaling back Dojo could boost collaboration between Tesla and xAI.\n\n\n\nTesla is said to be shifting emphasis to robotics and inference capability at the edge, leveraging its vehicle fleet as a “massive distributed inference cloud,” said Morgan Stanley. Incremental capex and R&D will focus on improving robot BOM cost and manufacturability ahead of Optimus commercialization.\n\n\n\nFinally, the bank notes that the GPU compute shortage is less acute than two years ago. They believe Tesla remains a strong Nvidia customer, but supply-demand balances have improved.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\n\n5 key thoughts as Tesla reportedly DOGEs Dojo\n\nClients buying into summer rally, bracing for later pullback, says BofA's Hartnett\n\n7 Undervalued Stocks on the Rise With 50%+ Upside Potential", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:52:04.014136+00:00"}

So, well, it looks like Wall Street's bull run looks set to continue. Remember last week, the Nasdaq hit two consecutive record highs while the S&P 500 narrowly missed its own record high on Friday. Big tech was firmly in focus last week with Apple posting its best week since 2020. And our first thing you need to know before that opening bell rings is again focused on tech. In what can only be described as an unusual agreement, Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay 15% of their China chip sale revenue to the US government. Why? Well, it's seen as one way the firms can secure export licenses from the Trump administration that were granted last week. Shares of both were down in the pre-market as you can see here. Now, Nvidia will give a share of its revenues from the sale of its H20 chip sales in China, while AMD will do the same for the sale of its MI308 chips. The arrangement reflects US President Donald Trump's consistent effort to engineer a financial payout for America in return for concessions on trade. His administration has shown a willingness to relax trade conditions like tariffs in return for giant investments in the US. Beijing, which has grown increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese firms deploying the H20 is unlikely to warm to the idea of a chip tax. Well, we're staying with chips for the next thing you need to know before that opening bell rings. Intel CEO, Lip Butan, is set to meet US President Donald Trump at the White House later today. They're going to be discussing cooperation between Intel and the US government. The Intel boss's personal and professional experience is also likely to come under the spotlight. Remember last week, the president called for Tan to resign amid suspicions of a conflict of interest. And remember, Trump ally, Tom Cotton, sent a letter to the Intel CEO questioning Tan's investments in Chinese companies. And the final thing you need to know before the opening bell rings is that Chinese electric battery maker, manufacturing firm, CATL has suspended production at one of its lithium mines in China. The move came after its mining license expired on Saturday. This sent the price of lithium futures soaring in China as well as stocks related to met, the metal needed to run electric cars.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:52:22.089829+00:00"}

While we haven’t shipped H20 [chips] to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”\n\nIt comes after Mr Trump barred sales of Nvidia’s H20 technology in China earlier this year to boost his tit-for-tat trade war with Beijing, wiping billions of dollars from the $4tn (£3tn) company’s value in the process.\n\nHowever, an apparent breakthrough has now been reached following a quid pro quo with the White House, which will also apply to rival chip giant AMD.\n\nSuch an arrangement is a first for a US company as businesses seek to navigate Mr Trump’s volatile trade war.\n\nThe deal is significant for Nvidia because of the importance of the Chinese market, where this year it expects to sell $15bn of its latest chips.\n\nHowever, it has already drawn scrutiny from critics.\n\nStephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, told Bloomberg: “To call this unusual or unprecedented would be a staggering understatement.\n\n“What we are seeing is, in effect, the monetisation of US trade policy in which US companies must pay the US government for permission to export. If that’s the case, we’ve entered into a new and dangerous world.”\n\nPeter Harrell, a former White House economics adviser under Joe Biden, added: “The US constitution flatly forbids export taxes.\n\n“Regardless of whether you think Nvidia should be able to sell H20s in China, charging a fee in exchange for relaxing national security export controls is a terrible precedent.”\n\nWhile the Nvidia deal is the first of its kind, the White House has previously allowed companies to avoid tariffs if they agreed to boost US manufacturing or create jobs in America.\n\nLast week, Mr Trump announced 100pc tariffs on foreign microchip imports.\n\nHowever, businesses, including Apple and Taiwan’s TSMC, were handed exemptions. Apple agreed to invest $100bn (£743bn) in US industry while TSMC has pledged to open new factories.\n\nThe Nvidia agreement comes as a truce on tariffs between the US and China is set to expire on Tuesday.\n\nAs well as sparking scrutiny in America, the export agreement has also raised national security concerns in Beijing.\n\nChina’s state broadcaster recently questioned whether Nvidia’s chips are “safe”, while China’s internet regulator last month grilled Nvidia executives over the security of its technology.\n\nNvidia has rejected any concerns, insisting last week that: “There are no back doors in Nvidia chips. No kill switches. No spyware.”\n\nThe US president’s deal with Nvidia came before he signed an executive order extending a tariff truce with China by another 90 days.\n\nThe order prevents US tariffs on Chinese goods from shooting up to 145pc on Tuesday, from their current 30pc level.\n\nMr Trump also sought to end chaos in gold bullion markets on Monday. He said imports of gold bars would not face tariffs, days after customs officials had claimed that they would be.\n\nThe US president wrote on social media: “Gold will not be tariffed!”\n\nThe confusion had caused US gold futures to surge to a record on Friday.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:52:24.647444+00:00"}

Two AI businesses to consider are ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%), since they provide key hardware to the industry.\n\nThe former makes cutting-edge lithography machines, which are necessary for producing the advanced microchips that power AI systems. AMD, one of Nvidia's top competitors, sells AI chips to cloud computing companies such as Microsoft.\n\nASML and AMD are both strong businesses. But determining which is a better AI investment isn't simple. So let's evaluate them in more detail.\n\nA look into ASML\n\nASML's lithography equipment is essential for manufacturing AI microchips because the technology demands immense computing power. This necessitates shrinking chip components to minuscule dimensions. For instance, a microchip the size of your fingernail contains billions of transistors. ASML's machines support this.\n\nAlthough the Dutch company plays an important role in AI, its stock has struggled in 2025, remaining essentially flat through Aug. 6. Part of this is because management anticipates economic uncertainty ahead as a result of factors such as President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nEven so, ASML expects 2025 sales to rise 15% over 2024's 28.3 billion euros ($33 billion). This is significant since 2024's revenue represents only a 2.6% year-over-year increase. And so far this year, the company is doing well.\n\nThrough two quarters, revenue stood at $18 billion, up from the prior year's $13.4 billion. Operating income rose to $5.8 billion from 2024's $3.7 billion. This robust growth resulted in net income of $5.4 billion, a strong increase over the previous year's $3.3 billion.\n\nThe excellent first-half results were tempered by a third-quarter revenue forecast between $8.6 billion and $9.2 billion. This outlook, when compared to the prior year's sales of $8.9 billion, suggests the current trend of strong year-over-year growth may be slowing down, which contributed to ASML's tepid stock performance.\n\nHow AMD is faring\n\nLike rival Nvidia, AMD stock is having a stellar year. Shares are up 35% in 2025 through Aug. 6. This performance is understandable following the company's second-quarter earnings results. The quarter's revenue reached a record $7.7 billion, a 32% year-over-year increase.\n\nCEO Lisa Su said, \"We are seeing robust demand across our computing and AI product portfolio and are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year.\" In that second half, AMD expects revenue of $8.7 billion, a strong increase over the previous year's $6.8 billion.\n\nDespite the sales growth, AMD exited the second quarter with an operating loss of $134 million compared to operating income of $269 million in the previous year. The substantial drop was due to new U.S. government restrictions introduced earlier this year on the sale of AI chips to China. As a result, AMD could not sell chips it had intended for Chinese customers, forcing the company to write off that inventory by $800 million.\n\nYet this makes its second-quarter sales growth all the more impressive. In the quarter, net income was $872 million, up 229% year over year. Consequently, diluted earnings per share soared 238% to $0.54 in a boon to shareholders.\n\nAMD is working to get government approval to sell AI chips to China again. When that OK is obtained, the company is in a position to deliver more outsize sales growth.\n\nDeciding between ASML and AMD\n\nAMD's outstanding performance, its anticipated third-quarter revenue growth, and an eventual return of sales to China point to it being the superior AI stock versus ASML.\n\nHowever, an important consideration is share price valuation. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.\n\nThe top chart shows ASML's P/E ratio has declined over the past year, indicating its stock's valuation has improved. Compared to AMD's recently rising earnings multiple, as seen in the bottom chart, ASML shares look like a bargain.\n\nASML's short-term sales may slow due to the current macroeconomic uncertainty, but over the long run, it's likely to benefit from the rise of AI. The company sees the technology as a significant chance for growth in semiconductors, similar to previous opportunities like PCs, the internet, and smartphones.\n\nIndustry forecasts support ASML's perspective. The AI sector is projected to grow from $244 billion in 2025 to $1 trillion by 2031. While this market growth is a tailwind for both companies, ASML's attractive valuation makes it look like the more compelling AI stock to buy right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:52:32.451687+00:00"}

Well, yes, that’s technically true, but it’s not very exciting or interesting. What’s symbolically bigger and better than $4 trillion? $5 trillion? There we go; now, we’re talking.\n\nLast month, chipmaker Nvidia became the first company in the world to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Currently valued at roughly $4.4 trillion, it achieved the landmark a little more than three years after tech giant Apple became the first $3 trillion company in 2022. Now, a seemingly two-horse race for the first-place $5 trillion trophy is underway.\n\nTale of the Market Tape\n\nTemporarily joining Nvidia, which achieved the landmark on July 10, was Microsoft, which became the second member of the $4 trillion club on July 31 after blowing past earnings expectations. But it exited shortly thereafter, with shares softening enough to bring its market cap back down to $3.9 trillion as of Friday.\n\nAnticipating that both companies would reach $4 trillion, Wedbush analysts wrote in June that they could reach the $5 trillion landmark in the next 18 months, noting the “tech bull market is still early, being led by the AI Revolution.” Both happen to be benefiting from overlapping tailwinds. Microsoft’s Azure is growing at breakneck speed as it has become the leading cloud platform for workplaces. The company’s cloud revenues for its latest fiscal year, which ended on July 31, rose 23% year-over-year to $168 billion. Meanwhile, the cloud computing surge that Microsoft has benefited from, of course, has increased the demand for computing hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia. Demand for hardware to support AI computing has, naturally, led to more promising growth in demand: All told, Nvidia predicted at its March technology conference in San Jose, capital expenditures on data centers will rise to $1 trillion by 2028 from $400 billion last year. As for who will hit $5 trillion with the wind in its sails first, the odds seem to favor the chipmaker:\n\nMicrosoft does earn more money. Net income in its fiscal year ending June 30 was $101.8 billion. Nvidia’s net income for the 12 months ending April 30 was a lesser $76.8 billion — but this ultimately impressive haul was achieved as the United States revoked the company’s license to export to China. (Nvidia is poised to reenter the market after the Trump administration offered assurances last month that it will be granted licenses again.)\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, is growing faster. In Microsoft’s latest quarter ending June 30, net income rose 24% year-over-year to $27 billion, and revenue climbed 18% to $76.4 billion. Nvidia’s net income in its latest quarter ending April 30 increased 26% to $18.7 billion, and revenue jumped 69% to $44 billion. And, again, it achieved that growth even with the ban on Chinese chip exports.\n\nThe Dark Horses: The only other companies with a current market cap above $2 trillion are Apple ($3.4 trillion), Google-owner Alphabet ($2.4 trillion) and Amazon ($2.4 trillion). But, unless Tim Cook rolls up to Apple’s next Worldwide Developers Conference with an iPhone that can teleport you to the French Riviera on your lunch break, these thoroughbreds are likely to remain dark horses.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:52:39.982203+00:00"}

Well, as you can see, Asian stocks rose with Japanese equities hitting a record high. China's blue chip stocks, the Shanghai Composite also traded higher on the news that the headline rates agreed back in May of 30% on Chinese imports and 10% on American goods will continue for the immediate future. Asian chip makers were among the biggest gainers. The likes of Japan's Advantest and China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International traded significantly higher. The new pause could also increase the odds for a meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi. On Wall Street, it's also looking like the markets will open on the front foot too. Oh, they're actually now just ticked a bit lower, but they were trading higher. We'll keep an eye on that for you. But there was some bad news for one big chip stock, Nvidia. China has urged local companies to avoid using Nvidia's H H20 processors, particularly for government related purposes. This is likely to complicate the chipmaker's attempts to recoup billions in lost China revenue as well as the Trump administration's unprecedented push to turn those sales into US government windfall. Just yesterday we told you about the president's plans to get Nvidia and AMD to hand over 15% of their China chip sale revenue to the US government. But another chipmaker Intel is seeing some big positive moves in the pre-market. And again, this has some involvement from President Trump. He met yesterday with the boss of Intel, Lip Butan. The president on Truth Social labeled the meeting interesting and went on to say, quote, his success and rise is an amazing story. Now just last week the president had called on Tan to resign, and a Trump allied Tom Cotton had written to Intel over concerns about Tan's ties with China. And finally, gold or Bitcoin? A growing number of investors feel that they're having to make a call between the two, and we're seeing big moves in these markets. Trump reassured gold buyers yesterday by saying tariffs would not be placed on imported gold bars, but that didn't stop prices sinking. However, yesterday we saw Bitcoin rally sharply, trading close to its record high. It's trading lower today, though. In the past gold has often been seen as the safe haven of choice, while Bitcoin is an asset that many see as having high growth potential, albeit with increased risk.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:55:45.637213+00:00"}

As of this writing, leaders like Palantir Technologies and Advanced Micro Devices advanced 148% and 44% year to date, respectively.\n\nSo, with so much optimism surrounding this emerging technology, what other AI stocks should be on the radar of tech-focused investors? Here are two of my favorites.\n\nSoundHound AI\n\nFirst, there's SoundHound AI (SOUN 0.50%). SoundHound is a leading provider of voice AI and agentic AI systems. The company's products help people interact with AI-powered tools, and they are often used in automotive or customer service settings.\n\nAs the AI revolution rolls on, communication between humans and AI systems will become increasingly important, and it will be crucial for organizations to make this communication as fast and easy as possible, both for the purposes of customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.\n\nAnd while I view SoundHound as a years-long investment due to its status as a young company with a long growth horizon ahead of it, there are promising signs that SoundHound is already executing at a high level.\n\nFor example, last week the company announced stellar results for the second quarter (the three months ending on June 30, 2025), highlighted by far better-than-expected revenue growth.\n\nIn addition to its soaring sales figures, the company announced a narrower-than-expected loss for the quarter and a robust pipeline of pending orders across a wide variety of industries, including healthcare, financial services, retail, restaurants, and automotive.\n\nSoundHound is a stock to watch, especially for investors who are seeking an AI stock that will take many years to reach its full potential. As with any stock, particularly in the AI sector, there are risks. SoundHound remains unprofitable, and competition within the AI sector is robust and fast-changing. Nevertheless, growth-oriented investors should consider SoundHound stock.\n\nNvidia\n\nThen, there's Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%). It may seem hard to believe, but Nvidia might not be getting enough credit within the AI investment community right now.\n\nObviously, there's plenty of focus on stocks like Palantir, which have registered massive triple-digit returns year to date, but Nvidia's 36% return is nothing to sneeze at. What's all the more impressive is that Nvidia has achieved that return while its market cap has skyrocketed.\n\nAs of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $4.4 trillion, the highest of any company. Moreover, its market cap now exceeds its closest rival -- Microsoft -- by some $600 billion.\n\nAt any rate, Nvidia remains the king of AI for one very simple -- and very good -- reason: It is the top dog when it comes to AI chips. The company's cutting-edge graphics processing units remain the most desirable hardware within the AI ecosystem, powering massive supercomputers and data centers that are the computing muscle behind the large language models and AI-powered tools that are taking the world by storm.\n\nLooking past the secular AI tailwinds that are powering Nvidia, it's clear the company is taking advantage of its strategic position and deploying capital smartly and efficiently. Gross and operating margins have moved in tandem, with both figures now well above 50%. Similarly, thanks to the company's massive $50 billion stock buyback program, the number of outstanding Nvidia shares has decreased by about 2% over the last three years, despite generous stock-based compensation awards to employees.\n\nNvidia has already rewarded investors with massive returns in recent years. However, the company's products remain integral to the overall AI ecosystem, which continues to grow rapidly. While there are risks to owning Nvidia stock, including potential AI spending deceleration or trade risks, I believe these concerns are outweighed in the long term. Investors should consider Nvidia stock now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:55:46.987729+00:00"}

Is $5 Trillion Inevitable?", "summary": "Nvidia's stock price is surging, putting pressure on the company to keep delivering impressive results.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/13/after-hitting-4-trillion-is-5-trillion-inevitable/", "published_at": "2025-08-13T10:00:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Nvidia's stock price is surging, putting pressure on the company to keep delivering impressive results.\n\nNvidia (NVDA 0.58%) has continued to soar higher after becoming the first company to surpass $4 trillion in market capitalization on July 9. On Aug. 7, Nvidia hit a new all-time intraday high and reached $4.48 trillion in market cap -- just shy of the $4.5 trillion mark.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a stock story; it's a market story. Nvidia is so large that it can single-handedly move the Nasdaq Composite or S&P 500 with a big gain. Gaining close to $500 billion in market value is like creating a company the size of Netflix out of thin air -- which is saying something, considering Netflix is the 16th-largest S&P 500 component by market cap. As Nvidia and its megacap peers go, so do broader market gains.\n\nHere's why I fully expect the growth stock to surpass $5 trillion in market value and why Nvidia has a clearly defined runway for future success.\n\nThe power of percentages\n\nThree years ago, Nvidia's market value was under half a trillion. It took a medley of investor optimism, earnings growth, and the dawn of a new age in artificial intelligence (AI) to pole-vault Nvidia over $4 trillion in market cap to become the most valuable company in the world. But Nvidia's road to $5 trillion and beyond will be much easier.\n\nGoing from $0.5 trillion to $4 trillion is an eightfold gain, whereas going from $4 trillion to $5 trillion is just a 25% gain. It's an unprecedented amount of value creation, but on a percentage basis it's not asking a lot over a few years. However, if Nvidia's earnings growth rate slows, investors may be less willing to pay such a premium price for the stock.\n\nNvidia commands a price-to-earnings ratio of 58 -- which is far higher than most of its megacap peers. But Nvidia is growing earnings much faster, so it can back up that valuation. However, if Nvidia were to slow down to levels of a company like Microsoft -- which has achieved 15% revenue growth over the last few years with net profit margins around 36% -- then Nvidia's valuation could compress.\n\nThe stock's P/E could come down, its earnings growth rate could slow, and it could still be an excellent investment, continuing to hit market-cap milestones. But the bigger question is, where are the earnings going to come from?\n\nNvidia's \"big four\"\n\nArguably the simplest reason why Nvidia can continue steadily growing over time is that its customers are some of the best companies in the world.\n\nIn Nvidia's quarterly 10-Q filings, the company typically has a section titled Concentration of Revenue. In Nvidia's most recent 10-Q from May -- which was the first quarter of its fiscal 2026 -- the company said that sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue for the quarter. Customer B was 14%, sales to another direct customer were 13%, and a fourth customer was 11%.\n\nAll four customers' revenue was attributable to Nvidia's compute and networking segment -- which is primarily high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers and associated hardware and software to handle AI workloads, like products that connect GPUs together and help the system communicate.\n\nCombined, these customers made up a staggering 54% of total quarterly revenue. While Nvidia doesn't directly disclose who these customers are, it's highly likely they are Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms -- all of which are using Nvidia chips to power their AI data centers, infrastructure, and services.\n\nOutside of these \"big four,\" there are plenty of companies that are rapidly expanding their cloud and AI aspirations, like Oracle through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Tesla is a big Nvidia customer, using its chips for its autonomous driving models. OpenAI is also a major indirect customer of Nvidia through the Microsoft Azure OpenAI service, which is a platform for using and developing OpenAI models.\n\nNormally, revenue concentration is a red flag because it means one or two customers can tank results if they pull back on spending. But in the case of Nvidia, it's arguably a strength because its top customers have exceptional balance sheets, growing earnings, and ample free cash flow. In other words, they have the resources and innovation pathways to steadily grow their spending over time, and in turn, contribute to Nvidia's earnings growth.\n\nNvidia needs AI spending to pay off\n\nNvidia's road to $5 trillion in market cap will be easier on a percentage basis now that it is hovering around the $4.5 trillion mark. However, for Nvidia to continue being a winning stock, its top customers have to get a worthwhile return on their investments. In other words, the AI market must continue to grow, and Nvidia must lead it from a compute and networking standpoint.\n\nTherefore, Nvidia investors may want to consider connecting the dots by following what its top customers are saying in their investor presentations and quarterly results. If they remain enthusiastic about AI and continue boosting their budgets for it, then Nvidia stands to benefit. However, Nvidia's earnings and stock price could take a big hit if the spending cycle goes from expansion to a slowdown.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:55:48.364402+00:00"}

The cash-rich companies, including the likes of Fastenal Co., Palantir Technologies Inc. and West Pharmaceutical Services Inc., have gained for three straight weeks, the longest run since Donald Trump’s initial tariff announcement sent markets into a tailspin.\n\nThe rotation lets traders who are growing anxious about the market’s three-month surge stay invested while trimming some exposure to more vulnerable companies. Buying shares of firms that have the financial wherewithal to withstand a slowing economy and the threat of margin compression from tariffs could limit downside exposure if the S&P 500’s run begins to falter.\n\n“We’ve been sensing that investors, while riding the rally higher, they’re getting nervous,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “A little caution is warranted” in the current market, he said.\n\nThe S&P 500 has surged 29% since a low on April 8, closing at a record on Tuesday. Much of the rally owes to artificial intelligence euphoria that’s powered Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to multi-trillion dollar valuations. Solid corporate earnings bolstered optimism that Trump’s chaotic trade policies haven’t caused the damage expected. But most of the profit growth was clustered in tech and tech-adjacent sectors, papering over weakness among purveyors of consumer products and makers of industrial equipment.\n\nAs a consequence, Citigroup Inc. strategists noted “early” signs of a rebound in value factors from July into early August as investors sought companies whose shares were underpriced relative to financial fundamentals. That has meant losses for profitless tech companies and other speculative plays.\n\nHigher quality, defensive names have “held their own,” said Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. Telecommunication companies, utilities and insurance firms have performed well, along with the tech behemoths, he said.
