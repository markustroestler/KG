The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed a slowdown in inflation, fueling a broad market rally that pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new all-time highs. For the capital-intensive semiconductor industry, the prospect of lower interest rates is particularly welcome, as it can reduce borrowing costs for expansion and research and development. The positive macroeconomic sentiment provided a significant tailwind for the entire sector, as investors anticipate that a more accommodative monetary policy from the central bank will stimulate economic growth and demand for technology.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nZooming In On Impinj (PI)\n\nImpinj’s shares are very volatile and have had 26 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 11 days ago when the stock dropped 3.2% on the news that the U.S. jobs report for July came in significantly weaker than expected while new widespread import tariffs were announced, sparking fears of a potential economic slowdown. The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs, far below estimates, and massive downward revisions to the prior two months painted a much weaker picture of the labor market. This has stoked recession fears, which would directly impact demand for chips used in countless products. Compounding these worries, the White House announced new tariffs, including a 20% levy on imports from Taiwan, a global hub for chip manufacturing. This dual shock of slowing domestic growth and renewed trade friction creates a challenging outlook for the highly cyclical and globally connected semiconductor industry, leading to a broad-based sell-off.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:04:00.831507+00:00"}

Micron is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, while FormFactor provides advanced test and measurement technologies essential for chip manufacturing. These companies are positioned to benefit from surging demand in artificial intelligence (AI), advanced packaging and high-performance computing.\n\nHowever, their financial performance, growth strategies and valuations offer different risk-reward profiles for investors considering semiconductor exposure. Let’s see which stock has an edge over the other from an investment perspective.\n\nMicron Technology: Riding on AI Memory Wave\n\nMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to AI, high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth. As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.\n\nThe company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. Micron has created a more stable revenue base by shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, its revenues and non-GAAP EPS soared 37% and 208%, respectively, year over year.\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote\n\nMicron is also riding on a strong wave of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest due to their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, which are ideal for AI workloads.\n\nIn January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain. Additionally, its newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with expansion in 2027, underscores the company’s commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.\n\nThe continuously evolving new tech trends and diversification strategy are likely to aid Micron’s growth over the long run. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 45.7% and 32%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 497.7% for fiscal 2025 and 57.9% for fiscal 2026.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:04:09.573194+00:00"}

An ABR of 1.55 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 33 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.7% and 12.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MU\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MU\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Micron here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.

DRAM stands for dynamic random-access memory.\n\nMicron had previously guided to adjusted earnings of $2.50 a share on sales of $10.7 billion for fiscal Q4. In the year-ago quarter, Micron earned an adjusted $1.18 a share on sales of $7.75 billion.\n\nOn the stock market today, Micron stock rose 4.1% to close at 123.75. Micron is in a cup base with a buy point of 129.85, according to IBD MarketSurge charts.\n\nMizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated his outperform rating on Micron stock and raised his price target to 155 from 150.\n\nMicron's improved outlook likely stems from strong demand for the company's high-bandwidth memory for data centers running AI applications, Rakesh said.\n\nIntel, Nvidia, AMD Also Making News\n\nOther chip stocks moving on news Monday included Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nIntel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan was scheduled to visit the White House Monday after President Donald Trump called for his removal last week over ties to Chinese businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.\n\nIntel stock rose 3.7% to close at 20.68 on Monday.\n\nAMD and Nvidia shares wavered on news that both have received U.S. export licenses to ship AI processors to China. However, both will have to give 15% of the revenue generated from those China sales to the U.S. government, according to media reports.\n\nMizuho Securities trading-desk analyst Jordan Klein said it is \"way better\" for AMD and Nvidia to get 85% of the billions in expected sales to China than \"100% of nothing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the contract manufacturer for both AMD and Nvidia, is likely to the \"biggest winner\" from the resumption of AI chip sales to China, Klein said in a client note.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAdobe Stock Downgraded As 'AI Is Eating Software'\n\nArlo Stock Leaps As Home Security Camera Firm Beats Views\n\nOuster Is Laser-Focused On Being The Eyes Of Physical AI.

However, Micron Technology also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nMicron Technology's dividend yield is currently 0.43%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $1.79 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $947 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $57,197 and $947, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $58,144. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Micron Technology stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 481.44%. In comparison, the S&P 500 total return for the same period is 258.20%.\n\nTrending: Accredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM—Secure $0.63 Shares Before 8/14\n\nWhat Could The Next 10 Years Bring?\n\nMicron Technology has a consensus rating of \"Buy\" and a price target of $149.07 based on the ratings of 28 analysts. The price target implies more than 37% potential upside from the current stock price.\n\nThe company on June 25 announced its Q3 2025 earnings, posting revenues of $9.3 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $8.87 billion. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.91, above the consensus of $1.60.\n\nMicron expects Q4 revenue of $10.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, versus estimates of $9.88 billion.

The company's US-listed shares jumped nearly 5% Thursday.\n\nTech companies have rushed to announce investments in their US manufacturing footprint in the hopes of avoiding Trump’s trade war wrath. So far, Nvidia has committed to producing $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the US. Micron made a similar $200 billion commitment. Texas Instruments (TXN) has said it’s spending $60 billion to bolster its manufacturing capacity in the US.\n\nCiti analyst Christopher Danely said the exemptions mean the semiconductor tariff will have “minimal impact … as US-based semiconductor companies with in-house fabs have operations in the US and fabless companies can commit to using TSMC, Samsung, GFS which have operations in the US.”\n\n“Fabs” refer to factories where chips are produced, and “fabless” companies outsource production of their chips to contract manufacturers such as TSMC, Samsung (005930.KS), and GFS (GFS).

However, that's only true if you plan to chase the sector's most beloved high-growth stocks.\n\nIf you focus on the value plays that are trading at lower valuations but still have irons in the fire, then there are plenty of tech stocks that are worth adding to your portfolio. Let's review three of those appealing discount plays: AT&T (T 1.28%), Micron Technology (MU 3.26%), and Cisco Systems (CSCO 1.00%).\n\nAT&T\n\nAT&T, one of the largest telecom companies in America, reinvented itself over the past few years by spinning off DirecTV, Time Warner, and its smaller media assets to strengthen its core 5G wireless and fiber businesses. By abandoning its misguided digital media ambitions, it simplified its business and freed up a lot of cash to expand its telecom business.\n\nAT&T generates most of its revenue from its wireless business, which served 118 million subscribers in its latest quarter. Its wireless postpaid business gained 1.7 million subscribers in 2023, 1.7 million subscribers in 2024, and another 725,000 subscribers in the first half of 2025. Its fiber business has also been expanding at a healthy clip. The robust growth of its wireless and fiber segments is offsetting the secular softness of its business wireline segment.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect AT&T's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3%. It trades at less than 7 times this year's adjusted EBITDA and it pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 4%. That low valuation and high yield make it a safe stock to buy in this frothy market.\n\nMicron Technology\n\nMicron is one of the world's leading producers of DRAM and NAND memory chips. It controls smaller slices of both markets than South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix, but it manufactures denser DRAM chips than its larger rivals.\n\nMicron's growth usually follows the boom-and-bust cycles of the memory market. The last bust happened in 2023 when the PC market cooled off from its pandemic-driven growth spurt, the 5G upgrade cycle slowed down, and data centers prioritized their purchases of artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerating GPUs over new memory chips.\n\nHowever, its growth is accelerating again as the PC market stabilizes, smartphone sales rise, and its data center customers install more solid-state drives (SSDs) and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to support the newest AI applications. That new boom cycle won't end any time soon.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in September 2027), analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of 27% and 45%, respectively. With an enterprise value of $133 billion, its stock looks like a bargain at just 7 times this year's adjusted EBITDA. It could still take years for Micron's current AI-driven growth cycle to peak -- and its stock could have plenty of room to rise before it runs out of steam.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nCisco is the largest networking hardware and software provider in the world. It bundles together a broad range of campus, branch, wide-area networking (WAN), and data center solutions in its end-to-end deployments, and it increases the stickiness of that ecosystem with integrated cybersecurity tools and enterprise collaboration services.\n\nCisco struggled over the past five years as the pandemic throttled its sales and disrupted its supply chains. As it overcame some of those challenges in fiscal 2023 (which ended in July 2023), its customers ramped up their hardware orders again. But as interest rates rose and the macro headwinds intensified, those customers throttled their hardware deployments. As a result, Cisco's inventories rose and its orders slowed down.\n\nCisco's business is stabilizing as it expands its security and observability segments, locks more customers into its sticky subscriptions and services, and benefits from the growing demand of networking infrastructure upgrades for AI-oriented data centers. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 5% and 9%, respectively. That's a solid growth rate for a stock that trades at just 17 times its forward adjusted earnings. It also pays a decent forward dividend yield of 2.4%.

Due to the proliferation of AI and high performance computing among data centers and hyperscalers, MRVL is experiencing massive traction in custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits, Custom high bandwidth memory Compute Architecture, Co-Packaged Optics Platform and Multi-Die Packaging Platform products.\n\nAs data centers perform a growing number of AI-related tasks, improvements in networking, interconnect, processing and storage capabilities, requiring high-performance semiconductor solutions become crucial. Marvell Technology is capitalizing on this opportunity with 800G PAM, 400ZR DCI, and 1.6T PAM digital signal processing products. This growth is evident in Marvell Technology’s data center segment, which has taken the lead among all its segments with 76% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\nMarvell Technology also plans to expand its customer base among hyperscaler customers that seek to stand out, cut expenses and want to gain more control over their AI infrastructure. Marvell Technology has collaborated with NVIDIA and leveraged the latter's NVLink Fusion platform to build comprehensive rack-scale AI solutions to meet the needs of hyperscalers.\n\nFurthermore, the shift from copper to optical connectivity in AI infrastructure represents a massive growth opportunity for Marvell Technology’s Co-Packaged Optics technology. Marvell Technology is also experiencing a recovery among its enterprise networking and carrier infrastructure segments on the back of the demand rebound.

That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nInstitutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$7.1b last week.

We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Micron Technology. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Micron Technology, (below).

During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Micron falls in, has gained 0.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMicron is expected to post earnings of $2.51 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +112.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +497.7%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.27 indicates a change of +57.9% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Micron.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:05:16.126241+00:00"}

Here's why they deserve a spot in your portfolio in August, 2025", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/31/2-top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-to-buy-now/", "published_at": "2025-07-31T21:11:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "These two well-known AI stocks are trading at bargain prices. Here's why they deserve a spot in your portfolio in August, 2025\n\nMany artificial intelligence (AI) specialists have seen their stocks skyrocket in the last couple of years. At the same time, some of the best names in the AI boom have been left behind. In particular, memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU 3.26%) and online services giant Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) look like fantastic buys right now. Their modest stock valuations don't reflect their massive growth opportunities.\n\nSo if you're looking for an AI stock to buy in August, you should give Google's parent company and Micron another look. Read on and I'll get you started.\n\nMicron Technology looks like a bargain right now\n\nThe memory chip market is notoriously cyclical.\n\nThe handful of leading chip suppliers never seem to be ready when another tech trend results in massive demand for digital memory (smartphones, AI, and increasingly computerized cars are just three examples). Then they build out their manufacturing facilities until the demand driver fades out or the new supply simply grows too large. That's where unit prices drop, the memory industry goes into a mini-recession, and investors wait for the next surge in demand.\n\nYou can see these cycles on Micron's stock chart, with a semi-predictable roller coaster ride with peaks and valleys. Importantly, each new top tends to be much higher than the last one.\n\nFrom that perspective, the AI-driven memory boom has been going on for about two years now. Some of the industry's cycles have seen two-year upswings followed by similar-sized downswings. And Micron's stock has gained 61% in the past two years -- maybe it's time for a correction?\n\nSome market makers sure seem to feel that way. Micron's stock trades at just 9.2 times forward earnings estimates today. Its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a minuscule 0.2. As a reminder, a PEG ratio around 1.0 indicates a fair valuation, in terms of proven profits and upcoming growth. Values in Micron's range suggest that investors aren't convinced by optimistic growth targets, or worried about the company's financial future, or both.\n\nBut Micron's sales rose by 58% in the past two years, while trailing free cash flows swung from a $4.7 billion negative reading to $1.9 billion of positive cash profits. Micron is the preferred memory provider for Nvidia's (NVDA 0.58%) latest and greatest AI accelerators. Modern smartphones ship with lots of extra memory in order to handle their built-in AI functions. In short, the growth catalysts just keep coming.\n\nMicron is playing a very active part in the AI revolution, but the stock is acting like it's just another short-lived upswing. If you believe that AI will drive business growth for years to come, Micron should be on your short list of stocks to buy right now.\n\nAlphabet is playing the long game\n\nAlphabet's stock has gained just 3% in 2025. That's far behind Nvidia's 31%, or even the 8% increase in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.13%) market index.\n\nAnd in the valuation corner, the Google parent's stock could double in price and still look affordable next to market darlings like Nvidia. That approximate ratio holds firm across many different valuation metrics, from price-to-earnings to cash-flow valuations.\n\nMoreover, I think of Nvidia as a one-trick pony while Alphabet always has another trick up its sleeve. Let me explain.\n\nSure, Nvidia's pony is an incredibly impressive racehorse that has taken Nvidia's business results to lofty heights in recent years. Still, I wonder what might happen to its high-flying stock if and when another chip maker starts winning large AI system contracts under Nvidia's nose.\n\nI'm not even speculating here. Longtime Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%) already offers a competitive solution in its Instinct product range. Furthermore, major buyers such as Alphabet and Amazon are designing their own custom AI chips nowadays. I'm not convinced that Nvidia's golden years will last much longer.\n\nAt the same time, Alphabet was built to last. The online search and advertising market won't be there forever, and the Google parent has been preparing for that sea change since forever. Alright, since 2014. Same thing in this ever-changing tech sector.\n\nAlphabet runs a leading media-streaming platform (YouTube), an early robotaxi specialist (Waymo), and the world's busiest mobile platform (Android). The Google Cloud service isn't dominating its market, but puts up a serious fight while developing cloud-based AI tools.\n\nLooking ahead, the company's next big idea might be medical research, or remote internet access, or maybe something I haven't heard of yet. Either way, Alphabet plans to stick around for decades, and its stock is on fire sale right now. Alphabet is pretty much always a decent buy -- it's just an even better idea these days.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:05:34.486564+00:00"}

In order to fight it, Micron will have to lower its own prices (hurting Micron's revenue and profit), or else it will lose market share to Samsung (also hurting Micron's revenue and profit!)\n\nAnd if that sounds like a lose-lose proposition for Micron, that's because it is.\n\nIn a note on The Fly this morning, Wells Fargo warned that Samsung's action will \"impact market prices,\" drying up much of the premium in prices between HBM3E and plain-vanilla DRAM memory, perhaps as early as H2 2025 (i.e., now).\n\nPriced at just 20x trailing earnings, Micron stock may not look too expensive.

On top of that, the share price is up 48% in about a quarter.\n\nSince it's been a strong week for Micron Technology shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Micron Technology moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\n\nNasdaqGS:MU Earnings Per Share Growth July 31st 2025\n\nWe know that Micron Technology has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Micron Technology's TSR for the last 5 years was 130%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nMicron Technology shareholders gained a total return of 5.0% during the year. But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 18% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market.

The decline stemmed largely from a one-time inventory cost as US export controls led to unsold AI chips at its foundry business, which relies in part on Chinese demand. Samsung’s shares fell as much as 2.2% in Seoul following the announcement.\n\nIts overall net income came to 4.93 trillion won, missing estimates of 6.37 trillion won, while total quarterly capital spending slid about 7% from the previous quarter to 11.1 trillion won, with most of it allocated to its semiconductor business.\n\nDemand for high-end memory products for servers was solid and the company expects “meaningful expansion” in such advanced products in the second half of the year, executives said. The chips-to-smartphones company has shipped its bleeding-edge HBM4 samples to some of its customers, they added.\n\nSamsung’s HBM4 delivers twice the performance of earlier generation HBM3E with significant improvements in energy efficiency, Kim Jaejune, Samsung’s executive vice president for memory, told analysts on a conference call Thursday. The company will aim to ensure timely supply of HBM4 to meet the demand as it enters full scale, he said.\n\nBut analysts said Thursday’s grim results reflect Samsung’s poor performance on high-bandwidth memory. The company’s share of the global HBM market in terms of bit volume slipped to 17% in the second quarter, down from more than 40% in the first quarter of 2024, according to MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint.\n\n“This suggests that Samsung has fallen behind even Micron Technology Inc. to rank No. 3,” in the second quarter, he said.\n\nStill, Samsung executives presented a more positive outlook for the next six months, with Chief Financial Officer Park Sooncheol saying “earnings expected to improve steadily as the year progresses.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:05:43.841191+00:00"}

Between earnings surprises, critical inflation and jobs data, a Federal Reserve decision, and a looming tariff cliff, investors are facing a powder keg of risk. The S&P 500 might be flirting with record highs, but August 1st could bring a shift. I’ll walk you through each of the market-moving headlines to watch in this week’s stock market update.\n\nWhy August 1 Matters More than You Think\n\nTrump’s proposed tariffs would affect major trading partners with rates up to 35% if deals aren’t finalized by the Friday deadline. China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are all in last-minute negotiations. Some deals are in progress. China and Japan have agreed in principle to frameworks that would keep rates lower. But others remain unsettled. More impactful are the sector-specific tariffs already rolling out. Steel, copper, and car parts are under new restrictions. Trump has also threatened additional tariffs on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber—some as high as 200%.\n\nWho Benefits from the Tariff Storm?\n\nThese aren’t bargaining chips anymore. They’re weapons in a broader plan to repatriate manufacturing and redraw the global supply chain. And for some U.S.-based companies, this could be a windfall. Some stocks stand to benefit massively from this shifting landscape. Pharmaceuticals: The administration is floating a tariff of up to 200% on imported pharmaceuticals to push drugmakers back to U.S. soil. While the market hasn’t reacted strongly yet - due to assumptions that implementation will be delayed - the announcement alone could rattle drugmakers like Teva which leads in overseas generics manufacturing. On the flip side, companies like Eli Lilly (LLY) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), both with significant U.S. production, could see a tailwind.\n\nSemiconductors: A proposed 25% tariff on imported chips and related equipment would impact a wide swath of industries, from autos to smartphones. But for U.S. fabricators like Intel (INTC) and Micron Technology (MU), this could be a breakout moment. Despite Intel’s recent disappointing earnings, its U.S. fabs in Arizona, New Mexico, and Ohio could become strategic assets. Copper & Steel: Tariffs on imported copper jump to 50% on August 1 and join the already high tariff on steel. That boosts domestic suppliers like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), with shares already up 16% this year. Steel, too, is seeing a resurgence, with Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) benefitting from its 100% U.S. flat-rolled production. Lumber: A brewing trade spat with Canada makes increased lumber tariffs all but certain. The administration is considering a 25% rate on Canadian softwood. Weyerhaeuser (WY), with over 10 million acres of U.S. timberland, could see higher prices and stronger margins.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:05:53.956392+00:00"}

The strong sequential growth in NAND revenues was mainly driven by a mid-20% increase in bit shipments. Strong demand for its solid-state drives (SSDs) across the client and data center end markets mainly drove robust growth in bit shipments.\n\n\n\nIn client SSDs, Micron achieved a record market share in the calendar first quarter. This was supported by its vertically integrated product portfolio. In data center SSDs, MU maintained record market share for the third straight quarter. This market dominance reflects the competitive advantage the company enjoys through its robust portfolio.\n\n\n\nTo further strengthen its position, Micron launched new SSDs based on its latest G9 QLC NAND, which includes Adaptive Write technology. According to Micron, these new SSDs deliver up to four times the performance of typical QLC SSDs. The company expects these products to benefit from trends like the growing adoption of artificial intelligence in PCs.\n\n\n\nManagement expects its NAND bit supply growth for calendar 2025 to remain below industry bit demand growth. This limited supply scenario could result in increased prices, supporting scope for margin expansion.\n\n\n\nTogether, these factors point to improving momentum in Micron’s NAND business, supported by growing SSD demand and tighter supply. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 NAND revenues is pegged at $8.52 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 17.9%. Fiscal 2025 total revenues are estimated to grow 46.5% to $36.79 billion.\n\nHow Competitors Fare Against Micron\n\nMicron competes with Western Digital Corporation WDC and Seagate Technology Holdings plc STX in the data storage market.\n\n\n\nMicron competes with Western Digital in the NAND market.

IDA’s trailing and forward P/E were 21.72 and 20.83 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nIDACORP, a regulated electric utility based in Boise, Idaho, is seen as one of the strongest growth stories in the utility sector, supported by favorable demographic and economic trends in its service territories of southern Idaho and eastern Oregon. The company benefits from robust population growth driven by affordable living costs and expanding employment opportunities, fueling steady residential demand.\n\nAt the same time, commercial and industrial customers are set to drive a significant uptick in electricity consumption. Major projects like Micron’s $15 billion memory fabrication plant and Meta’s new data center—expected to require 325 megawatts of continuous power—highlight the scale of upcoming demand. These structural drivers underpin a compelling outlook for consistent earnings growth and attractive long-term shareholder returns.\n\nWith demand accelerating across both residential and commercial markets, IDACORP stands to benefit from its strong regulated position and capacity to support the region’s growth. The company’s stable, regulated revenue base, combined with high-visibility demand growth, creates an appealing investment profile, offering a balance of predictable cash flows and upside potential.\n\nGiven these tailwinds, IDACORP is expected to maintain its trajectory of earnings expansion while continuing to reward shareholders, making it a differentiated name within the utility sector poised to capitalize on the sustained economic and population boom in its markets.\n\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Evergy, Inc.

As one of three global DRAM and NAND giants, it benefits from scale, process leadership, and high barriers to entry but operates in a deeply cyclical, commodity-like market, deterring many long-term investors.\n\nDRAM, its largest segment (≈70% of revenue), has gained market share to ~25% amid early DDR5/LPDDR5X adoption, node leadership (1αnm/1βnm), and a pivot to AI, automotive, and industrial applications. NAND (≈30% of revenue) remains more challenged, with Micron holding ~11–12% share, behind Samsung and SK Hynix.\n\nIts fastest-growing business, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), is critical for AI workloads; Micron’s HBM3E/4 products lead in power and capacity, with 2025 output sold out and share expected to reach 20–25% by year-end. Integrated manufacturing, U.S.-heavy production, and diversification limit geopolitical risk.\n\nFinancially, Micron is rebounding sharply: Q3 FY25 revenue grew 37% YoY to $9.3B, gross margin hit 39%, EPS surged >200% YoY, and free cash flow reached $1.9B despite $2.7B in capex. Management guides Q4 revenue up 15% sequentially to $10.7B and EPS of $2.50, with DRAM and HBM driving mid-teens bit growth.\n\nStructural AI, data center, and automotive demand should sustain a low-double-digit CAGR through cycles. Valuation remains attractive at ~10x FY26 earnings, with a PEG of ~0.4x.For investors with a 5–10 year horizon and a tolerance for 30–50% drawdowns, Micron offers exposure to secular AI-driven growth. Shares near $125 could deliver mid-teens annualized returns, with upside if current execution persists.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Micron Technology, Inc. by Oliver | MMMT Wealth in April 2025, which highlighted its technological edge, secular AI-driven memory demand, and undervaluation as key drivers. The company's stock price has appreciated by approximately 69% since our coverage. This is because AI and data center tailwinds accelerated. The thesis still stands as structural demand persists.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.13%) rallied back from significant early sell-offs to end the day roughly in line with yesterday's close, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 1.39%) slipped 0.4%.\n\nMicron faced selling action today following a Wall Street Journal report that said that the Stargate Project's $500 billion artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure initiative had run into challenges. Even though the broader market saw recovery in the afternoon on news that the U.S. has reached a trade agreement with the Philippines, the memory chip specialist's valuation was kept in the red by the Stargate news.\n\nA slow start for Stargate could hurt Micron\n\nIn January, the CEOs of SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate Project alongside President Trump at the White House. Stargate is a new joint investment venture between the three companies and MGX, and the partners plan on investing $500 billion to build data centers and other AI infrastructure across Trump's first term.\n\nAt the time of the announcement, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said that 10 data centers were already under construction -- but the WSJ's report today suggested that only one small data center is expected to be built this year. Micron is expected to be a beneficiary of the big data center build-out and could see softer growth due to delays.\n\nWhat's next for Micron?\n\nMicron's high-bandwidth-memory (HBM) solutions have become central to the bullish valuation thesis for the stock.

During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Micron falls in, has gained 6.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMicron is expected to post earnings of $2.51 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +112.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +24.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +497.7%. This estimate has changed +10.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.27 indicates a change of +57.9% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +16.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:06:18.881516+00:00"}

We believe this momentum is grounded in strong fundamentals, and MU’s long-term outlook justifies a buy position for now.\n\nNew Tech Trends Fuel Micron’s Growth\n\nMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.\n\nAs AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.\n\nThe company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. Micron has created a more stable revenue base by shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.\n\nMicron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain. Additionally, its newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores the company’s commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.\n\nThe continuously evolving new tech trends and diversification strategy are likely to aid Micron’s growth over the long run. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 46.5% and 32.9%, respectively.

Hynix’s leadership with Nvidia is set to hold, while a fresh slate of design wins at the ASIC arms of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), AWS, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) suggests Hynix will be locked in as the main or sole HBM supplier across the sector. Even as competition is expected to be heat up, it is unlikely to become a serious headwind for Hynix until late 2026.\n\nThe strong HBM demand has AI’s fingerprints all over it: AI is driving an unprecedented appetite for memory, from the cloud giants and Nvidia’s broader customer base to a revived group of tier-2 and tier-3 GPU buyers, especially as H20 exports to China resume. UBS points to TSMC’s latest call as evidence that AI demand is running well ahead of earlier forecasts, and notes that HBM bit shipments are projected to jump 35% next year to 17.1 billion gigabits.\n\nOn the pricing front, there is room for some negotiation around HBM3E as more suppliers come online, but Hynix expects only a “minimal to modest downtick” for 2026 compared with 2025. Far more important is the premium secured by first-mover advantage on HBM4, where Hynix expects to command prices roughly 40% higher than its outgoing generation—even after absorbing a 50% rise in cost per bit. Overall, UBS forecasts blended HBM pricing per bit to rise 18.5% year-on-year in 2026, driving HBM revenues to a projected $32.7 billion, and accounting for over 70% of SK Hynix’s operating profit.\n\nYet the HBM story isn’t without risk. Samsung’s delayed ramp could inject more competitive tension as the year goes on, and the steep increase in production costs for HBM4 could lead to more intense price talks further out. Investors are also watching capex closely, as Hynix’s expansion plans will depend on how Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell Ultra and Rubin product cycles unfold.

The DRAM segment, which accounted for a whopping 76% of the company’s top line, is getting propelled by the traction in data center, automotive, PC and mobile end market growth.\n\n\n\nMicron Technology’s DRAM segment is led by its products like low-power server DRAM and high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are experiencing a massive surge in use cases in Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads due to their higher capacity and low power consumption. Additionally, Micron Technology experienced a sequential surge of 50% in HBM revenues, which drove DRAM revenues to a record high in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nThe company highlighted robust momentum in the automotive end market, where advanced driver assistance systems and AI-powered in-vehicle infotainment systems are pushing higher memory and storage content growth. In the mobile end market, Micron Technology is benefiting from the growing demand for AI features, which is driving higher DRAM content growth for smartphones.\n\n\n\nThe company expects industry DRAM bit demand to grow in the high-teens percentage range in calendar 2025.

From chip giants such as Nvidia and Broadcom to software specialists such as Palantir Technologies and SoundHound AI, investors will have to pay huge premiums if they are looking to add a top AI stock to their portfolios right now.\n\nHowever, there's one company that's not just trading at an extremely attractive valuation, but is growing at an incredible pace as well thanks to AI: Micron Technology (MU 3.26%). Let's see why investors would do well to buy this stock now.\n\nData centers, smartphones, and computers are fueling this chipmaker's terrific growth\n\nMicron Technology manufactures and sells memory and storage chips that are deployed in AI graphics cards, personal computers (PCs), and smartphones. This makes the company one of the best bets on the secular growth of the AI hardware market.\n\nAfter all, AI chips used in data centers are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), since they can provide substantially higher bandwidth and lower latency. These properties allow HBM chips to quickly transport a lot of data in comparison to legacy memory chips, making them ideal for tackling AI workloads.\n\nMicron management points out that the company has \"deep relationships with practically every major customer of HBM.\" Third-party reports suggest the same, indicating that Micron sells its HBM to the top four AI chipmakers that produce both GPUs and custom AI processors. The company is reportedly looking to corner a fourth of the HBM market by the end of the year, and that could translate into a nice increase in Micron's revenue and earnings.\n\nAfter all, the HBM market's revenue is expected to almost double in 2025, generating $35 billion in sales, per Micron's estimates. What's more, the HBM market's revenue is expected to hit $100 billion by 2030. Assuming Micron can sustain a 25% share of this space, HBM alone could contribute around $25 billion to its top line after five years (based on the $100 billion revenue estimate mentioned earlier).\n\nThat would give Micron's growth a big boost, considering that the company has generated just under $34 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. Meanwhile, additional growth is likely to come from the PC and smartphone markets, where the demand for memory is increasing on account of a bump in the average dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) content, thanks to AI.\n\nFor instance, the mobile DRAM market's revenue could jump sixfold over the next decade, generating more than $636 billion in revenue, as AI and machine learning (ML) applications will lead to an increase in the amount of compute memory required in smartphones. Importantly, this isn't where Micron's list of catalysts ends.\n\nThe company says that it occupied the second spot in the data center solid-state drive (SSD) market in the first quarter. Again, this could turn out to be a huge positive for Micron in the future, as the data center SSD market's size is expected to grow by over 7x through 2033 from last year's levels.\n\nIn all, it is easy to see that Micron has solid secular growth opportunities that could help it remain a top growth stock in the long run, and that's why buying the stock right now is a great idea, considering its valuation.\n\nThe biggest reason to buy Micron stock hand over fist\n\nConsensus estimates are expecting a 6x jump in Micron's earnings in the current fiscal year, which will end next month. This astronomical growth can be attributed to skyrocketing memory prices caused by tremendous end-market demand -- fueled by AI -- in the multiple areas discussed. What's more, Micron is expected to clock a 54% jump in earnings in the next fiscal year as well.\n\nThe good part is that investors can buy Micron stock at just 22 times earnings. That's a steal, considering that the U.S. technology sector has an average earnings multiple of 51. Another thing worth noting here is that Micron is undervalued when we take into account its long-term earnings growth potential.\n\nThe stock has a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.15, based on its five-year projected earnings growth, per Yahoo! Finance. The PEG ratio is a forward-looking valuation metric that's calculated by dividing a stock's earnings multiple by its estimated annual earnings growth rate over the next five years. A reading of less than 1 means that a stock is undervalued when its future growth is considered.\n\nMicron's PEG ratio suggests that it is significantly undervalued. So, this AI stock is a no-brainer buy right now, as the remarkable growth that it has been clocking of late seems here to stay for a long time.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:06:34.496262+00:00"}

Micron has transformed itself from a cyclical memory producer into an AI infrastructure player.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/16/this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-has-quietly/", "published_at": "2025-07-16T22:05:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Semiconductor giant Nvidia continues to be a Wall Street favorite -- and for all the right reasons. The company's transition from a prominent GPU company to a full-stack artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure provider has been genuinely exceptional. Its full-stack solution includes its Hopper and Blackwell architecture chips, AI-optimized networking interconnections, and a robust software ecosystem. As cloud services providers and enterprises invest heavily in building and expanding their AI infrastructure, Nvidia is well positioned to benefit.\n\nAs of July 10, Nvidia's shares were up 22.2% in 2025. However, a few AI-powered stocks that are less famous have significantly outperformed it year to date. Among them is Micron Technology (MU 3.26%), which is up 46.2% in 2025. While many investors appreciate this business, few seem to understand all the growth catalysts that will drive its share price performance.\n\nWhere Micron's growth will come from\n\nAI is fundamentally transforming Micron's business model and its growth trajectory. In its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ended May 29), the company's data center revenues more than doubled year over year and reached record levels, as high bandwidth memory (HBM) and storage are becoming increasingly critical for supporting complex AI workloads and applications. Micron's HBM revenues were up by around 50% sequentially, and the business has reached an annual run rate of more than $6 billion.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence has estimated that from 2023 to 2033, the HBM chip market will grow at a compound annual rate of 42%, from $4 billion to $130 billion. That exceptionally rapid growth outlook is based on the fact that increasingly complex AI models require higher amounts of low-latency memory, and the expectation that many enterprises will transition from high-performance computing to advanced AI applications.\n\nTo capitalize on this opportunity, Micron has been actively shifting more of its production capacity to advanced HBM architectures that offer higher memory capacity and bandwidth. With Micron being one of the only three global HBM providers (SK Hynix and Samsung are the other two), the company expects its HBM market share to be equal to its DRAM share by the second half of 2025.\n\nMicron is also seeing strong momentum in the market for data center and client SSDs (solid state drives). It recently became the No. 2 brand in data center SSDs for the first time. Additionally, the company stands to benefit from increasing memory demand in the PC segment, fueled by a Windows 11 upgrade cycle and the growing adoption of AI-enabled PCs across the world.\n\nTechnology leadership and manufacturing expansion\n\nMicron's 1-gamma DRAM technology node leverages the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology -- extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which uses shorter wavelengths of light to pattern integrated circuits on silicon wafers. That allows each feature of a chip to be smaller, meaning more transistors can be squeezed onto each chip. For Micron, applying this advanced technology has led to a 30% improvement in bit density (higher memory storage in the same physical space), a 20% reduction in power consumption, and as much as 15% higher performance (faster data movement) compared to its previous 1-beta node technology.\n\nThe company is also planning to invest about $200 billion in expanding its U.S. footprint over the next 20-plus years -- putting $150 billion into its manufacturing infrastructure and $50 billion into research and development.\n\nThe story of the numbers\n\nMicron Technology delivered a stellar performance in its fiscal third quarter, with record revenues of $9.3 billion (up 37% year over year) and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.91 (up 200%). Both figures topped the company's guidance and Wall Street's consensus estimates.\n\nFor its current quarter, Micron is guiding for revenues in the range of $10.4 billion to $11 billion, and a gross margin in the range of 41% to 43%.\n\nDespite the stock's 46% gain year to date (at the time of this writing), there seems to be a disconnect between its share price and the company's fundamentals. The stock trades at just 22.5 times trailing earnings and 11.8 times forward earnings -- a significant discount to the Nasdaq-100 price-to-earnings ratio of 33.9.\n\nWhile that low P/E may be due to investors' recognition of the memory industry's well-established cyclicality and their skepticism about the sustainability of AI-driven memory demand, the degree to which the stock is being discounted for that seems excessive. Micron is gradually transforming from a commodity memory producer to a leading AI infrastructure player. The company has already entered into HBM contracts with some key clients that provide pricing transparency and demand visibility not seen in traditional memory contracts. In light of all that, the company may soon witness a valuation multiple expansion that drives up its share price.\n\nConsidering these catalysts, Micron seems like an appealing stock pick now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:06:41.816458+00:00"}

The move comes as part of the firm’s wider coverage launch on U.S. semiconductor capital equipment, storage, and foundry sectors.\n\nGoldman Sachs Initiates Micron (MU) with a Neutral Rating\n\nIn a note to investors, Goldman analysts described the semiconductor capital equipment industry as being in a “mid-cycle” phase, marked by a mix of supportive and challenging forces. The firm expects revenue across the sector to remain relatively stable through 2026, with limited upside catalysts in the near term.\n\nMicron, a leading player in the memory and storage market, sits at the center of several key industry trends. Goldman sees signs of an eventual recovery in the NAND flash memory market, a segment that has faced pricing and demand pressures in recent years. The firm projects a rebound in NAND into 2026, offering a potential boost for Micron over the long term.\n\nDespite some optimism, Goldman’s analysts believe the current environment presents more downside than upside risk overall, prompting the Neutral stance. However, they also noted that China may be more of a growth opportunity than a threat for U.S. semiconductor firms, given rising domestic demand.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

ASML's management cited \"increasing uncertainty driven by macro-economic and geopolitical developments,\" including the potential for new U.S. tariffs.\n\nAs an industry bellwether, a company whose performance is seen as an indicator of the entire sector's health, ASML's comments are a key signal of future capital spending.

These announcements came ahead of the broader July 9th expiration of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which failed to produce comprehensive trade deals with most nations. This action against two major trading partners, coupled with the ongoing threat of further tariffs on countries associated with the BRICS bloc, injected significant uncertainty and apprehension into global markets.

While valuation is elevated by traditional metrics at 39x forward earnings, it is still below its median valuation and with the company's combination of growth, profitability, and unmatched market positioning makes it difficult to bet against, even at these levels.\n\nThe numbers still justify investor enthusiasm: revenue is projected to grow at a robust ~30% annual rate over the next several years, while earnings are expected to rise in lockstep, reflecting Nvidia's industry leadership and exceptional operating leverage. The company's gross margins remain world-class, and its innovation pipeline, from Blackwell chips to next-gen software platforms keeps it at the center of the AI arms race.\n\nDespite its massive run and $4 trillion market cap milestone, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the AI and data center ecosystem, and its long-term growth story is far from over. The company continues to lead in AI compute infrastructure, with its GPUs and networking platforms forming the backbone of nearly every major AI deployment—whether in hyperscale cloud, enterprise, or research.\n\nAs demand surges for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), DRAM, and advanced NAND solutions in AI data centers, Micron stands to benefit in a big way. And with shares still trading at a significant discount to many AI peers and growth forecasts, Micron may represent one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the entire semiconductor space.\n\nMicron Technology is a crucial but often underappreciated player in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia powers the compute side of AI workloads, Micron is a leader in memory and storage and key components that are becoming increasingly critical to support the massive data demands of AI training and inference. This is becoming obvious as Micron's sales and earnings are accelerating higher in recent quarters.\n\nHowever, with Nvidia's stock soaring to such extreme heights, some investors may be wondering: are there other AI stocks with considerable upside opportunity?\n\nNvidia just hit a staggering $4 trillion market cap, cementing its position as the most dominant force in the AI hardware space. It's an incredible milestone and one that reflects the company's overwhelming leadership in GPUs, data center infrastructure, and the broader AI compute stack. Nvidia remains a compelling long-term investment, and there's little reason to doubt its continued growth as AI adoption expands across industries.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy Micron Technology Stock Is a Buy\n\nWhile much of the spotlight in AI has gone to the likes of Nvidia, Micron Technology is quietly emerging as a powerful beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure boom. As a global leader in memory and storage, Micron provides the high-bandwidth DRAM and advanced NAND essential for training and running large AI models. Its leadership in the memory market, where it competes alongside Samsung and SK Hynix, positions the company as a critical supplier in the accelerating data center buildout.\n\nMicron's fundamentals are beginning to reflect this momentum. The stock has attracted significant institutional buying year-to-date, and the rebound off the April correction has been particularly strong, signaling a pickup in price momentum and investor conviction. With AI demand surging and memory pricing firming, sales are expected to jump 46% this year and 33% next year, while earnings are projected to surge over 500% this year and grow another 58% in 2026.\n\nAlthough Micron currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it's worth noting that analyst sentiment has turned increasingly bullish, with earnings estimates revised higher by 12% for the current year and 14% for next year.\n\nEven with this rapid growth, Micron trades at just 16x forward earnings—a reasonable multiple for a company delivering breakout results in one of the hottest corners of the semiconductor sector.\n\nMicron Stock is a Non-Consensus AI Opportunity\n\nWhile Nvidia continues to dominate headlines and attract the bulk of investor capital in the AI space, Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, improving sentiment, and compelling valuation, all while flying under the radar. Its critical role in supplying the memory infrastructure that underpins AI models puts it in the center of one of the most powerful secular trends in technology today.\n\nFor investors looking to diversify their AI exposure beyond the obvious names, Micron represents a high-quality, underappreciated way to play the next leg of the AI buildout.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

It’s an incredible milestone and one that reflects the company’s overwhelming leadership in GPUs, data center infrastructure, and the broader AI compute stack. Nvidia remains a compelling long-term investment, and there's little reason to doubt its continued growth as AI adoption expands across industries.\n\nHowever, with Nvidia’s stock soaring to such extreme heights, some investors may be wondering: are there other AI stocks with considerable upside opportunity?\n\nMicron Technology (MU) is a crucial but often underappreciated player in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia powers the compute side of AI workloads, Micron is a leader in memory and storage and key components that are becoming increasingly critical to support the massive data demands of AI training and inference. This is becoming obvious as Micron’s sales and earnings are accelerating higher in recent quarters.\n\nAs demand surges for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), DRAM, and advanced NAND solutions in AI data centers, Micron stands to benefit in a big way. And with shares still trading at a significant discount to many AI peers and growth forecasts, Micron may represent one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the entire semiconductor space.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCan Investors Still Buy Nvidia Shares?\n\nDespite its massive run and $4 trillion market cap milestone, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the AI and data center ecosystem, and its long-term growth story is far from over. The company continues to lead in AI compute infrastructure, with its GPUs and networking platforms forming the backbone of nearly every major AI deployment—whether in hyperscale cloud, enterprise, or research.\n\nThe numbers still justify investor enthusiasm: revenue is projected to grow at a robust ~30% annual rate over the next several years, while earnings are expected to rise in lockstep, reflecting Nvidia’s industry leadership and exceptional operating leverage. The company’s gross margins remain world-class, and its innovation pipeline, from Blackwell chips to next-gen software platforms keeps it at the center of the AI arms race.\n\nWith shares continuing to print new all-time highs, price momentum is firmly on Nvidia’s side. While valuation is elevated by traditional metrics at 39x forward earnings, it is still below its median valuation and with the company’s combination of growth, profitability, and unmatched market positioning makes it difficult to bet against, even at these levels.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:06:59.556220+00:00"}

All I've been able to learn is that StreetInsider.com has a very short write-up today advising that Edgewater thinks demand and pricing for computer memory in the first half of 2025 was \"better\" than...something. Maybe better than last year. Maybe better than Edgewater was expecting. Maybe better than what other analysts were forecasting.\n\nNow the bad news: Demand and pricing will be \"sub seasonal\" in the second half of this year, says Edgewater, and with a \"bias lower.\" That implies things may be getting worse, not better.\n\nEdgewater says this is true for both SanDisk (SNDK 7.98%) and for its rival Micron (MU 3.26%), by the way.\n\nIs SanDisk stock a sell?\n\nSo how much should this all worry you, if you own SanDisk stock?\n\nQuite a lot, at least in the short term. SanDisk was already unprofitable, with losses amounting to $1.5 billion over the last 12 reported months. Investors were already braced for bad news this year, with analysts forecasting losses of $1.4 billion. Now that number might be getting even worse.\n\nThe good news is that SanDisk is expected to turn profitable again next year, earning perhaps $607 million. That would give the stock a P/E ratio of about 11 on 2026 earnings, versus its current P/E of...infinity, based on earnings that are still negative. If the stock sells off hard on Edgewater's latest report, and if you're patient enough to wait for this to improve next year, now might be a good time to buy this cyclical semiconductor stock.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:07:01.332602+00:00"}

So far, the most I've found is the briefest of mentions, on StreetInsider.com, that the research firm says demand and pricing for computer memory in the first half of 2025 appear to have been \"better.\" (Better than last year? Better than expected? Your guess is as good as mine.)\n\nAnd that both demand and pricing will be \"sub seasonal,\" or worse than the company's historical average for the second half of a year, and with \"bias lower.\" Which would appear to mean that things will be somewhat bad, and potentially worse than investors are expecting.\n\nAlso, it's worth pointing out that Edgewater says this is true for both Micron and its rival SanDisk (SNDK 7.98%).\n\nIs Micron stock a sell?\n\nAdmittedly, this isn't a whole lot of detail, nor does it give investors a whole lot of explanation for why they might to want to sell Micron -- or SanDisk, whose stock is down 8.6%. So how worried should you be?\n\nIn the case of Micron, I'd be pretty worried. Although reported earnings of $6.2 billion (according to generally accepted accounting principles) look fine to me, the company generated less than $1.9 billion in real free cash flow over the last 12 reported months. On a $139 billion market cap, that works out to a very expensive price-to-free cash flow ratio of 74 -- which is probably too much to pay.\n\nAnd the greater the \"bias lower\" in H2 2025, the less inclined I'd be to buy Micron stock.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:07:02.866486+00:00"}

Apart from shipping PCIe Gen 6 Scorpio P-Series Smart Fabric Switches, Aries 6 PCIe/CXL Smart Retimers, and Aries 6 PCIe Smart Cable Modules, the company added Aries 6 PCIe Smart Gearboxes. Astera Labs is benefiting from strong demand for Aries and Taurus product families, both expected to grow on a sequential basis in the second quarter of 2025. The addition of PCIe 6 over Optics Technology is noteworthy. Diversification across both GPU and custom ASIC-based systems for a variety of applications, including scale-up and scale-out connectivity, is a key catalyst for ALAB’s Aries product family. Continued deployment of AI and general-purpose systems at leading hyperscaler customers is benefiting the Taurus system. Astera Labs plans to provide a broad portfolio of connectivity solutions for the entire AI rack through purpose-built silicon hardware and software to support computing platforms based on both custom ASICs and merchant GPUs is a key catalyst. The company plans to increase its research and development (R&D) investments to achieve these plans. In first-quarter 2025, R&D jumped 20% year over year to $64.6 million. Operating expense is expected to be between $73 million and $75 million in the second quarter of 2025, driven by higher R&D expenses. UA Link offers a significant growth opportunity for Astera Labs. UA Link combines the memory semantics of PCIe and the fast speed of Ethernet, but is devoid of the software complexity and performance limitations of Ethernet. ALAB expects to deliver UA Link solutions in 2026 to solve scale-up connectivity challenges for next-generation AI infrastructure. The growing proliferation of UA Link is expected to be a multibillion-dollar additional market opportunity for Astera Labs by 2029.\n\nAstera Labs ALAB shares have dropped 32.8% year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Internet Software industry’s return of 14.1% and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 7.5%. Shares of this semiconductor company have underperformed close peers, including Broadcom AVGO and Credo Technology CRDO, which appreciated 17.5% and 43.7%, respectively, YTD. Stiff competition, along with uncertainty over tariffs, has negatively impacted ALAB’s YTD performance. Astera Labs is facing stiff competition from both Broadcom and Credo Technology. Broadcom’s launch of PCIe Gen 6 portfolio, featuring high-port switches and retimers tested for interoperability with partners like Micron and Teledyne LeCroy, is a noteworthy development. Credo Technology continues to gain share in the optical segment, with a major DSP win for an 800G transceiver and the launch of ultra-low-power optical DSPs based on 5nm technology. It also reported a healthy pipeline of PCIe Gen6 AECs and retimers, with further customer wins expected to support fiscal 2026 growth. However, Astera Labs’ expanding portfolio is expected to help the stock recover in the remainder of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nExpanding Partner Base Bodes Well for ALAB\n\nAstera Labs is benefiting from a rich partner base. ALAB is advancing next-gen data center infrastructure with the introduction of a PCIe 6-ready reference design based on NVIDIA NVDA Blackwell-based MGX platform that leverages Scorpio Smart Fabric Switches for AI and cloud infrastructure. Scorpio-based solutions enable users to maximize GPU productivity through enhanced data center observability, telemetry, and diagnostics using ALAB’s COSMOS rack-scale management software.\n\n\n\nAstera Labs has showcased the first end-to-end PCIe 6 interoperability with NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPU and Micron’s NVMe SSD, with both Aries 6 PCIe Smart Retimer and Scorpio-P PCIe SmartFabric Switch. Collaboration with ecosystem leaders like Wistron expands Astera Lab’s reach into OEM and modular platforms.\n\nALAB Offers Positive Q2 Guidance\n\nAstera Labs expects second-quarter 2025 revenues between $170 million and $175 million, suggesting an increase between 7% and 10% year over year. The company expects accelerated shipments of Scorpio P-Series switches and Aries 6 retimers on a customized rack-scale AI platform based on market-leading GPUs to boost top-line growth. Scorpio revenues are expected to grow sequentially in the second quarter and should account for 10% of total revenues in 2025.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $172.71 million, indicating 124.74% year-over-year growth.\n\n\n\nAstera Labs, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAstera Labs, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAstera Labs, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Astera Labs, Inc.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which Micron falls in, has gained 9.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMicron is expected to post earnings of $2.51 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +112.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +23.5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.77 points to a change of +497.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +11.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.22 indicates a change of +57.4% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +13.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:07:22.700997+00:00"}

And Micron (MU 3.26%) has been one of the top performers in the sector.\n\nThe memory chipmaker has continued to deliver strong growth, especially in artificial intelligence (AI) and the data center. It has also benefited from a return in overall bullishness among investors as the stock rose 46% through the first six months of 2025, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAs you can see from the chart below, the stock overcame a sharp drop in April to come roaring back in May and June.\n\nMicron bounces back\n\nMicron is one of the more cyclically sensitive chip stocks, as the memory category is known for its price swings and inventory gluts, according to the economic cycle and sector-level metrics. For that reason, it trades at a substantial discount to most of the semiconductor sector, despite solid growth. Currently, it's valued at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22 and a forward P/E of just 10.\n\nMicron stock jumped in May and June as enthusiasm for the AI trade returned, with concerns about the trade war cooling. Nvidia, which is now Micron's biggest customer, has since returned to all-time highs, nearly doubling off its low in April, and Micron delivered a strong round of results.\n\nMicron's revenue rose 37% year over year to $9.3 billion, and adjusted earnings per share soared from $0.62 to $1.91 as its margins also significantly improved.\n\nThe company posted particularly strong results in the data center segment, which now makes up more than half of its revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled from the quarter a year ago, and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) revenue grew nearly 50% sequentially.\n\nMicron stock was mostly unchanged on the news, as expectations for the strong growth seemed to be baked into the previous surge.\n\nWhat's next for Micron\n\nAfter the surge through May and June, the stock has traded flat over the last couple of weeks. While Micron's growth will rely on continued demand for AI-related components, the company also benefits from being the only U.S. manufacturer of memory chips at a time when the federal government is pushing for the reshoring of such industries, making it strategically valuable. Micron was also awarded $6.6 billion as part of the CHIPS Act.\n\nGiven its attractive valuation, there should be more upside for Micron stock, even with its cyclical history.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:07:26.214756+00:00"}

Deutsche Bank was more cautious here, saying it sees “fewer content-per-application growth drivers than we do in DRAM” and a less favorable market backdrop.\n\nDespite a 48% year-to-date rally in MU shares, the firm sees room to run.\n\n“We view current levels as still offering attractive upside,” analysts wrote, adding that the stock trades at just ~9x 2026 earnings. “We base our $150 P/T on ~11x our CY26E EPS of $14.00, in-line with the company’s 5-year median P/E multiple.”\n\nRelated articles\n\nMicron: Deutsche Bank bullish as current levels still offer ’attractive upside’\n\nMarket tolerance could embolden Trump to hold firm on tariffs, says Wolfe\n\nDrone stocks rally on report of new manufacturing push", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:07:28.148527+00:00"}

Uber stock has been riding a strong uptrend and remains one of the best-performing names in the S&P 500 year-to-date, currently ranking sixth. With momentum on its side, a bullish fundamental backdrop, and long-term disruption potential, Uber shares look like a high-conviction opportunity for investors.\n\nFundamentally, Uber’s story has shifted dramatically. After years of operating losses, the company is now generating meaningful profits and robust free cash flow. Shares trade at 33x forward earnings, which appears reasonable given Uber’s earnings per share are forecast to grow at a rapid 27.2% annual clip over the next three to five years. With a business model that benefits heavily from scale, Uber’s operating leverage could accelerate even further as automation takes hold and cost efficiencies compound.\n\nUber is emerging as the front-runner in the race toward a distributed, automated transportation network. The company’s vision to integrate autonomous vehicles into its platform could drastically improve efficiency and margins over time. Currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) , Uber is enjoying a wave of improving analyst sentiment, driven by both profitability milestones and longer-term automation potential.\n\nIn my view, these companies are leading indicators as to where these secular trends and the broader market will head. As their respective megatrends continue to accelerate, I expect UBER, COIN, and MU to remain on the cutting edge and continue delivering strong returns for investors.\n\nThe following companies stand out as top opportunities heading into the second half of 2025. Each stock is tied to a high-growth secular theme, is showing notable market outperformance, and is supported by rising earnings forecasts and increasingly bullish analyst sentiment.\n\nOf course, even the strongest bull markets experience pullbacks, brief corrections and volatility that can shake out weak hands. But these pauses, as we've seen this year, are often just that: pauses in a larger uptrend.\n\nWhile financial headlines often dwell on risk, uncertainty, and macro noise, savvy investors know we’re living through one of the most exciting and profitable periods in market history. From autonomous vehicles and digital assets to the exponential growth of AI and the broader digital economy, the technological megatrends shaping today’s markets are powerful and enduring.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicron Technology: Quiet AI Stock with Explosive Growth\n\nMicron Technology is quietly emerging as one of the most important players in the AI infrastructure boom. While it doesn’t grab headlines like Nvidia or AMD, Micron provides the critical high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and DRAM solutions that fuel the performance of AI accelerators and data center servers.\n\nOver the past three months, Micron shares have surged, reflecting growing investor recognition of its essential role in the AI supply chain. The stock has shown powerful momentum, and the sharp correction it and the industry suffered in April, driven largely by fears over tariffs and trade tensions, now looks like a cyclical bottom in the semiconductor sector.\n\nMicron's fundamentals are also turning sharply higher. Analysts project sales will rise an impressive 46.5% this year and another 33% in 2026. On the bottom line, earnings are expected to soar more than 500% this year and climb another 57.4% next year. Despite this dramatic earnings inflection, the stock remains reasonably valued at just 16x forward earnings, a discount to many peers in the semiconductor space, especially considering Micron’s strategic importance in the AI hardware stack.\n\nWith technical momentum accelerating, long-term AI tailwinds at its back, and a valuation that still leaves room for multiple expansion, Micron looks like a powerful way to play the next leg of the AI-driven semiconductor cycle through 2025.\n\nCoinbase Global: Stock Approaching Break Out Level\n\nCoinbase Global, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, continues to benefit from renewed interest in digital assets, this time from institutional players. Major developments like The Genius Act and the growing adoption of stablecoins have added fresh momentum to the space, positioning Coinbase at the center of the evolving crypto-financial system.\n\nDespite operating in a volatile and highly scrutinized sector, Coinbase has maintained its leadership and relevance. It’s the go-to platform for both retail and institutional investors in the US, offering exposure to crypto trading, custody, staking, and blockchain infrastructure. While the stock trades at a premium valuation, that premium reflects its unique position in a market poised for long-term disruption and rapid growth.\n\nTechnically, the chart is showing real strength. COIN is forming a large bullish continuation pattern just beneath its all-time highs. A decisive move above the $365 resistance level could spark a breakout rally, potentially driving the stock into uncharted territory. With crypto sentiment improving and regulatory clarity taking shape, Coinbase may be on the verge of a significant new leg higher.\n\nShould Investors Buy Shares in UBER, MU and COIN?\n\nIn a market increasingly defined by transformational technologies, Uber, Micron, and Coinbase stand out not just as trend followers, but as core enablers of the future. Each company is deeply embedded in a powerful secular growth theme, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, and digital finance, and all three are showing both technical strength and accelerating fundamentals.\n\nFor investors looking to position for long-term tech-driven growth through the rest of 2025 and beyond, these three names deserve a serious look.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

(NASDAQ:MU) is a leading manufacturer of solid-state drives (SSDs), flash memory, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), among other memory and data storage products. Being one of the biggest producers of DRAM and NAND flash memory, its components are essential to various electronic devices.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

From autonomous vehicles and digital assets to the exponential growth of AI and the broader digital economy, the technological megatrends shaping today’s markets are powerful and enduring.\n\nOf course, even the strongest bull markets experience pullbacks, brief corrections and volatility that can shake out weak hands. But these pauses, as we've seen this year, are often just that: pauses in a larger uptrend.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER), Coinbase Global (COIN), and Micron Technology (MU) stand out as top opportunities heading into the second half of 2025. Each stock is tied to a high-growth secular theme, is showing notable market outperformance, and is supported by rising earnings forecasts and increasingly bullish analyst sentiment.\n\nIn my view, these companies are leading indicators as to where these secular trends and the broader market will head. As their respective megatrends continue to accelerate, I expect UBER, COIN, and MU to remain on the cutting edge and continue delivering strong returns for investors.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUber Technologies: Leading Automated Vehicle Stock\n\nUber is emerging as the front-runner in the race toward a distributed, automated transportation network. The company’s vision to integrate autonomous vehicles into its platform could drastically improve efficiency and margins over time. Currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Uber is enjoying a wave of improving analyst sentiment, driven by both profitability milestones and longer-term automation potential.\n\nFundamentally, Uber’s story has shifted dramatically. After years of operating losses, the company is now generating meaningful profits and robust free cash flow. Shares trade at 33x forward earnings, which appears reasonable given Uber’s earnings per share are forecast to grow at a rapid 27.2% annual clip over the next three to five years. With a business model that benefits heavily from scale, Uber’s operating leverage could accelerate even further as automation takes hold and cost efficiencies compound.\n\nThe technical setup is equally impressive. Uber stock has been riding a strong uptrend and remains one of the best-performing names in the S&P 500 year-to-date, currently ranking sixth. With momentum on its side, a bullish fundamental backdrop, and long-term disruption potential, Uber shares look like a high-conviction opportunity for investors.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:07:39.145259+00:00"}

In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported capital expenditures of $288 million, a $100 million sequential increase. LRCX stated that a major part of this increase in capital spending was for a land purchase in India for its planned lab expansions.\n\n\n\nLam Research already has a significant presence in India with an engineering center that focuses on software development and hardware engineering. However, the company announced earlier this year that it is set to build a manufacturing facility in India with an investment of more than $1.2 billion.\n\n\n\nOver the last few years, Lam Research has executed its broader strategy to build a flexible supply chain and manufacturing network across the United States and Asia. This strategy enables LRCX to stay close to its consumers, allowing the company to optimize its global operations in response to tariffs and trade restrictions. A manufacturing facility in India will enable Lam Research to navigate smoothly during a highly uncertain and unstable geopolitical scenario.\n\n\n\nLRCX’s global footprint of its factories expands across the United States, Austria, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Korea. Expansion in India will provide the required flexibility to adjust its production as and when needed.\n\n\n\nAs trade tensions rise and semiconductor supply chains face increased scrutiny, Lam Research’s India expansion could provide a strategic hedge against future disruptions. The investment also supports LRCX’s long-term research and development roadmap, enabling it to further expand its global manufacturing footprint.\n\n\n\nCurrently, India’s role in Lam Research’s operations is still evolving. The company’s ability to diversify production and service customers worldwide could strengthen its competitive position in an increasingly complex market environment.\n\nIndia Attracts More Semiconductor Players\n\nLam Research is not the only semiconductor company that is expanding its presence in India. Applied Materials AMAT and Micron Technology MU have also announced their investment plan for the country.\n\n\n\nApplied Materials is investing $400 million over four years in a new engineering center in India, with the potential to support more than $2 billion in planned investments.

It may not have been easy to hold on to MU for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nMicron's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Micron's main business drivers.\n\nIdaho-based Micron Technology has established itself as one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions.\n\n\n\nThrough global brands, namely Micron, Crucial and Ballistix, Micron manufactures and markets high-performance memory and storage technologies including Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), NAND flash memory, NOR Flash, 3D XPoint memory and other technologies. Its solutions are used in leading-edge computing, consumer, networking and mobile products.\n\n\n\nA major portion of the revenues is derived from DRAM sales. The company's mission is to be the most efficient and innovative global provider of semiconductor memory solutions.\n\n\n\nMicron reported revenues of $25.1 billion in fiscal 2024. The company has four reportable segments:\n\n\n\nCompute and Networking Business Unit (CNBU): The unit comprises of DRAM and NOR Flash products that are sold to the computer, networking, graphics, and cloud server markets, and NAND Flash products which are sold into the networking market. CNBU delivered revenues of $9.51 billion (38% of total revenues) in fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nMobile Business Unit (MBU): The unit comprises Micron’s discrete DRAM, discrete NAND and managed NAND (including eMMC and universal flash storage (UFS) solutions) products that are sold to smartphone and other mobile-device markets. MBU generated revenues of $6.35 billion (25%) in fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nStorage Business Unit (SBU): The unit accounts for solid state drives (SSDs) and component-level solutions sold into enterprise and cloud, client and consumer storage markets as well as other discrete storage products sold in component and wafer forms to the removable storage markets. SBU’s revenues grossed $4.59 billion (18%) in fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nEmbedded Business Unit (EBU): The unit includes Micron’s discrete DRAM, discrete NAND, managed NAND and NOR products, which are sold to the automotive, industrial and consumer markets. EBU’s revenues logged $4.61 billion (19%) in fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nThe company struggles with intense competition from Intel, Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, Toshiba Memory and Western Digital Corporation.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:07:43.268767+00:00"}

This is in contrast with traditional DRAM, where the price can fluctuate more frequently based on current market supply and demand.\n\nKorean rival SK Hynix assumed the early lead in HBM, but Micron has been quickly catching up with leading technology and is rapidly increasing its HBM market share. Meanwhile, Samsung has been struggling with its technology, having been late in getting its HBM3 product qualified by Nvidia for the latest-generation AI systems.\n\nSamsung has long been the market leader in traditional DRAM chips, while Micron has traditionally been the third-place provider with a mid-20% market share. However, if Samsung's update -- or lack thereof -- is a sign that it continues to work out kinks in its technology, it could open up an opportunity for Micron to potentially grab more HBM market share above and beyond its traditional DRAM market share.\n\nMicron's stock is more expensive today, but it may deserve the premium\n\nMicron operates in an oligopoly of just three total HBM providers, which means if one company struggles, the other two can massively benefit. Last quarter, Micron saw near-50% sequential growth in its HBM sales, with the volume of its 12-high HBM3E memory ramping \"extremely well.\" Management also noted it had already sent HBM4 samples to customers and expects volume production of HBM4 in early 2026.\n\nSamsung also maintains it will qualify its HBM4 with Nvidia in the second half of this year. However, given the delays with its HBM3 products and the need to catch up to Micron and SK, any further delays would only open up more opportunity for Micron.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:07:44.772668+00:00"}

The company reported a gross margin of 39%. This represents an increase of 110 basis points from the previous quarter and 250 basis points above the midpoint of its prior guidance. This improvement was mainly driven by better pricing for DRAM and NAND, as well as continued cost discipline and volume growth.\n\n\n\nIn its latest earnings call, Micron noted that better-than-expected pricing was the key factor behind the margin upside. Strong sequential growth in bit shipments, a favorable product mix, constrained supply of memory chips, such as D4 and LP4, and low inventory levels in the distribution channels also contributed to the gross margin expansion.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Micron guided for further margin expansion in the fourth quarter. The company expects gross margins of 42% (+/-100 basis points), indicating an improvement of 300 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\n\n\nConstructive demand environment, along with strong demand for DRAM, higher-value DRAM and higher-value NAND products, may help in the margin expansion. Moreover, management added that tighter inventory, particularly on leading-edge and DRAM, may help sustain pricing strength into the fourth quarter, further helping Micron to keep the gross margins up.\n\n\n\nFor the calendar year 2025, Micron expects industry DRAM bit demand to grow in the high-teens percentage range, while the NAND bit demand is expected to grow in the low double-digit percentage range. While Micron’s margins have rebounded sharply from last year’s lows, the coming quarters will test whether tight supply and strong demand can continue supporting this uptrend.\n\nHow Competitors Fare Against Micron\n\nThere are no U.S. stock exchange-listed direct competitors for MU in the memory chip space; it competes with Western Digital Corporation WDC and Seagate Technology Holdings plc STX in the data storage market.\n\n\n\nMicron competes with Western Digital in the NAND market. Western Digital is a diversified storage company with a broader portfolio that includes both traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) and NAND-based solid-state drives (SSDs).\n\n\n\nSeagate is a major force in the HDD market, particularly for high-capacity storage solutions for data centers and cloud infrastructure.

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $150.72 indicates a potential upside of 25.7%.\n\nThe mean estimate comprises 29 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $25.58. While the lowest estimate of $75.00 indicates a 37.5% decline from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 66.8% to reach $200.00. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\n\nWhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.\n\nBut, for MU, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view.

In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\n\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\n\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:07:50.472774+00:00"}

But on Tuesday it gave no update on supply to Nvidia (NVDA), only saying its improved HBM products were undergoing customer evaluation and proceeding with shipments.\n\nKey rivals SK Hynix (000660.KS) and Micron (MU) have benefited from robust demand for memory chips driven by AI growth in the United States, while Samsung relies more on China, where sales of advanced chips are restricted by the U.S. and competition with local rivals is growing.\n\n\"For Samsung Electronics, the key issue remains regaining competitiveness ... Everything ultimately comes back to HBM,\" said Ryu Young-ho, a senior analyst at NH Investment & Securities.\n\nPotential U.S. tariffs also cloud the outlook for Samsung's mainstay chip and phone businesses, pressuring margins.\n\n\"It will also be difficult to raise prices immediately due to competition, making it challenging to sustain high margins,\" Ryu said.\n\nSamsung estimated an operating profit of 4.6 trillion won for the April-June period, versus a 6.2 trillion won LSEG SmartEstimate.\n\nThat would be its weakest in six quarters, down from 10.4 trillion won in the same period a year earlier and 6.7 trillion won in the preceding quarter.\n\nRevenue would likely fall 0.1% to 74 trillion won from a year earlier, the filing showed.\n\nChip profit to plunge\n\nSamsung attributed chip profit falls partly to inventory value adjustments, without elaborating. Analysts said unsold HBM chips to Nvidia may have contributed to the large inventory writedowns.\n\nThey estimated the chip division's operating profit could come in around 500 billion won, down over 90% from a year earlier, while its phone business profit may have improved during the period.\n\nSamsung Electronics shares slipped 0.2% against a 1.2% rise in the benchmark KOSPI as of 0341 GMT.\n\nIt said it plans to buy back 3.9 trillion won ($2.85 billion) worth of its shares, part of a 10 trillion won buyback announced last November.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:07:55.132795+00:00"}

Unlike its rivals, Samsung's gains have been limited due to U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China and delays in getting Nvidia certification for its HBM3E 12-high chips.\n\nHBM revenue likely remained flat in the second quarter, as China sales restrictions persist and Samsung has yet to begin supplying its HBM3E 12-high chips to Nvidia, said Ryu Young-ho, senior analyst at NH Investment & Securities.\n\nSamsung had said in March that meaningful progress could come by June, but it has declined to confirm whether the chips have passed Nvidia's qualification process. However, U.S.-based Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials) said last month that Samsung has started supplying the chip to it.\n\nWhile chip earnings are under pressure, Samsung's smartphone sales are expected to remain firm, with some buyers stockpiling ahead of potential U.S. tariffs.

Major cloud service providers (CSPs), hyperscalers, and governments have been spending a lot of money on shoring up their cloud infrastructure so that they can run AI workloads.\n\nThis explains why the businesses of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%) and Micron Technology (MU 3.26%) have gained terrific traction in recent quarters. As a result, shares of both these chip designers have clocked impressive gains in the past three months. AMD has jumped 32% during this period, and Micron stock is up 36%.\n\nBut if you had to put your money into just one of these AI semiconductor stocks right now, which one should it be? Let's find out.\n\nThe case for Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAMD designs chips that go into personal computers (PCs), servers, and gaming consoles, and for other applications such as robotics, automotive, and industrial automation. AI has created impressive demand for the company's chips in these areas, leading to healthy growth in its top and bottom lines.\n\nThe company's revenue in the first quarter of 2025 was up by 36% from the year-ago period to $7.4 billion, while non-GAAP earnings per share shot up by 55% to $0.96. This solid growth was primarily driven by the data center and PC markets, which accounted for 81% of its top line. AMD's data center revenue was up by 57% from the year-ago period, while the PC business reported a 68% increase.\n\nIn the data center business, AMD sells both central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) that are deployed in AI servers. The demand for both these products is strong, which is evident from the terrific growth the company recorded in Q1. Importantly, AMD estimates that the market for AI accelerator chips in data centers could create a $500 billion annual revenue opportunity in 2028.\n\nSo, the outstanding growth that AMD clocked in the data center business in Q1 seems sustainable, especially considering that it generated $12.6 billion in revenue from data center chip sales last year -- nearly double the 2023 revenue. AMD is pushing the envelope on the product development front with new chips that are expected to pack in a serious performance upgrade and may even help it take market share away from Nvidia.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD's consistent market share gains in PC CPUs make it a solid bet on the secular growth of the AI PC market, which is expected to clock an annual growth rate of 42% in shipments through 2028. All this indicates that AMD is on track to take advantage of the growing adoption of AI chips in multiple applications, and that's expected to lead to an acceleration in its bottom-line growth.\n\nConsensus estimates are projecting a 17% jump in AMD's earnings this year, followed by a bigger jump of 45% in 2026. As such, this semiconductor company is likely to remain a top AI stock in the future as well.\n\nThe case for Micron Technology\n\nMicron Technology manufactures and sells memory chips that are used for both computing and storage purposes, and the likes of AMD and Nvidia are its customers. In fact, just like AMD, Micron's memory chips are used in AI accelerators such as GPUs and custom processors, PCs, and the smartphone and automotive end markets.\n\nMicron has been witnessing outstanding demand for a type of chip known as high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is known for its ability to transmit huge amounts of data at high speeds. This is the reason why HBM is being deployed in AI accelerators, and the demand for this memory type is so strong that the likes of Micron have already sold out their capacity for this year.\n\nNot surprisingly, Micron is ramping up its HBM production capacity, and it's going to increase its capital expenditure to $14 billion in the current fiscal year from $8.1 billion in the previous one. The company's focus on improving its HBM production capacity is a smart thing to do from a long-term perspective, as this market is expected to grow to $100 billion in annual revenue by 2030, compared to $35 billion this year.\n\nMicron's memory chips are used in PCs and smartphones as well. Apart from the growth in unit volumes that AI-enabled PCs and smartphones are expected to create going forward, the amount of memory going into these devices is also expected to increase. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra remarked on the company's latest earnings conference call:\n\nAI adoption remains a key driver of DRAM content growth for smartphones, and we expect more smartphone launches featuring 12 gigabytes or more compared to eight gigabytes of capacity in the average smartphone today.\n\nSimilarly, AI-enabled PCs are expected to sport at least 16GB of DRAM to run AI workloads, up by a third when compared to the average DRAM content in PCs last year. So, just like AMD, Micron is on its way to capitalizing on multiple AI-focused end markets. However, it is growing at a much faster pace than AMD because of the tight memory supply created by AI, which is leading to a nice increase in memory prices.\n\nThe favorable pricing environment is the reason why Micron's adjusted earnings more than tripled in the previous quarter to $1.91 per share on the back of a 37% increase in its top line. Analysts are forecasting a 6x jump in Micron's earnings in the current fiscal year, and they have raised their earnings expectations for the next couple of years as well.\n\nSo, Micron stock seems poised to sustain its impressive growth momentum, thanks to the AI-fueled demand for HBM.\n\nThe verdict\n\nBoth AMD and Micron are growing at solid rates, with the latter clocking a much faster pace thanks to the favorable demand-supply dynamics in the memory industry. What's more, Micron is trading at a significantly cheaper valuation compared to AMD, despite its substantially stronger growth.\n\nInvestors looking for a mix of value and growth can pick Micron over AMD, considering the former's attractive valuation and the phenomenal earnings growth that it can deliver. However, one can't go wrong with AMD either. The company should be able to justify its valuation in the long run, considering its ability to clock stronger earnings growth.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:08:06.877714+00:00"}

Or is the market overestimating its value? Find out in our full research report, it’s free.\n\nWhy Does MU Stock Spark Debate?\n\nFounded in the basement of a Boise, Idaho dental office in 1978, Micron (NYSE:MU) is a leading provider of memory chips used in thousands of devices across mobile, data centers, industrial, consumer, and automotive markets.\n\nTwo Things to Like:\n\n1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Shows Strong Momentum\n\nA company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Luckily, Micron’s sales grew at a solid 10.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth surpassed the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n\nMicron Quarterly Revenue\n\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Remarkable\n\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite, though some deceleration is natural as businesses become larger.\n\nOver the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect Micron’s revenue to rise by 37.3%, close to its 10.8% annualized growth for the past five years. This projection is eye-popping for a company of its scale and indicates the market sees success for its products and services.\n\nOne Reason to be Careful:\n\nLow Gross Margin Reveals Weak Structural Profitability\n\nGross profit margin is a key metric to track because it shows how much money a semiconductor company gets to keep after paying for its raw materials, manufacturing, and other input costs.\n\nMicron’s gross margin is one of the worst in the semiconductor industry, signaling it operates in a competitive market and lacks pricing power. As you can see below, it averaged a 27.2% gross margin over the last two years. That means Micron paid its suppliers a lot of money ($72.82 for every $100 in revenue) to run its business.\n\nMicron Trailing 12-Month Gross Margin\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nMicron has huge potential even though it has some open questions, and with its shares beating the market recently, the stock trades at 12.2× forward P/E (or $121.80 per share).

Micron's solid growth potential and attractive valuation make the stock a no-brainer buy right now, considering the potential upside it could deliver.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/03/prediction-this-growth-stock-will-skyrocket-in-the/", "published_at": "2025-07-04T00:30:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Memory specialist Micron Technology (MU 3.26%) has been delivering terrific growth in recent quarters thanks to booming demand for its chips deployed in data centers, smartphones, and personal computers (PCs), which explains why the stock has clocked solid gains of 46% so far this year.\n\nMicron released its fiscal 2025 third-quarter results (for the three months ended May 29) on June 25. A closer look at the company's numbers and guidance suggests that its rally is here to stay in the second half of the year.\n\nLet's look at the reasons why investors can expect Micron stock to deliver more upside for the rest of the year as well.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has supercharged Micron Technology's growth\n\nMicron's fiscal Q3 revenue shot up 37% year over year to $9.3 billion, while its adjusted earnings more than tripled to $1.91 per share. The numbers crushed Wall Street's expectations of $1.60 per share in earnings on revenue of $8.86 billion.\n\nMicron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra remarked on the latest earnings conference call that its data center revenue more than doubled from the year-ago period and hit record levels last quarter. This terrific growth was driven by the healthy demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips that are integrated with AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia and AMD.\n\nMicron management points out that it is shipping its HBM chips in high volumes to four customers right now, who are integrating them with both graphics cards and custom AI processors. Importantly, Micron is not resting on its laurels and is focused on further improving the performance of its HBM chips. The company claims its next-generation HBM4 chips, which will succeed the HBM3E offerings, will pack 60% more performance while reducing power consumption by 20%.\n\nThe company has already provided samples of HBM4 to customers and expects to start the volume production of this product in 2026. Micron's focus on pushing the envelope on the product development front is the right thing to do, considering that the HBM market is set to take off impressively in the long run. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that the HBM market could generate annual revenue of $130 billion by 2030. That would be a huge jump over the $4 billion revenue this segment clocked in 2023.\n\nMicron, therefore, still has massive room for growth in this segment, both in the short and long run. The strong momentum provided by the HBM business tells us why the company's guidance for the current quarter points toward another solid increase in its top and bottom lines.\n\nMicron has guided for $10.7 billion in revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, which would be a 38% increase over the prior-year period. That would be a slight improvement over the revenue growth it reported in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, Micron's forecast of $2.50 per share in earnings for the current quarter suggests its bottom line will more than double from the year-ago period's reading of $1.18 per share.\n\nThe stronger growth in Micron's earnings can be attributed to a favorable memory pricing environment. Memory manufacturers such as Micron have been increasing the prices of chips on account of solid HBM demand and supply constraints. According to TrendForce, the average price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips increased in the range of 3% to 8% in the second quarter, owing to an increase in sales of HBM, along with an improvement in the demand for mobile and consumer-oriented DRAM chips.\n\nLooking ahead, Micron management estimates that adoption of AI-enabled personal computers (PCs) and smartphones will contribute to the company's growth in the coming quarters. So Micron's catalysts are likely to get stronger as the year progresses, and that could pave the way for more upside in the second half of 2025 and beyond.\n\nA big reason to buy the stock right now\n\nWe have already seen how rapidly Micron's revenue and earnings are growing. However, the company's valuation suggests that it is extremely undervalued, considering the phenomenal growth it's been clocking.\n\nMicron has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 22, while the forward earnings multiple is even more attractive at 11. The company is on track to end the current fiscal year with adjusted earnings of $7.76 per share (based on its guidance of $2.50 per share for fiscal Q4 and cumulative earnings of $5.26 per share in the first three quarters of the year). That would be a huge increase over its fiscal 2024 earnings of $1.30 per share.\n\nWhat's more, analysts are expecting a 54% spike in Micron's earnings in the next fiscal year to $12.05 per share. If the stock maintains its trailing earnings multiple of 23 after a year, its stock price could hit $265. That would be more than double current levels.\n\nAs such, Micron's latest quarterly results should give its rally a nice shot in the arm in the second half of the year, as the market could reward its terrific growth with a richer valuation, while the projected earnings growth for the next fiscal year indicates that it could continue soaring in 2026 as well.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:08:14.799239+00:00"}

Even though the stock fell in the aftermath, there had already been a huge run-up into the earnings report, reflecting a pre-earnings surge in memory pricing.\n\nMicron handily beats, as expected\n\nIn its fiscal third quarter, Micron saw revenue grow 36.6% year over year to $9.3 billion, with adjusted non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share more than tripling to $1.91, each well ahead of analyst expectations. In addition, Micron forecast an above-consensus $10.7 billion in revenue for the next quarter, along with $2.50 in adjusted EPS, amounting to quarter-over-quarter growth rates of 15% and 31%, respectively.\n\nThe stellar results have come about due to artificial intelligence (AI), which is no surprise. Micron reported a near-50% quarterly increase in its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI training. Micron got a bit of a late start on HBM, but is rapidly catching up to market leader SK Hynix, while Samsung, the leader in traditional DRAM memory, struggles with its HBM technology.\n\nMicron management reiterated it was on track to achieve the same overall market share in HBM, as its current overall DRAM share by the second half of the year, and that it had now qualified its HBM solutions with four customers across AI GPUs and ASICs.\n\nInvestors had expected good news, especially as older-generation DDR4 prices skyrocketed over the last couple of months, while HBM prices remain fixed and profitable based on prenegotiated contracts. The DDR4 price spike won't last, however, because it's due to Micron and other memory players \"end of life-ing\" those DDR4 products for newer DDR5. Still, the long-term outlook for DRAM memory appears positive, given the massive demand coming from artificial intelligence systems.\n\nMicron looks expensive, but it may be justified\n\nMicron now trades at 22 times earnings, but since the company has been so cyclical in the past, it has usually been better to value Micron based on book value. With the stock now at 2.75 times book value, that's at the high end of its historical range.\n\nThat said, things are arguably looking better for Micron than ever before in the age of AI. HBM pricing is more stable than traditional memory and is in perpetual short supply, given that HBM is a primary bottleneck for AI systems today. Furthermore, Micron has surged ahead of its two main rivals in process technology, with management noting \"excellent progress\" on its upcoming 1-gamma node.\n\nSo while Micron's shares may look fully valued, the stock may re-rate higher if it can sustain multiple years of better profitability and less cyclicality.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:08:39.918695+00:00"}

They might not be the ones you'd expect, though the names should be familiar.\n\nSome artificial intelligence (AI) stocks inspire tons of headlines. You probably know exactly what Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) and Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) are doing in the AI space, whether their stocks are doing well or not.\n\nAnd then there's the quiet bunch. I can assure you that IBM (IBM -0.80%) and Micron Technology (MU 3.26%) do plenty of AI-related business, and that they stand to benefit from this ongoing boom in generative AI. Their stocks have been outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.13%) in 2025, apart from a couple of short-lived glitches.\n\nBut how often do you see them mentioned among the top AI stocks to own for the long haul? Not a whole lot, I bet.\n\nSo let me tell you what these tech veterans are doing to earn consistently market-beating performance this year -- without dominating the press.\n\nHow Micron is stealing the AI spotlight\n\nMicron is not the largest memory-chip maker in the world, but it has an advantage over sector leaders SK Hynix and Samsung (SSNL.F 9.01%) right now. The Idaho-based chip maker is first to market with the fourth generation of high bandwidth memory (HBM) -- a key component in the latest and greatest AI accelerator platforms.\n\nSamsung and Hynix have their own HBM4 solutions, but Micron is already shipping these chips to its most important customers. AI hardware leader Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) includes Micron's HBM4 memory on its Blackwell family of AI accelerators. Runner-up AMD (AMD 1.52%) also selected Micron's top-of-the-line memory for its next two generations of Instinct accelerators.\n\nAs a result, Micron's market share is growing while Samsung is sliding back. Now, Micron's sales are limited by the company's in-house production capacity, as the HBM chips are sold out for the rest of 2025. That's why Micron has invested $10.2 billion in capital expenses over the last three quarters, up from $5.3 billion in the same year-ago period. These costly chip-factory upgrades will be the foundation of Micron's long-term growth opportunity.\n\nSo Micron is a leading supplier of AI-grade memory solutions. The stock has gained a market-beating 47% in the first half of 2025. Now you know why.\n\nIBM's not so secret weapon: Consulting services\n\nDo you still see IBM as a one-stop shop for corporate computing needs? That would be a mistake. The company refocused on AI, cloud computing, and consulting services long before it was cool. The strategy shift led to many years of disappointing shareholder returns, but the big payoff is finally coming in. And of course, Big Blue's fortunes are built around AI.\n\nIn the recent first-quarter update, IBM posted an order book of more than $6 billion in the WatsonX generative AI service. That's up from roughly $1 billion in the year-ago quarter. That's a big jump. And here's the fun part -- only 20% of this incoming contract portfolio comes from software licenses. The rest springs from consulting services.\n\nThis is a unique business advantage. IBM's technical expertise goes far beyond its own software tools. When your company's employees need training on a new technology, or hands-on expertise from IT consultants, you're likely to look at IBM's consulting services. Yes, other tech giants can support their in-house software and services, but they're less likely to offer broad technology support.\n\nThis isn't a new trend. Before the Fool, two different employers sent me to IBM's training centers around the country to keep me up to date with networking standards and programming tools. That was 20 years ago and nothing has changed -- except IBM's heavier focus on high-value topics such as AI systems and cloud computing.\n\nIBM's stock has gained 33% in 2025, and the underlying business results were largely based on consulting services in the AI market. If you knew that five minutes ago, you were already ahead of the game. If not, you just earned an edge on most AI investors.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:08:41.620850+00:00"}

The technology sector has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years, and the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing are catalysts for this run to continue.\n\nIf you have an extra $1,000 you don't need for paying bills or reducing debt, here are two growth tech stocks that could double your money by 2030.\n\n1. Micron Technology\n\nThe growth of AI is driving a substantial increase in data center spending, including software systems, networking, and memory and storage. This is a huge opportunity for Micron Technology (MU 3.26%), a leading supplier of memory and storage solutions. The stock is up 46% year to date but has room to run.\n\nTo handle more advanced AI workloads, data centers need faster data transfer between hardware. Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) is meeting this need. Its revenue is skyrocketing, up 37% year over year last quarter.\n\nMicron has a strong tailwind behind it. Dell'Oro Group forecasts annual data center spending to hit $1 trillion by 2029, driven by AI infrastructure investments. The HBM market is expected to grow from $4 billion in 2023 to $130 billion by 2033, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nAs the leader in HBM technology, Micron should continue to grow along with the market. HBM solutions are essential to enable the full potential of AI chips in data centers. Micron is currently sold out of its HBM production for 2025 and seeing strong customer demand for 2026.\n\nWhile investors focus on Micron's history serving the highly competitive and cyclical market for traditional memory products, like dynamic random access memory (DRAM), it is significantly undervaluing Micron's opportunity in the fast-growing HBM market. HBM not only offers higher growth potential but can generate higher margins than DRAM.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Micron's earnings to reach $13.61 by calendar 2027. With the stock trading at just 10 times next year's earnings consensus, a combination of robust earnings growth and a higher earnings multiple could double the share price over the next three to five years.\n\n2. Datadog\n\nDatadog (DDOG 0.09%) is well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for software that helps companies monitor their cloud operations. The stock is slightly down year to date but has rebounded sharply after hitting a 52-week low of $81.63. Robust revenue growth and improving profitability could double the share price within the next five years.\n\nDatadog's revenue has grown at an annualized rate of about 40% over the last five years and increased 25% year over year in Q1 2025. The company's growth is tied to the broader cloud computing market, which is growing at similar rates.\n\nThe public cloud service market is valued around $600 billion, according to Gartner, and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 20% through 2028. This is a reasonable estimate for Datadog's future growth, which is seeing momentum in winning over large businesses to its cloud observability platform.\n\nLarge cloud service providers offer their own built-in cloud security and monitoring tools that compete with Datadog, but there is growing demand for a vendor like Datadog that specializes in this market. Datadog is now offering more products that meet the needs of larger organizations, such as its Database Monitoring tool, which is helping the company secure larger deal sizes. Datadog just signed 11 deals in Q1 worth at least $10 million.\n\nThe percentage of Datadog's customers using two or more services has been fairly steady at 83%. But the percentage of customers using eight or more products has nearly doubled over the last two years to 13%. If the company can keep this up, it could spell upside for its margins and profitability, which could benefit the stock.\n\nDatadog converted 29% of revenue into free cash flow last year, but Wall Street analysts expect its margin to reach 40% by 2029, bringing free cash flow to $2.5 billion. Assuming the stock is trading close to 40 times free cash flow, which is lower than its current free cash flow multiple of 58, the stock could double within the next five years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:08:43.248617+00:00"}

As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:08:51.060724+00:00"}

GPU sales have soared for both companies over the last couple of years, and in Nvidia's case, they have added trillions of dollars to its market capitalization.\n\nBut Micron Technology (MU 3.26%) also deserves recognition for its memory and storage chips, which are increasingly important for AI workloads in data centers, personal computers, and even smartphones. The company just released financial results for its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ended May 29), revealing a continued surge in demand for AI-related memory capacity.\n\nMicron stock is up 42% in 2025 already, but here's why it might still be a screaming buy.\n\nDemand for memory capacity is soaring\n\nData center GPUs are designed for parallel processing, which means they can perform several computations simultaneously and handle the enormous data sets required to deploy AI models. But these workloads also need high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which stores information in a ready state so it can be called upon by the GPU at a moment's notice.\n\nMicron's HBM3E solution for the data center leads the industry in performance and efficiency. In fact, Nvidia selected it to power its latest Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) will also use it in its upcoming MI355X GPUs. Micron is now gearing up to produce commercial quantities of its new HBM4 data center solution next year, which will deliver a 60% performance boost over HBM3E and consume 20% less power, making it ideal for next-generation \"reasoning\" AI models.\n\nMicron estimates its addressable market for data center HBM will be worth $35 billion this calendar year, and expects that figure to soar to $100 billion by 2030, so there is an enormous opportunity ahead for the company.\n\nBut some AI workloads are now being processed on personal computers (PCs) and smartphones without the need for external computing capacity from data centers. This trend will accelerate as chips become more powerful, and it's already driving up demand for DRAM (memory). Micron says AI-enabled PCs typically require a minimum DRAM capacity of 16 gigabytes, compared to 12 gigabytes for their non-AI counterparts, and AI smartphones are commanding a similar increase in capacity.\n\nMicron's data center revenue surged in the third quarter\n\nMicron generated $9.3 billion in total revenue during the fiscal 2025 third quarter, ended May 29. It was a 37% increase from the year-ago period, and it was also comfortably above the high end of management's guidance range, which was $9 billion. But the real growth story lies beneath the surface of the headline number.\n\nMicron's compute and networking segment, which is where it accounts for its data center HBM sales, delivered $5.1 billion in revenue, which was a whopping 97% increase from the year-ago period. Revenue from the mobile segment came in at $1.6 billion, and while that was down 2% year over year, it represented growth of 45% sequentially (compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2025 three months earlier).\n\nMicron's soaring revenue also led to a strong result at the bottom line during the quarter. Its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share (EPS) soared by an eye-popping 460% year over year to $1.68.\n\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter (which will end Aug. 31), Micron is forecasting a record $10.7 billion in revenue along with $2.29 in EPS, which would represent year-over-year increases of 38% and 190%, respectively.\n\nWhy Micron stock is a buy now\n\nDespite its 42% gain in 2025 so far, Micron stock is still relatively cheap. Based on the company's trailing-12-month EPS of $5.55, the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.5. That's a 55% discount to Nvidia stock, which currently trades at a P/E ratio of 50.9:\n\nConsidering Micron's HBM3E solution is integrated into all of Nvidia's latest GPUs, Micron's data center sales should grow in lockstep with Nvidia's data center sales from here. When you also factor in the potential demand from AMD for its latest GPUs, and demand for memory from AI PC and smartphone manufacturers, it's reasonable to conclude that Micron stock deserves a higher valuation.\n\nAs a result, Micron stock could be a great buy right now, especially for investors who already own Nvidia and AMD and are looking to diversify their AI semiconductor holdings.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:08:52.738913+00:00"}

The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which Micron belongs, has gained 18% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Micron is expected to post earnings of $2.10 per share, indicating a change of +78% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +24.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +450.8%. This estimate has changed +1.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.34 indicates a change of +58.3% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Micron.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:08:58.671325+00:00"}

Keep reading to learn about two of them.\n\n1. Micron Technology\n\nFresh off its latest earnings report, Micron Technology (MU 3.26%) just delivered another strong round of results in the fiscal third quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines and offering better-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter.\n\nThere was one blemish in the report, which was that pricing declined slightly on a sequential basis, which led to the stock falling less than 1% on Thursday. However, Micron still looks well-positioned to capitalize on the AI boom.\n\nIts data center business is surging, more than doubling on a year-over-year basis, pacing overall revenue growth of 37%. It also reported nearly 50% revenue growth in high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and reached record DRAM revenue, which includes HBM.\n\nMicron's margins also improved. Its gross margin jumped from 26.9% to 37.7%, and operating margin increased from 10.6% to 23.3%. Adjusted earnings per share more than tripled from $0.62 to $1.91.\n\nIn addition to its ramping financials, Micron finds itself in an advantageous position because it's the only U.S. manufacturer of advanced memory chips, meaning it's strategically important to the country at a time when the government is focused on reshoring chip production and ensuring adequate supply. Micron was awarded $6.2 billion from the CHIPS Act, and also agreed to invest $200 billion in new foundries in R&D in the U.S., though the timeline on that is unclear.\n\nLooking at valuation, Micron looks cheap. Based on its latest guidance, the stock trades at a forward P/E of less than 16, and analysts expect earnings per share to hit $12 in fiscal 2026, giving the stock a P/E of roughly 10 based on that forecast. Micron does face cyclical risk, but if the company can hit those numbers, the stock is a good bet to move higher.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAnother chip stock with significant upside potential is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%). AMD might not look undervalued, according to its trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 39, but that's actually an attractive price for the company's growth potential and momentum.\n\nAMD stock is still down by more than a third from its peak last year, but its recent results show it's growing quickly in the key data center segment, and it has emerged as the only real challenger to Nvidia in the AI GPU market. Though it's a distant second there, that's proven to be a valuable position, and is likely to earn it support from customers, as having competition for Nvidia is to their benefit as well.\n\nIn its first-quarter earnings report, revenue rose 36% to $7.4 billion, led by a 57% jump in revenue to $3.7 billion, which was driven by growth in its EPYC CPU and Instinct GPU chips. AMD's strength in both CPUs and GPUs, arguably give it a competitive advantage as well and help differentiate the company from competitors. AMD also impressed in the client segment, where revenue jumped 68% to $2.3 billion thanks to strong demand for its Zen 5 Ryzen processor. While that growth rate is likely to slow, AMD has been steadily grabbing market share from Intel, and that trend is likely to continue.\n\nThe company is also making moves to beef up its AI capabilities. It acquired ZT Systems in the first quarter to improve its expertise in servers and rack-level solutions, which it said would help it address the data-center AI accelerator opportunity, which it said was expected to reach $500 billion by 2028. It's also acquired a number of AI start-ups, which should accelerate its advances in AI.\n\nAnalysts are expecting rapid growth from the company, forecasting adjusted EPS of $5.71 in 2026. Based on that figure, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 25.2, making AMD looks like a good deal, considering its growth potential in AI and beyond.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:09:00.255811+00:00"}

One stock that still seems undervalued even after doubling since the market dip in April is Micron Technology (MU 3.26%), a leading maker of memory chips, including high-bandwidth chips that are used for AI applications.\n\nMicron is also an integrated device manufacturer, meaning it both designs and manufactures its own chips, differentiating it from companies like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices. That exposes the company to added volatility due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, but it also gives the stock more upside in good times because it can fully capture the benefit of the AI boom.\n\nComing into the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings report, the stock had been rallying alongside the rest of the tech sector as concerns about tariffs and a recession have faded since President Donald Trump announced the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and later paused them. Micron did not disappoint.\n\nLet the good times roll\n\nThe momentum continued in the third quarter as revenue rose 37% to $9.3 billion, and gross profit nearly doubled from $1.83 billion to $3.5 billion as gross margin expanded from 26.9% to 37.7%. That shows the company is benefiting from increased efficiencies as more of its business shifts to the data center sector, much of which is AI, and high-bandwidth memory (HBM).\n\nManagement noted that HBM revenue grew nearly 50% sequentially, and data center revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to a quarterly record. The company also recorded an all-time high in revenue for DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), which includes HBM revenue. And 55% of its revenue came from data center and networking sales, up from 30% a year ago.\n\nOn the bottom line, Micron's performance also continued to improve with expanding margins as adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped from $0.30 to $1.68, and operating margin surged form 10.6% a year ago to 23.3%. Again, that figure improved sequentially, rising from 22% to 23.3%, a favorable sign.\n\nThe company easily beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, and the stock initially jumped on the results after hours, but then it pulled back as the company revealed that prices were down for some of its chips.\n\nNonetheless, guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, its biggest of the year, was strong as well. The company expects revenue of $10.4 billion to $11 billion, up 38% from a year ago, and adjusted EPS of $2.35 to $2.65, up from $1.18 in the quarter a year ago.\n\nIs Micron a buy?\n\nFollowing the earnings report and updated guidance, Micron trades at a forward P/E of about 16, a substantial discount to the S&P 500 and its chip stock peers. Analysts also see earnings continuing to ramp up into fiscal 2026, forecasting adjusted EPS of $12 next year.\n\nIf those forecasts are correct, the stock certainly looks like a buy. The aforementioned pricing concerns seem to have led to a modest sell-off in the stock on Thursday following the earnings report, but the company looks well positioned to continue to benefit from growth in AI.\n\nIts biggest customer is now Nvidia, and the relationship between the two companies seems to be getting stronger. Micron was invited to present its portfolio of data center memory and storage products at Nvidia's GTC conference in March.\n\nIt is also the only manufacturer of advanced memory chips in the U.S., making it a strategically important company, and it was awarded $6.2 billion to build new plants in the U.S.\n\nThose factors, along with what appears to be a lasting tailwind in AI, should drive the company's growth for the foreseeable future. While Micron will experience another cyclical rotation at some point, it looks like an attractive buy at the current valuation.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:09:01.791293+00:00"}

You might want to wait for a price correction before grabbing this dynamic duo of top-notch AI stocks.\n\nThe stock market has recovered from April's sudden dip. From the S&P 500 to the Nasdaq Composite, the market-defining indexes are reaching fresh all-time highs almost every day. As of June 27, those portfolios had gained 12.6% and 13.6%, respectively, over the last year.\n\nAs a result, some of the best artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are running a bit hot again. I'm keeping a close eye on SoundHound AI (SOUN 0.60%) and Micron Technology (MU 3.26%) at the moment. Their stocks look a bit pricey today, but I'm ready to pounce on them in the next market dip.\n\nSoundHound AI's big promises -- and why I'm waiting for a sale\n\nI've been a SoundHound AI fan for years, and I expect big things from this company in the long haul. Voice-control systems are gaining momentum in many different markets, from in-car controls and phone-based menu systems to drive-through windows and data center operations.\n\nSoundHound AI has been fine-tuning its AI-based voice interpretation tools since smartphones were new and hot. These days, the company offers agentic AI, process automation, and real-time conversations. The client list includes many of your favorite consumer electronics and carmaker brands. Their long-term contracts are starting to kick in, converting SoundHound AI's billion-dollar order backlog into actual revenues.\n\nYet, I can't quite recommend this stock right now. SoundHound AI's shares posted artificial gains in a meme-stock moment in late 2024, and the peak prices are now long gone, but some lingering market effects remain. The stock is up 155% over the last 52 weeks, and it looked expensive at the start of that surge.\n\nSo, one of two things must happen before I smash SoundHound AI's buy button again.\n\nThe company could earn its lofty valuation by publishing dramatically stronger financials. Again, the beefy order backlog should generate lots of business over the next several years, but the revenue conversion process has been slow so far.\n\nThe stock could take another haircut. This could happen over time as the meme stock mania fades out or very quickly alongside a downturn in the broader stock market.\n\nI don't mind waiting for SoundHound AI's business plan to gain traction. At the same time, this stock will be at the top of my list of buying ideas the next time every high-priced growth stock takes a big hit.\n\nThe art of waiting for a better price on Micron Technology\n\nMicron enters this discussion from a different angle. The memory chip giant's stock often trades at rock-bottom valuations, but it has been skyrocketing since April's tariff-based market dip.\n\nMind you, the stock isn't exactly expensive even now. Micron's share price is up 95% from April's temporary market bottom, changing hands at a perfectly reasonable valuation of 22.8 times trailing earnings or 4.2 times sales.\n\nSo, why am I waiting for another market correction? Why not grab a few shares at today's stock price, which looks pretty fair in the first place?\n\nBecause I'm used to Micron trading at much lower valuation multiples. The company operates in a cyclical industry, tied to a mix of surprising and predictable shifts in the smartphone, data center, and PC markets. Micron investors have made a lot of money over the years by saving their buy-in cash for one of the seemingly inevitable downturns. That's the opposite of what's going on right now.\n\nYes, Micron benefits from the general AI boom, partly thanks to a close partnership with AI accelerator leader Nvidia. Every number-crunching Nvidia Blackwell card comes with several dozen gigabytes of Micron's most advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM). This close connection to the explosive AI opportunity could lift Micron's stock even higher.\n\nCall me a creature of habit; I'm just more comfortable waiting for the next price drop. Whether it springs from inflation fears or memory-chip price wars, you will almost certainly see one of those Micron buying windows open up in the next year or two. It's OK if I'm wrong, since my personal portfolio already holds a large helping of Micron stock. If I didn't have that advantage, I might consider buying a few shares at today's unusually high prices as well.\n\nYour mileage may vary, of course. I'd still save most of my cash for a rainy day around Micron's Idaho headquarters.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:09:07.523110+00:00"}

But demand for chips can be cyclical, which can lead to volatility for many of these stocks.\n\nIt's important to understand that wild swings in share prices don't tell you anything about the long-term direction of the business. Volatility can be a long-term investor's friend, providing the opportunity to buy competitively positioned companies at attractive valuations.\n\nTwo of the most volatile stocks in the chip industry over the past year have been Micron Technology (MU 3.26%) and Arm Holdings (ARM 0.83%). These high-growth businesses are meeting the growing demand for AI infrastructure in data centers and other products. Here's why they may, or may not be, smart buys right now.\n\n1. Micron Technology\n\nInvestors have a lot of choices to profit off the investment in AI infrastructure. There is tremendous demand for everything from chips, networking, and liquid-cooled servers. But for Micron Technology, the need for more high-bandwidth memory and solid-state storage (SSD) to enable faster data processing and retrieval is a huge opportunity.\n\nThe memory market is competitive, which historically led Wall Street to focus on the cyclical swings in selling prices and supply that create volatility in Micron's financials. But if you had just bought and held the stock 10 years ago, your investment would be up 540%.\n\nMicron could easily repeat that performance in the coming years. The opportunity to meet the surging investment in AI infrastructure is driving record revenue for Micron in 2025. Revenue grew 37% year over year last quarter, driven by nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter growth in high-bandwidth memory products.\n\nOverall, Micron's sales to data centers more than doubled over the year-ago quarter. However, the stock is trading at 16 times this year's earnings estimate and just 10 times next year's earnings. These modest earnings multiples indicate that Wall Street is underestimating the sustainability of Micron's growth. It's possible that Micron's revenue over the next several years could be smoother than the lumpy results in recent years.\n\nMicron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra noted that the business is on track for record revenue and solid profitability in fiscal 2025. The company is also gaining momentum with its SSD business, gaining share on competitors to become the No. 2 player in the market.\n\nAs more advanced AI workloads kick in, data centers will need memory technology for faster data processing speeds and better energy efficiency to control computing costs. Micron's growth suggests that it is meeting this need.\n\nWith Dell'Oro Group forecasting $1 trillion in annual data center spending by 2029, up from the recent $260 billion spent in 2023, Micron could be reporting more record revenue in the years to come. Its relatively modest P/E multiple doesn't reflect this possibility, making the stock a compelling long-term investment. I would consider buying shares.\n\n2. Arm Holdings\n\nTeaching computer models to think more like humans will continue to require substantial investment in greater processing power. Arm is a leader in designing and licensing central processing units (CPUs) to other chip companies and product manufacturers. In fact, you're probably reading this on a device powered by an Arm-based processor.\n\nArm's chip designs are everywhere, including 99% of smartphones sold globally, but it also has an increasing share of chips being used in data centers. Its market share in cloud computing, automotive, and other markets has been steadily increasing every year. Its revenue, which comes from licensing and royalties, grew 34% year over year last quarter to over $1.2 billion.\n\nLeading tech companies, including Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet's Google, and Microsoft, are using Arm-based chips. Nvidia's Grace Blackwell CPU for data centers is an Arm-based design, while Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are using its chip technology to power cloud services for their customers.\n\nArm's expertise in building chips that offer superior energy efficiency positions it well for strong growth in a market that can't get enough computing power. The U.K.-based company expects up to 50% of new server chips to be Arm-based this year.\n\nThis is pointing to excellent growth prospects for Arm Holdings. The reason the stock has been so volatile over the last year can be attributed to its high valuation. Arm's lucrative business of designing chips and collecting royalties on every chip shipped using its technology is well reflected in the stock right now, which is trading at 88 times this year's earnings estimate.\n\nThe stock hasn't hit a new high since reaching $188.75 in July 2024, and it may need to settle for a while longer to bring its valuation closer to other leading chip stocks. For example, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are each growing earnings at about the same rate, or faster, than Arm but trade at much lower earnings multiples.\n\nAll of these stocks, including Micron, offer investors a more attractive growth-to-value profile, and therefore offer a better opportunity for market-beating returns. I would pass on Arm stock for now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:09:13.064358+00:00"}

The bulls were initially impressed by its rapid growth, expanding customer base, and the disruptive potential of its tools, which could be customized for restaurants, vehicles, consumer electronics, and other markets. Nvidia's minor investment in the company raised even more green flags.\n\nHowever, a lot of SoundHound's growth was driven by its acquisitions rather than its organic improvements -- and it remained deeply unprofitable. It also faces stiff competition from similar voice recognition platforms, and many investors fled after Nvidia sold its entire stake earlier this year.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect SoundHound's revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 48%. They also expect its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to turn positive by the final year.\n\nThat's a promising growth trajectory, but it's still richly valued at 20 times this year's sales, so any bad news could easily sink its stock. Instead of investing in SoundHound AI, it might be smarter to invest in two other AI-oriented stocks that are on firmer ground: Arista Networks (ANET 2.57%) and Micron (MU 3.26%).\n\n1. Arista Networks\n\nArista Networks is a top networking hardware and software company. But unlike its larger competitor, Cisco, which locks in its customers with proprietary hardware and software, Arista uses off-the-shelf chips and open-source software that are compatible with a broad range of hardware. It also sells low-latency switches, optimized for hyperscale data center and cloud networks, and its CloudVision platform enables those clients to easily monitor their own cloud deployments.\n\nArista's flexible, modular, and scalable strategy made it a top choice for cloud giants like Meta Platforms and Microsoft. So, while Cisco might be a better one-stop shop for enterprise and campus customers, Arista is a more focused play on the booming cloud and AI infrastructure markets.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2024, Arista's revenue rose at a CAGR of 24%, while its adjusted net income increased at a CAGR of 30%. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 19% and 15%, respectively.\n\nThat growth should be driven by the soaring need for cloud and AI infrastructure upgrades, its gradual expansion into the enterprise and campus markets to challenge Cisco, and the rising adoption of its integrated security services. Arista's stock isn't cheap at 39 times this year's earnings, but it could still have plenty of room to grow.\n\n2. Micron\n\nMicron is one of the world's largest producers of DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and NAND memory chips. It controls smaller slices of both markets than South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix, but Micron manufactures slightly denser DRAM chips with its 1-beta process. That technological edge makes it a top choice for performance-oriented cloud and AI companies.\n\nMicron is a cyclical company that follows the memory market's boom and bust cycles. Its last bust occurred in 2023, when the PC market lapped its pandemic-driven acceleration, the 5G smartphone upgrade cycle cooled, and more data centers prioritized their purchases of Nvidia's AI-oriented graphics processing units (GPUs) over new memory chips.\n\nBut from fiscal 2024 (which ended last August) to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Micron's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 23% and 148%, respectively. The company's growth is accelerating again as the PC and smartphone markets stabilize and more data center customers install solid-state drives (SSDs) and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to support the latest cloud and AI applications.\n\nThat's an impressive growth trajectory for a stock that trades at just 13 times next year's earnings. Micron is likely trading at that lower valuation because it's a cyclical stock. However, it still has plenty of upside potential in this boom cycle as the cloud and AI markets generate fresh tailwinds for its business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:09:14.744209+00:00"}

MU confirmed during its third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call that its entire High Bandwidth Memory (“HBM”) supply for calendar year 2025 is sold out. This indicates strong demand for Micron Technology’s advanced memory chips, which are essential for artificial intelligence (AI)-focused computing platforms. The company also said that it is already working with customers to prepare for HBM demand in 2026.\n\nHBM is becoming a key growth driver for Micron Technology. MU expects HBM demand to jump from around $18 billion in 2024 to $35 billion in 2025, with continued growth in 2026. Micron Technology believes that its next-gen HBM4 products, offering over 2 terabytes per second bandwidth and 20% lower power usage, will be crucial in meeting this rising demand.\n\nIn the third quarter, Micron Technology’s HBM revenues ramped up sharply. The company now expects its HBM market share to match its DRAM share in the second half of 2025, earlier than previously planned. Volume shipments of its 12-high HBM3E are underway, and HBM4 sampling has begun for 2026 platforms.\n\nThe challenge will be whether Micron Technology can scale fast enough. MU is expanding its backend manufacturing capacity and plans to bring more HBM capacity online in Singapore by 2027. Still, with HBM demand outpacing general DRAM growth, tight supply remains a risk.\n\nAt present, Micron Technology appears well-positioned in the AI memory race. However, maintaining momentum in 2026 will depend on continued execution in both technology and capacity expansion.\n\nHow Do Micron’s Rivals Stack Up in the HBM Race?\n\nAlthough there are no U.S. stock exchange-listed direct competitors for MU in the memory chip space, Intel Corporation INTC and Broadcom Inc. AVGO play key roles in the HBM supply chain and AI hardware ecosystem.\n\nIntel is developing its own AI accelerators that rely on high-performance memory like HBM. Although Intel doesn't manufacture HBM chips, its Gaudi AI chips will require a robust HBM supply, and any shift in memory partnerships could impact Micron's position.\n\nBroadcom, on the other hand, designs custom application-specific integrated circuits used in AI infrastructure that often include integrated HBM. As demand for Broadcom’s AI chips grows, it could influence how HBM suppliers like Micron allocate their future supply.\n\nMicron’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates\n\nShares of Micron Technology have risen around 49.7% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s gain of 28.1%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:09:26.630020+00:00"}

We saw strong third quarter results from Micron boosted by AI demand, so how does this factor into the broader AI trade and add just another thought in the frame of mind for some of the Nvidia investors out there as well?\n\n00:16 Dan Ives\n\nI mean, there's one chip fueling the AI revolution and that's Nvidia. And I think investors are starting to recognize we haven't even seen the biggest growth driver yet of AI. Not not just an enterprise and the use cases, but on the consumer side, ultimately autonomous and robotics. And I just, this is, in my view, it's not just four trillion, I mean, we're going to be looking at five trillion dollar market cap in Nvidia.\n\n00:46 Speaker A\n\nAnd so at what point, what's the kind of modeling in the time frame that you're kind of anticipating that that could come to fruition?\n\n00:56 Dan Ives\n\nStreet's still underestimating growth longer term. I think by 15 to 20%, that could be conservative. I think when you actually see the dynamics playing out today, remember they took China basically out of their forecast. And if you have any trade deal, a big chip on the table is Nvidia and I believe they're not going to hand that business on a silver platter to Huawei. I think right now investors are starting to recognize the growth opportunities for Nvidia and we've talked about demand to supply, 10 to one.\n\n01:30 Speaker A\n\nAnd so as we're thinking about that and you mentioned China, one of the major factors within any type of trade deal is going to be IP, that intellectual property. What is the likelihood that we see an outcome on the intellectual property front that is favorable for Nvidia and what does that do in terms of unlocking some of that addressable market?\n\n01:51 Dan Ives\n\nI think probably less for Nvidia from an IP perspective. And the bigger issue from an IP especially a lot of the software players, that's been the big issue when it comes to China. But look, there's a give and take here. And the reality is that Jensen wants that business back, he's talked about it. And you know, when you think about it, eight billion a quarter, but eventually that could be 10, 12 billion a quarter. But China, they know that there's only one chip in the world fueling AI revolution. That's the Godfather of AI, Jensen Nvidia.\n\n02:31 Speaker A\n\nYou know, we've heard, we've heard some really strong calls for even six trillion dollar market caps for Nvidia here. What is you think the the critical kind of checklist in order for us to get to that point?\n\n02:48 Dan Ives\n\nI think checklist is, and just take all the geopolitical out for a second, but I think first, it's the use cases that are now exploding. And we're seeing on the hyperscale and Microsoft, of course names like Palantir which continues to be one of our top names. Then it's the consumer piece, you know, everything Zuckerberg and Met is doing and what we're seeing with Alpha and others, because that's a whole another leg to the stool in terms of the consumer side. And then the Holy Grail, autonomous robotics, humanoids, that's not even being factored in here today.\n\n03:28 Speaker A\n\nAnd so you mentioned a few of the other things that I wanted to get to as well here. You of course are tracking Palantir and another name that's seen new record highs. What do you think is really contributing to the mindset around the trading and the thesis for Palantir right now?\n\n03:48 Dan Ives\n\nLook, I mean, they hated at 20, despised at 70, called expensive at 100, right? I mean, now the bear is 145 because as we always say, they they can't find AI and spreadsheets when they're in hibernation mode. Palantir we view as a trillion dollar market cap in the next two or three years. There is no company from a software perspective that has what they have. And I think now as they go further and further after the enterprise, as sovereigns go down the AI path, this is just the beginning of what's going to be a golden age of Palantir. And I think, look, is it expensive today? Of course, but if you look out two, three, four years, I mean, we're going to be talking about one of most transformational companies in the world.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:09:31.473708+00:00"}

They talked about different positioning that investors were taking at the beginning of the year, and really after those April lows that we saw following Trump's liberation day, where investors took some money and put it into more defensive sectors of the economy.

Management credited the results to a sharp increase in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) revenue, strong execution in ramping up new product lines, and ongoing operational improvements. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra highlighted that the company reached new records in data center revenue and that customer inventories were generally healthy, with only modest effects from tariff-related order timing. He emphasized, “Micron's strong competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue,” pointing to disciplined investments and successful transitions to newer technology nodes as central to the quarter's performance.\n\nLooking forward, Micron’s guidance is based on continued momentum in AI-driven memory demand and further progress in technology transitions.
