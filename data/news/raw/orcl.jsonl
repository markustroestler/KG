F1s have been sold for staggering prices over the years with no signs of their values slowing down. Back in 2021, an F1 was sold for a then-record $20.5 million. The example for sale this year will be available at auction until Saturday, Aug. 16, with sealed bidding.\n\nWhat makes this car unique?\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the F1, then you may be confused by the massive price. For enthusiasts who already know about the vehicle and its history, then the price is no surprise.\n\nThis F1 was formerly owned by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and since then it has had two additional owners. The car has only 6,500 miles and has been serviced regularly along with some additional upgrades. This example is chassis No. 062 and is one of seven F1s that were originally exported to the United States via Ameritech.\n\nWhat makes the McLaren F1 so special?\n\nThe F1 was designed by Gordon Murray who was the lead designer for McLaren and the Brabham Formula 1 team. Murray began designing the F1 as a concept in 1969 and it was finally brought to life in 1992. The production lasted until 1998 and only 106 models were built.\n\nThe car is powered by a 6.1-liter V12 made by BMW and it delivers 618 horsepower. The car was able to reach a top speed of 240 mph in the 1990s and still remains the fastest naturally aspirated vehicle to ever be made. The massive amount of heat produced by the engine bay caused some trouble during the design phase, so the engineers decided the only way to insulate it was with gold. The car is a three-seater as it imitates the center seating position that Formula 1 cars have.\n\nA true analog driving experience\n\nThe F1 doesn’t feature any of the modern technology that most performance vehicles have today. There is no traction control, stability control, paddle shifters, turbochargers or hybrid assistance — just the car and the driver. To this day, the F1 offers the ultimate driving experience that can’t be found in today's vehicles.\n\nRich racing history\n\nAt Le Mans in 1995, the F1 GTR finished the race in 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 13th place. The F1 LM was made in honor of the GTRs and only six models were built. The F1 was the first McLaren vehicle produced for the road so owners of the vehicle could experience the racing heritage themselves.\n\nSince this McLaren F1 is being sold in a sealed bid auction, the names and bids placed on the vehicle are private. The final sale price and the name of the auction winner won’t be announced publicly until the auction is over. Since the starting price is already a record for a McLaren F1, the amount it sells for will be sky high.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:26:29.667626+00:00"}

The company offers cloud solutions and services that can be used to build and manage various cloud deployment models.\n\n\n\nBuilt upon open industry standards such as SQL, Java and HTML5, Oracle Cloud provides access to application services, platform services and infrastructure services for a subscription. Through its Oracle Enterprise Manager offering, the company manages cloud environments.\n\n\n\nRedwood City, CA-based Oracle's software and hardware products and services include Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Java and Oracle Engineered Systems. Oracle Engineered Systems include Exadata Database Machine, Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Exalytics In-Memory Machine, SPARC SuperCluster, Virtual Compute Alliance, Oracle Database Appliance, Oracle Big Data Appliance and ZFS Storage.\n\n\n\nWith the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in Jan 2010, Oracle began selling hardware products and services, primarily comprising computer server and storage products.\n\n\n\nOracle reported revenues of $57.4 billion in fiscal 2025. The company reports its new software licenses under its new Cloud license and on-premise license segment. Further, the company merged its Cloud SaaS, Cloud PaaS and IaaS along with its software license updates and product support into Cloud services and license support.\n\n\n\nTotal Cloud services and license support revenues came in at $44 billion in fiscal 2025. Total cloud license and on-premise license came in at $5.2 billion in fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nOracle faces significant competition in most of its operational markets (database, applications, storage, cloud computing) from the likes of Dell, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, SAP, salesforce.com, Workday and Teradata.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk.

Throughout the software landscape, we have seen the AI transition process with differing results for the different companies. To help us navigate it, I'm joined by Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler Equity Research Analyst. Brent, it's good to see you. You know, we've been having this discussion over the past couple of years about AI sort of making its way through software, both as a disruptor, but also as something additional that they can sell. So, I'm curious, first of all, kind of where we are in that process, if you will.\n\n01:27 Brent Bracelin\n\nJulie, thanks for having me here. Yeah, it's, uh, it's been an interesting earnings season. We've seen a lot of volatility in software, and, uh, some good, some bad. And, and as we think about the process, the journey we are in, it really is being dominated today, the AI discussion, by AI infrastructure. It's the Microsofts of the world, the Oracles of the world. Um, uh, these are the companies, the big platforms that are, uh, standing up the infrastructure to, uh, to drive inference, uh, as folks, uh, start to offload some of these workloads, uh, to the machines, if you will. Uh, and that's where we've seen most of the upside. Um, as you think about new model releases, obviously, there's a big one last week with, uh, GPT 5, uh, from, uh, from OpenAI, Chat GPT, the new version there. Uh, a lot of volatility in these software names, uh, with the launch of that sense. I think you're seeing a continuation of that, uh, with monday today, some volatility around that. So, in the interim, at least at the app layer, I would say there's a, a lot of hyper sensitivity, uh, to any sort of kind of blemish, even if it has nothing to do with AI. Um, there's nervousness of, of, of does AI drive a disruption to the app layer? Uh, at the infrastructure layer, still lots of optimism, accelerating growth, lots of, uh, positive things happening in AI infrastructure. So, I kind of really see, uh, a split, kind of a, a two-part split here on the AI discussion, infrastructure, and then apps.\n\n04:16 Speaker A\n\nWell, and there are some, uh, software companies that are at the infrastructure layer, right?

It just takes time. I think it's very different. Enterprise spend is very different than, um, consumer. Uh, and so, uh, it's just, just going to take time is the, uh, the short answer. Um, infrastructure is happening. Apps is just going to take time before we see it show up. And so, it's kind of a, a tale of two cities today, if you will.

After years of consistent double-digit revenue increases, the momentum has faded. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues rose just 7.7% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew by only 5.7%.\n\nThis slowdown reflects cautious enterprise spending amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical pressures. Analysts anticipate that this trend will persist, with mid-to-high single-digit growth expected for fiscal 2026 and 2027.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe impact is also visible in profit forecasts. Salesforce’s EPS is now expected to witness a CAGR of 12.9% over the next five years, a big drop from the 27.8% CAGR it posted over the previous five years.\n\nThis changing growth profile shows how businesses are adjusting their IT budgets. Instead of large digital transformation projects, many are opting for smaller, lower-risk investments. For Salesforce, this means it has to adapt its strategy to stay competitive and relevant.\n\nSalesforce’s Low Valuation: Is It a Trap?\n\nLooking at Salesforce’s earnings multiple, the stock looks cheap. Salesforce currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 20.08, significantly lower than the sector’s average of 28.15.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock also trades at a lower P/E multiple compared with its top peers, including SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. At present, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have P/E multiples of 38.32, 36.17 and 33.42, respectively.\n\nWith CRM’s discounted valuation, investors might be considering buying the stock. However, considering the ongoing challenges related to its slowing sales growth, the lucrative valuations could be a value trap for investors.

From the New York Fed’s July Survey of Consumer Expectations: \"Median inflation expectations in July increased at the one-year-ahead horizon to 3.1% from 3.0% and at the five-year-ahead horizon to 2.9% from 2.6%. They remained steady at the three-year-ahead horizon at 3.0%.\"\n\n(Source: NY Fed)\n\nThe introduction of new tariffs risks higher inflation.

From AAA: \"Gas prices fluctuated slightly this past week with the national average for a gallon of regular going up by two cents to $3.16. Crude oil prices are hanging in the mid $60s per barrel, keeping pump prices steady. Supply remains abundant, as OPEC+ — a group of oil-producing countries — recently announced it will be boosting production again next month, following several other increases this year.\"\n\n(Source: AAA)\n\nFor more on energy prices, read: Higher oil prices meant something different in the past 🛢️\n\n🏠 Mortgage rates tick lower. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.63% from 6.72% last week. From Freddie Mac: \"The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to its lowest level since April. The decline in rates increases prospective homebuyers’ purchasing power, and Freddie Mac research shows that buyers can save thousands by getting quotes from a few different lenders.\"\n\n(Source: Freddie Mac)\n\nThere are 147.9 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.1 million are owner-occupied and about 39% are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to the small weekly movements in home prices or mortgage rates.\n\nFor more on mortgages and home prices, read: Why home prices and rents are creating all sorts of confusion about inflation 😖\n\n🏭 Business investment activity deteriorates.

This metric remains at levels historically associated with economic growth.\n\n(Source: DoL via FRED)\n\nInsured unemployment, which captures those who continue to claim unemployment benefits, rose to 1.974 million during the week ending July 26. This metric is near its highest level since November 2021.\n\n(Source: DoL via FRED)\n\nSteady initial claims confirm that layoff activity remains low. Rising continued claims confirm hiring activity is weakening.

From the New York Fed’s Q2 Household Debt & Credit report: \"Transition into early delinquency held steady for nearly all debt types except for student loans. Student loans saw another uptick in the rate at which balances went from current to delinquent due to the resumption of reporting of delinquent student loans. Transitions into serious delinquency were mixed across debt types: auto loans and credit card debt were largely stable, mortgages and HELOCs edged up slightly, and student loans rose sharply.\"\n\n(Source: NY Fed)\n\nWhile the rate at which debt is entering delinquency has increased, the total amount of debt in delinquency remains low, at just 4.4% of outstanding debt.\n\n(Source: NY Fed)\n\nAnd while credit card debt balances often steal headlines, it’s a mistake to say consumers are maxing out their credit cards.

Until we get more clarity, here’s where things stand:\n\nEarnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nBut growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.\n\nActions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nStocks are not the economy: There’s a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nMind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nInvesting is never a smooth ride: There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nThink long-term: For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:26:49.438224+00:00"}

Private equity firms have been making moves in Hollywood for some time, but Redbird’s stake in the Paramount deal is by far the largest to date.\n\nNow, with the deal done, Cardinale’s influence is clearly delineated: RedBird holds 22.5% of Paramount’s voting rights while David Ellison will hold 50% of voting rights and his father will hold the remaining 27.5%. Several alums of the firm are in the C-suite: Running the company alongside Ellison are two Cardinale lieutenants—Jeff Shell as President and Andy Gordon as COO. Cardinale did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nParamount also cut loose The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and settled a $16 million lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump over a 60 Minutes interview. After Skydance agreed to “ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum,” and to “root out the bias that has undermined trust in the national news media,” Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carr approved the deal on July 24. The moves garnered criticism from those who saw the Trump settlement as an indirect bribe and the cancellation of Colbert, a frequent critic of Trump, as an effort to curry favor with the president.\n\nAhead of the closing of the deal, Paramount was already showing signs of private equity-style fiscal austerity. Under Redstone, the company pushed through sweeping layoffs and parted ways with multiple top-paid executives—and Ellison has promised to find another $2 billion in cost savings.\n\nWith RedBird’s $2 billion stake in Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, Cardinale has been a key player in the 19 months of machinations ahead of the transfer of power from Shari Redstone to the Ellisons.\n\nEllison, a film producer and the founder of Skydance, is rapidly becoming a household name amid intense media coverage of the biggest deal in entertainment and media this year. His father and partner in the deal, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, has long been famous as one of the richest men in the world. Less well known, however, is the other guy behind the deal: Gerry Cardinale of the private equity firm RedBird Capital.\n\nOn Thursday, the closing of the $8.4 billion merger of Paramount Global and Skydance Media ushered in a new era for the iconic entertainment company, and a new Hollywood mogul: David Ellison , CEO of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike the moguls, creatives, and dynasties who traditionally ruled the studios, Cardinale is an outsider—a product of Wall Street, not Paramount’s backlot culture. But it’s a trait he sees as an asset. “I really think being from outside that ecosystem—or at least one foot in, one foot out—is a huge competitive advantage,” he told Fortune’s Paolo Confino in 2024. “I don’t get caught up in the headlines. I don’t get caught up in the emotionalism. I’m not running to go to the Oscars.”\n\nCardinale—a former Rhodes scholar and the kind of finance wonk who uses terms like “technological disintermediation”—suggests that it will take real discipline to position the iconic but battered studio for tech-forward survival in a ruthless streaming era.\n\nThis same unforgiving strategic discipline made RedBird formidable in sports and entertainment. “We’re an IP monetization engine,” Cardinale told Fortune last year. “That’s what we do.” At Paramount, it will likely mean leveraging the legendary Hollywood studio’s trove of movies, shows, and other IP, while cutting costs and improving efficiency. “We should be able to make movies for half the cost,” Cardinale told Puck. “We should be able to make original content for half the cost.”\n\nWhile Paramount is Cardinale’s highest-profile investment, it’s by no means the dealmaker’s public debut. The 58-year-old investor has been betting big for nearly three decades, having cut his teeth at Goldman Sachs before founding RedBird (a play on his last name) in 2014. The firm now has $12 billion in assets under management and six global offices. Despite having built a multibillion-dollar private equity empire, Cardinale previously told Fortune he rejects the term “mogul,” describing himself simply as an investor.\n\nThe finance world wasn’t always appealing to Cardinale, he told Bloomberg’s The Deal in 2024: “I wasn’t one of these Wharton kids who knew I wanted to go to Wall Street from day one,” he said. Cardinale grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs and attended Harvard University, where he rowed heavyweight crew and graduated magna cum laude before studying politics and political theory at Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship. It was while working at a Tokyo think tank that Cardinale began considering a career in finance, joining Goldman as an analyst in 1992 at the firm’s Hong Kong and Singapore offices, and later moving to New York.\n\nIn 2001, Cardinale helped persuade Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to launch the YES regional sports network, with Goldman sinking a $335 million private equity investment into the project. Cardinale saw the opportunity for the Yankees to monetize their own content—games, analysis, and original programming—rather than simply selling broadcast rights to local cable. The risky YES deal netted hundreds of millions in annual cash flow and fast-tracked Cardinale’s promotion to partner at Goldman in 2004. Eight years later, Goldman and Providence Equity sold a 49% stake in YES to News Corp at a valuation exceeding $3 billion—up from a starting valuation around $850 million in 2001.\n\nCardinale’s success with the Yankees helped prove what was to become a foundational thesis for his investment strategy empire: While platforms, formats, and technologies shift, the audience attachment to compelling IP (a storied sports team, a blockbuster movie franchise, a beloved character) persists. This durability enables monetization through endless new business models as the landscape evolves.\n\n“I’m able to look at the sports industry, and the media and entertainment industry, as ecosystems,” Cardinale explained to Fortune in 2024, speaking of his ownership of the Italian soccer team AC Milan and his efforts to replace the team’s crumbling century-old stadium with a brand-new Yankee Stadium-like arena. “And then what I do is I look for dislocations. I look for areas where there’s a need for improvement, evolution, and professionalization.”\n\nCardinale left Goldman in 2013 and founded RedBird the following year with $665 million he raised for an inaugural fund. Cardinale’s strategy at RedBird has consistently followed his formula: Acquire premium intellectual property, streamline costs, then monetize it.\n\nThis priority is reflected in the firm’s portfolio. As well as AC Milan, with its millions of global fans, Redbird purchased an 11% stake in Fenway Sports Group, the holding company that owns the Boston Red Sox, English soccer team Liverpool FC, and the regional sports channel New England Sports Network. Then, with the help of FSG, RedBird invested in NBA star LeBron James’s entertainment company SpringHill, in a $725 million deal.\n\nOutside of sports, RedBird backed Ben Affleck and Matt Damon’s film production company, Artists Equity, and acquired the production company behind the critically acclaimed British television show Fleabag and the reality game show Squid Game: The Challenge. In 2024, the firm entered the news game, agreeing to purchase the U.K. publications the Telegraph and the Spectator alongside co-investors from the United Arab Emirates, in a deal shepherded by former CNN head Jeff Zucker. Despite objections from some in the UK government about foreign influence over institutions of British media, in May, the Telegraph acquisition went through in a deal valued at upwards of $640 million.\n\nCardinale has also long backed David Ellison’s vision for Skydance. In 2020, RedBird became the second largest investor in Ellison’s company, leading a $275 million capital raise. Cardinale helped raise an additional $400 million for Skydance in 2022.\n\nFor Cardinale, content is king\n\nCardinale’s friend Bob Iger, the Disney CEO, sees Cardinale as a natural when it comes to the business of culture. “He gets the fact that great IP is the equivalent of beachfront property,” Iger told Fortune last year. “He knows that the world is in need of entertainment, and regardless of the means in which they get it, or how it’s monetized, there’s real value to it, and it’s long-term.”\n\nSo far, this ethos has paid off for Cardinale. But the road ahead for Paramount is full of formidable challenges: a declining linear TV sector, billions in debt, brutal streaming wars, and a workforce still reeling from multiple layoffs—and likely more to come with the additional $2 billion in cuts pledged by Ellison. The new leadership’s promise of “transformation” now rests on whether they can drive efficiency without eviscerating the creative core.\n\nTo do so, Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, will likely bank on Cardinale’s IP-optimizing strategy. In Cardinale’s model, every acquisition is meant to outlast market cycles and fads, thriving on operational rigor and adaptable “platform value” that eclipses the old trophy asset mentality.\n\nAnd Paramount, with its more than 100 years of lore, upwards of 1,200 film titles, and the distribution rights to thousands of other films, is chock full of platform value.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:26:51.468964+00:00"}

There are official distinctions, like S&P 500 components versus those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but there are also more nuanced groupings, like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, etc.\n\nSometimes, investors will get a little whimsical and come up with catchy names to describe red-hot, winning stocks. The \"Nifty Fifty\" was a popular term for large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nJim Cramer used \"FANG\" to describe Facebook (now Meta Platforms (META 3.16%)), Amazon (AMZN 0.08%), Netflix (NFLX 0.55%), and Google (now Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%)). It eventually expanded to \"FAANG\" to include Apple (AAPL 1.13%).\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the largest seven technology-focused companies: Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (TSLA 0.54%).\n\nBut the Magnificent Seven has its problems, which is why I'm introducing the \"Ten Titans\" -- the Magnificent Seven plus Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), Oracle (ORCL 0.47%), and Netflix.\n\nHere's why the Ten Titans is a better representation of top growth stocks than the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe Broadcom blunder\n\nThe biggest flaw of the Magnificent Seven is that it doesn't include Broadcom. It's up about 450% in the last three years, which has pole-vaulted its market cap well over $1 trillion.\n\nBased on market cap, it deserves to be included in the Magnificent Seven over Tesla. However, some folks may prefer the diversification that Tesla brings to the table with electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). And some may argue that it's redundant to include both Nvidia and Broadcom since they're both chip giants, but Broadcom has a much different business than Nvidia.\n\nNvidia generates the vast majority of its profits by selling graphics processing units and associated hardware and software to data centers. Like Nvidia, Broadcom makes AI chips, and AI is its fastest-growing segment, making up around 30% of total revenue in its latest quarter. But the bulk of Broadcom's business is not directly tied to AI.\n\nEnd markets include networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, infrastructure software, and more. In fact, Broadcom was considered a dividend-paying value stock before its recent boom -- similar to another high-yield semiconductor stalwart, Texas Instruments.\n\nAnother \"value\" stock turned growth stock\n\nNot long ago, Oracle was seen more as a mature tech stock with an entrenched legacy business and limited upside potential. Investors were more excited about hotter software stocks like Salesforce, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Palo Alto Networks. However, Oracle has completely transformed its business, integrating cloud infrastructure as a complement to its foothold in database software and enterprise applications.\n\nOracle has carved out a growing role in the cloud that is uniquely different from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle's hybrid and multicloud strategy integrates with the major cloud players, which allows customers to use Oracle's database advantages even if they're with another cloud provider.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers some advantages over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, including lower prices in some cases, more AI tools, and vertical integration with the company's other database services.\n\nSome drawbacks of OCI are that it has a smaller ecosystem with fewer preset tools for developers. However, Oracle is growing faster than the major players with a 27% year-over-year cloud revenue increase in its most recent quarter, including a 52% rise in cloud infrastructure revenue.\n\nLike Broadcom, Oracle is a great addition to the Ten Titans because it's a highly diversified company that's playing a growing role in AI.\n\nFAANG's anchor is a worthy addition to the Ten Titans\n\nNetflix was an integral part of FANG and FAANG, but it fell out of favor for a while as it underperformed the broad market. The streaming company is now worth around half a trillion dollars, which has catapulted it to the top 20 S&P 500 companies by market cap.\n\nNetflix has pulled back from its recent highs, but the stock has still crushed the S&P 500 year to date. A big reason for its rebound in recent years is its improved cost management and more purposeful spending.\n\nA major problem with the business in the past was the boom-and-bust nature of its earnings. The company would steadily grow subscribers, but it would overspend on content and have dry spells without major success.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix spent most of the 2010s being inconsistently profitable. But over the last five years, profits have skyrocketed and its operating margin continues to climb in lockstep with revenue.\n\nThe company has revolutionized entertainment and remains the gold standard in streaming, despite tons of new competition. A lot of that success comes down to its ability to balance the quantity and quality of content it produces.\n\nIt's time to add some all-stars to the team\n\nExpanding the Magnificent Seven to the Ten Titans corrects for the blatant error of Broadcom's omission and includes massively important growth stocks in Oracle and Netflix. Over the next three to five years, it wouldn't be surprising if all of the Titans were worth over $1 trillion due to their industry leadership and runways for growth.\n\nWith a combined weighting of 37.7% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans offer investors a useful way to track the top growth stocks that can really move the major indexes and keep tabs on prevailing themes that are driving the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:26:53.293996+00:00"}

SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle.\n\nThe report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as “Crescent Dune LLC” — an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nIt’s unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment. Monarch was the lone customer of Foxconn’s contract manufacturing operation at the Ohio factory, after the other three of the Taiwanese tech giant’s prospective customers went bankrupt. Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment.\n\nSoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump’s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May, Bloomberg reported that SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump’s myriad trade wars.\n\nFoxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.”\n\nThe sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy.

Management attributed roughly half this sequential drop to seasonal stock-based compensation, while the remainder stemmed from rising depreciation tied to AI infrastructure investments and foreign exchange headwinds.

The EV plant sale is a result of those efforts by the Japanese investor, they said, asking not to be named as the discussions remain private.\n\nEarlier this week, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the flagship unit of Foxconn, said it had agreed to sell the EV plant to Crescent Dune LLC for $375 million without identifying the company behind the entity. SoftBank is Foxconn’s counterparty in the transaction, the people said.\n\nA representative for SoftBank declined to comment. Foxconn did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nParticipation by Hon Hai — an investor in SoftBank’s first Vision Fund — would be a boon for SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son’s grandiose plans to be at the center of surging investment in AI-supporting hardware.\n\nThe Taipei-based company would operate the plant and use the site for its own AI server manufacturing business, Bloomberg News reported. The Ohio site may also be used for other purposes, a decision which has yet to be made, a person said.\n\nThe two companies, which teamed up to produce SoftBank’s humanoid Pepper robots a decade ago, formed a joint venture this year to build a data center and manufacturing venture in the US, investing $735 million each. It wasn’t immediately clear whether SoftBank’s investment in the venture includes the $375 million for the EV plant.\n\nSoftBank is scouting a number of potential sites to serve as a flagship for Stargate, weighing their access to water, power and telecom networks. But it’s struggled to forge a consensus with partners, leading to a slower-than-planned rollout, SoftBank Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said during an earnings call Thursday.\n\nIn January, when US President Donald Trump first unveiled Stargate, Son stood beside him and promised to deploy $100 billion “immediately” into data centers, electricity generation and other infrastructure to power AI. But the Stargate rollout stalled after economic risks stemming from US tariffs and the rise of cheaper AI alternatives such as DeepSeek made it harder to create the pricing models to secure project financing, Bloomberg reported in May.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:27:01.638515+00:00"}

In a pleasant surprise, the company's fuel cells were able to qualify for tax credits under changes made to the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill.\" Then, later in the month, Bloom inked an agreement to supply Oracle (ORCL 0.47%) data centers with its on-site fuel cells.\n\nFinally, the company reported earnings on the last day of the month; however, the slight post-earnings sell-off occurred on August 1 and wasn't captured in July's rally.\n\nBloom gets a boost from Congress and Oracle\n\nBloom makes fuel cells that can convert natural gas or hydrogen into electricity without combustion, making them a cleaner alternative than other options. Still, it was unclear as to whether fuel cells would qualify for federal clean energy tax credits, after changes were made to the existing tax law in the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nBut while some clean energy segments such as solar and wind faced increased restrictions, fuel cells remained eligible for the full investment and production tax credits for low-carbon energy until 2034, when the tax credit will begin phasing out.\n\nJPMorgan & Chase sell-side analyst Mark Strouse wrote in a note, \"As competing gas turbine pricing and lead times remain elevated, we believe the tax credits for fuel cells can push hesitant BE customers over the finish line and expect order activity to increase accordingly.\"\n\nLo and behold, on July 24, Bloom inked a purchase order with Oracle (ORCL 0.47%), its first direct order with a cloud hyperscaler for deployment of Bloom's energy servers at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) data centers. While the scale and scope of the Oracle deal weren't outlined specifically, it is the first time Bloom is working directly with a hyperscaler, and not a data center real estate company or electric utility. Thus, the Oracle deal could serve as a jumping-off point for more large deals if Bloom executes.\n\nBloom is an interesting AI play\n\nBloom's solutions may be an ideal fit for the AI age, as AI data centers have accelerated overall electricity demand beyond capacity while companies still try to limit carbon emissions and pollution. Certainly, the Oracle deal and tax credit confirmation increased the demand outlook for the company last month, with an upside that is hard to quantify.\n\nHowever, the market is now pricing in some strong growth, with the stock trading at 77 times this year's earnings estimates and 45 times 2026 estimates.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:27:03.018442+00:00"}

Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEllison noticeably perked up when asked about entertainment, sports, gaming and other aspects of the combined company. He and his lieutenants emphasized the long-term nature of the Paramount turnaround plan.\n\n“There is a lot of plumbing that needs to be fixed at this company,” said Jeff Shell, Paramount’s new president.\n\nEmployees are bracing for yet another round of layoffs since Ellison has signaled to Wall Street that he expects “to not only achieve — but meaningfully exceed — the $2 billion in real efficiencies we previously announced.”\n\nDuring his CBS News visit, Ellison acknowledged the stresses of the past year, alluding to the “60 Minutes” lawsuit indirectly. He also expressed his admiration for the news division and the importance of “fact-based journalism,” a person in attendance said.\n\nAfter brief remarks to the assembled journalists, he was given a tour of the “60 Minutes” offices.\n\nSpeaking later, Ellison said he wants CBS News to “speak to the biggest audience possible,” and he suggested that its journalism could appeal to “70%” of Americans ranging “from center left to center right,” pointedly excluding the hyperpartisan extremes.\n\nHe said he asks observers of the news division to “judge us by the work,” not external noise.\n\nHe declined to comment on the status of his previously reported talks with Bari Weiss, founder of The Free Press, about a possible deal to buy the startup and integrate it with CBS News.\n\nWhen Skydance was seeking Trump administration approval of the merger last month, the company committed to hiring an ombudsman that would review complaints of bias.\n\nShell said the ombudsman is “a transparency vehicle, not an oversight vehicle,” adding, “we’re not being overseen by the FCC or anybody else.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:27:20.509936+00:00"}

With AI momentum accelerating and strong guidance, MSFT presents a buy opportunity in 2025.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/msft-q4-earnings-beat-cloud-163200423.html", "published_at": "2025-08-07T16:32:00Z", "source": "Zacks", "text": "Looking ahead, Microsoft's guidance suggests continued strength. The company projected fiscal first-quarter 2026 revenues between $74.7 billion and $75.8 billion. More importantly, Azure revenues are expected to grow approximately 37% at constant currency (cc) in the upcoming quarter, indicating sustained momentum despite the massive scale already achieved. The Zacks consensus estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $75.38 billion, indicating 14.93% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $3.64 per share, indicating an increase of 10.3% from the year-ago period.\n\nThe standout performer was Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, which achieved remarkable growth of 39% year over year. For the first time, Microsoft disclosed Azure's standalone annual revenues, revealing it surpassed $75 billion for fiscal 2025, representing 34% growth driven by broad-based demand across all workloads. This disclosure provides crucial transparency for investors and demonstrates Azure's substantial scale in competing with Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services, Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform and Oracle ORCL Cloud. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which houses Azure and server products, generated $29.88 billion in revenues, rising 26% and beating consensus estimates of $28.92 billion. The company has transformed every Azure region into an AI-first environment with liquid cooling capabilities, positioning itself at the forefront of the artificial intelligence infrastructure wave. Management revealed that Microsoft added more than two gigawatts of new datacenter capacity over the past 12 months alone, now operating over 400 datacenters across 70 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider. The AI momentum extends beyond infrastructure, with Microsoft's Copilot products achieving significant traction. The company reported that its AI assistants, including Microsoft 365 Copilot for commercial customers and the consumer Copilot in Windows, have reached 100 million monthly active users. This rapid adoption demonstrates Microsoft's ability to monetize AI investments through practical applications that enhance productivity across its ecosystem. The integration of AI capabilities across Microsoft's product portfolio is driving higher revenue per user for Microsoft 365 commercial cloud products, creating a powerful growth catalyst.\n\nMicrosoft MSFT delivered exceptional fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate across all key metrics, demonstrating the company's dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and artificial intelligence markets. The technology giant reported revenues of $76.44 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7%, while earnings per share reached $3.65, beating the consensus mark by 8.96%. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nCloud Market Dynamics and Competitive Position\n\nThe global cloud computing market presents enormous growth opportunities, with the market expected to reach $912.77 billion in 2025 and projected to witness a CAGR exceeding 21% through 2034. Within this expanding market, Microsoft has steadily gained ground against competitors. While Amazon Web Services maintains the largest share at approximately 31%, Microsoft Azure has captured between 20% and 24% of the market, showing consistent share gains quarter after quarter throughout fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft's competitive advantages extend beyond raw market share statistics. The company benefits from deep enterprise relationships and seamless integration with its Office productivity suite, Windows operating system, and enterprise software solutions. This ecosystem approach creates significant switching costs and drives adoption of Azure services among existing Microsoft customers. Furthermore, Microsoft's early and aggressive investments in AI, particularly through its partnership with OpenAI, have positioned Azure as the preferred platform for AI workloads, attracting both startups and enterprises seeking to leverage cutting-edge AI capabilities.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has outperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector in the past six months. While shares of Oracle and Google have returned 42.2% and 5.6%, respectively, Amazon has lost 3.9% in the same time frame. Microsoft's solid 27.5% six-month performance demonstrates superior execution.\n\nMSFT Outperforms Sector YTD\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite facing competition from AWS, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud, Microsoft's differentiated approach focusing on hybrid cloud solutions and enterprise integration continues to resonate with customers. The company's ability to deliver consistent growth while operating at such a massive scale demonstrates the sustainability of its competitive advantages and the effectiveness of its strategic investments.\n\nValuation Considerations\n\nMicrosoft currently trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 12.1x, representing a premium to the Zacks Computer-Software industry average of 8.86 times. While this elevated valuation might typically signal caution, several factors justify the premium. The company's accelerating Azure growth, expanding margins, and leadership position in the AI revolution support higher multiples. Microsoft's operating margin expanded to 44.9% in the fiscal fourth quarter, demonstrating improved efficiency even while investing heavily in AI infrastructure.\n\nMSFT’s P/S F12M Ratio\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Outlook for 2025\n\nThe premium valuation reflects investor confidence in Microsoft's ability to sustain above-market growth rates and capture an outsized share of the cloud and AI opportunity. With Azure showing acceleration rather than deceleration at its current scale, and AI monetization still in early stages, Microsoft appears well-positioned to grow into and potentially exceed its current valuation multiples. For growth-oriented investors seeking exposure to secular technology trends, Microsoft presents an attractive entry point despite the premium valuation, particularly given its proven execution track record and multiple growth drivers extending well into the future.

While a few of the technology companies have been building critical infrastructure needed to power the digital economy, many others have successfully developed consumer applications that have become indispensable for billions of users.\n\nHere are three technology giants that have generated exceptional long-term returns for shareholders and are well worth considering today.\n\nBroadcom\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure giant Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%) has created an exceptional portfolio of customized semiconductor chips and infrastructure software solutions.\n\nBroadcom’s financials are impressive. The company raked in $15 billion of revenue in the second quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended May 4), up 20% year over year. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) reached $10 billion, translating into a 67% margin.\n\nThe chipmaker produced $6.4 billion in free cash flow during the second quarter and has a strong balance sheet with $9.5 billion in cash. Thanks to its strong cash generation and solid financial position, it has returned an impressive $7 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and stock buybacks.\n\nBroadcom’s AI semiconductor business (custom accelerators and AI networking) remains the key growth engine, with revenue rising 46% year over year to $4.4 billion in the second quarter. While custom accelerator revenue was up double-digits, AI networking revenue soared by more than 170% in the second quarter. Management now expects the company’s AI semiconductor revenue to grow 60% to $5.1 billion in the third quarter.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, which dominates the GPU landscape, Broadcom has become a major provider of custom processors and is currently working with three hyperscalers who are each planning to deploy 1 million AI accelerator clusters by 2027.\n\nBesides chips, the company’s advances in AI networking (Tomahawk 6 switches) are enabling massive AI clusters in a manner that can lower latency and improve bandwidth, all while reducing power consumption. Broadcom's $61 billion acquisition of VMware, an infrastructure software company, is also proving to be a brilliant move. Broadcom’s infrastructure software business now operates at a 93% gross margin and 76% operating margin.\n\nConsidering Broadcom’s cutting-edge AI offerings and robust financials, the stock seems an impressive pick now.\n\nServiceNow\n\nServiceNow (NOW -0.38%) generates substantial revenue by selling enterprise AI and workflow automation solutions through its Now Platform. In the second quarter, the company generated over $3.1 billion in subscription revenue, up 22.5% on a year-over-year basis. With another $102 million earned from professional services and other areas, the company generated more than $3.2 billion in revenue in the second quarter, up 22.5%. Management expects to hit a $15 billion-plus subscription revenue target in 2026.\n\nThis tech giant has emerged as a significant beneficiary of the increasing adoption of enterprise AI globally. The company's Now Assist offering (a suite of generative AI capabilities integrated into the Now workflow automation platform) is projected to generate $1 billion in annual contracted business by 2026, almost four times higher than $250 million annual contracted value in early 2025.\n\nServiceNow served 528 customers paying above $5 million in annual contracted value, while the number of customers contributing beyond $20 million annually expanded by more than 30% year over year in the second quarter. The company’s Now platform boasts a remarkable 98% renewal rate, highlighting the stickiness of its offerings.\n\nThe enterprise software leader generated $535 million in free cash flows, translating into a 16.5% free-cash-flow margin in the second quarter. The company is committed to returning capital to shareholders, as is evident from $361 million worth of share repurchases in the second quarter. Despite these buybacks, ServiceNow boasts an impressive $10.8 billion in cash and investments at the end of the second quarter.\n\nConsidering the ServiceNow's many strengths, smart investors should consider at least a small stake in the company.\n\nOracle\n\nOracle (ORCL 0.47%) generates substantial cash flows by developing and selling cloud infrastructure and database software solutions, many of which are powering complex AI workloads.\n\nOracle's database technology works in conjunction with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI, Oracle's cloud computing platform). It is also compatible with all of the leading cloud platforms, such as Amazon’s AWS, Alphabet’s Google Cloud, and Microsoft’s Azure. Additionally, Oracle Database 23ai enables enterprises to work with their proprietary data and all the popular large language models while maintaining complete security.\n\nThe company reported $15.9 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended May 31), up 11% year over year. OCI was a significant growth driver, and saw revenue jump 52% to $3 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe enterprise technology leader generated $20.8 billion in operating cash flow during fiscal 2025, an increase of 12% year over year. With its backlog growing 41% year over year to $138 billion at the end of fiscal 2025 and further expected to grow 100% by the end of fiscal 2026, Oracle enjoys exceptional revenue visibility.\n\nOracle is also committed to returning capital to shareholders, as is evident from $150 million in share buybacks in the fourth quarter and dividend payments of almost $4.7 billion in fiscal 2025. Management also expects OCI revenue to grow year over year by 70% in fiscal 2026, while total revenue is expected to be at least $67 billion, up 16%. This highlights the company’s solid growth prospects in the coming year.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:27:27.745395+00:00"}

Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is expected to attend the White House event.\n\nCorning will dedicate an entire factory in Kentucky to Apple glass production, increasing that company’s workforce in the state by 50%, the iPhone maker said. Corning was already a supplier to Apple, making glass for the very first iPhone at the same factory.\n\nAs part of what it calls the American Manufacturing Program, or AMP, Apple promised to bring more of its supply chain and advanced production to the US. The company’s AMP partners include glassmaker Corning Inc., Applied Materials Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and others, the company said.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. committed to spending another $100 billion on domestic manufacturing ahead of an event with President Donald Trump, marking the latest pledge by the tech giant to increase US production as it seeks to avoid punishing tariffs on its flagship iPhones.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump signed an order Wednesday hiking tariffs on goods from India by an additional 25% over its purchases of Russian oil, on top of a 25% country-specific duty set to take effect Thursday.\n\nWhile Apple’s promised investment is substantial, it stops short of the full shift to US-based production that Trump and top White House officials have envisioned.\n\nEarlier this year, the president threatened to hit Apple with a tariff of at least 25% if it didn’t move manufacturing of the iPhone to the US, a day after meeting with Cook at the White House. Trump administration officials have suggested that Apple could assemble its phones and other electronics domestically using robotics.\n\nApple said last week that it took an $800 million hit from tariffs in the June quarter — slightly less than previously projected — and expected them to add $1.1 billion its costs in the September quarter, assuming no policy changes or new duties.\n\nDuring a call last week with analysts, Cook said “the vast majority” of iPhones sold in the US come from India, while the bulk of other products, such as MacBooks, iPads and Apple Watches, sold in the US are manufactured in Vietnam.\n\n“We obviously try to optimize our supply chain,” Cook said at the time. “And ultimately, we will do more in the United States.”\n\nBut onshoring manufacturing, particularly for the iPhone product line, would amount to a massive undertaking for Apple, whose facilities in China and India employ several hundred thousand people and involve heavily customized processes.\n\nInstead, Cook has led a push to win a tariff carve-out for the company’s most important products. Trump is readying plans to unveil levies on all products containing semiconductor chips as soon as next week. Separately, the president’s country-specific tariffs on dozens of trading partners are set to take effect on Thursday.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Apple was able to convince Trump to exempt its products from import taxes. If Cook is able to do so again, it could help the company avoid costs that analysts expected to erode profit margins and increase consumer prices — or even offer a competitive advantage over foreign rivals including Samsung Electronics Co.\n\nCook has sought to curry favor with Trump over a series of private meetings and dinners, and was among a small group of tech leaders — including Elon Musk, Alphabet Inc.’s Sundar Pichai, Meta Platforms Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos — who attended the president’s second inauguration at the US Capitol.\n\nStill, Apple’s initial $500 billion, 20,000-job pledge, first announced in February, represented just a slight acceleration over its prior investments and previously announced plans, adding $39 billion in spending and an additional 1,000 jobs annually.\n\nThe Apple event is the latest in a flurry of announcements Trump has made alongside corporate leaders who have said they plan to increase their US presence.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump announced a $100 billion investment in artificial intelligence data centers from Oracle Corp., SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI Inc. — with a goal of increasing the total to at least $500 billion — a bid to boost American innovation in technology and artificial technology. OpenAI and Oracle later announced they will develop 4.5 gigawatts of additional US data-center capacity in an expanded partnership.\n\nThe president has also ramped up partnerships with key players in the chip industry, announcing that Nvidia Corp., the dominant player in chips for AI models, plans to produce as much as half a trillion dollars’ worth of AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years through manufacturing partnerships.\n\nTrump has also made securing investments a key part of negotiating with other countries on geopolitical issues, such as trade.\n\nPart of the US’ deal with the European Union included an agreement from the EU to purchase $750 billion in American energy products and invest $600 billion in the US, while the president’s deal with Japan includes the creation of a $550 billion fund to make investments in the US.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:27:35.433370+00:00"}

Its architecture supports deployment across major public clouds, open table formats like Apache Iceberg and the integration of structured and unstructured data, essential for building scalable AI pipelines. Tools such as Snowpark, the Native App Framework and Polaris Catalog offer a flexible developer environment, while Cortex AI allows business users to run large language models directly on governed enterprise data. Adoption of these capabilities continues to expand. Over 5,200 customer accounts used Snowflake’s AI and ML features weekly in the first quarter. At Summit 2025, SNOW introduced more than 100 new features, including Snowflake Copilot for conversational queries and native access to Meta’s Llama 4. The partnership with Microsoft further enhances Snowflake’s reach by enabling Cortex AI on Azure, while integrations with Acxiom and firms like Siemens and Dentsu bring customer intelligence and campaign analytics directly onto the platform. The developments are contributing to steady enterprise traction. Snowflake reported $996.8 million in product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, up 26% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter product revenue is pegged at $1.04 billion, with the consensus mark for total customers being pegged at 11,961 customers. The consensus mark for remaining performance obligations is pegged at $6.84 billion for the to-be-reported quarter. As enterprises continue investing in AI-ready data platforms, Snowflake’s ecosystem depth, product innovation and cross-cloud flexibility position it to benefit from the growing demand.\n\nSnowflake SNOW and Oracle ORCL are leading the shift as enterprises modernize data infrastructure to meet the demands of large-scale AI workloads. Snowflake offers a cloud-native architecture with strong scalability, cross-cloud flexibility and integrated AI tools like Cortex AI and Snowpark. Oracle combines its enterprise software legacy with a growing cloud portfolio, including Oracle Autonomous Database, MySQL HeatWave and AI-enhanced infrastructure through OCI and multicloud partnerships. Per the Datainsights Market, the global cloud data platform market is valued at $22.78 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach $104.50 billion by 2033, witnessing a CAGR of 24.3%. As enterprise investments in AI-ready infrastructure accelerate, both SNOW and ORCL are well-positioned to capture demand. However, SNOW or ORCL, which of these cloud data stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Case for ORCL\n\nOracle is building a vertically integrated enterprise platform for AI-powered workloads. ORCL’s stack combines cloud infrastructure, autonomous databases and industry-focused applications, supported by expanding multi-cloud partnerships with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and AWS. The architecture is designed to support mission-critical systems while enabling customers to run AI models securely on enterprise data.\n\n\n\nOracle continues to integrate generative AI across core products. The latest 23ai database enables vector search, retrieval-augmented generation and model fine-tuning directly on enterprise data. These capabilities have seen growing adoption across the public sector, healthcare and industrial clients. Oracle’s Fusion and NetSuite applications now embed AI assistants that help enterprises automate invoice processing, employee service requests, financial forecasting and procurement planning, allowing enterprises to streamline critical workflows across departments.\n\n\n\nOracle’s platform capabilities are translating into broad-based cloud momentum. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, total cloud revenue rose 27% year over year to $6.7 billion. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenues grew 62% year over year for the last reported quarter. Database services reached an annualized revenue of $2.6 billion, up 31%. Fusion and NetSuite Cloud ERP revenues both reached $1 billion, growing 22% and 18%, respectively. Strategic back-office SaaS applications now contribute $9.3 billion in annualized revenue.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 cloud services and license revenue is pegged at $12.21 billion, with the consensus mark for cloud license and on-premise revenue being pegged at $891 million.\n\n\n\nAs enterprises scale AI adoption and modernize their back-end systems, Oracle’s platform breadth, multicloud flexibility and embedded intelligence place it in a strong position to support enterprise transformation at scale.\n\nPrice Performance and Valuation of SNOW and ORCL\n\nIn the year-to-date period, SNOW shares have rallied 33.3%, while ORCL shares have appreciated 53.4%.\n\nSNOW and ORCL Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn terms of valuation, Snowflake appears more expensive, trading at 13.64X forward 12-month Price/Sales compared with Oracle’s 10.43X.\n\nBoth Snowflake and Oracle hold a Value Score of F.\n\nSNOW and ORCL Valuation\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow Do Earnings Estimates Compare for SNOW & ORCL?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SNOW’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $1.06 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 27.71% increase year over year.\n\nSnowflake Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nSnowflake Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nSnowflake Inc. price-consensus-chart | Snowflake Inc.

Stress on the grid is sending Americans' electricity bills higher , and the US is losing ground to foreign competitors looking to host the new generation of computing hubs that hold and process data generated by some of the most powerful companies in the world.\n\nClosing that gap, according to eight different analysts, researchers, and energy traders who spoke with Yahoo Finance, will require a long lead time, an intensive amount of new energy infrastructure development, and an enormous amount of capital.\n\nIn some of the country's most important markets, this \"misalignment of expectations\" could equal a lag of at least one to two years, if not longer, before the power that data center developers are seeking is actually available, according to a July report by clean energy fuel cell provider Bloom Energy ( BE ).\n\nBut America's tech industry may be overestimating just how much pressure the power grid can take — and how quickly the nation's utilities will actually be able to meet the rampant demand. Aging infrastructure well beyond its useful life, decades of stagnant industrial investment, and years-long delays in getting new power connected to the grid may put a wrench in Big Tech's plans.\n\n\"The large data center developers and their hyperscaler customers want power right away,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of electricity infrastructure consulting firm Grid Strategies.\n\nIn turn, US electricity demand has exploded and is projected to grow five times faster over the next 10 years than it did in the previous decade, according to research from Bank of America ( BAC ). And these companies are showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe world's largest tech companies are waging a power-driven arms race to be at the forefront of the computing and AI technology wave. These so-called hyperscalers — including tech giants like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOG ), and Oracle ( ORCL ) — have poured money into pushing artificial intelligence development and computing ability ever further.\n\nFor more than a decade, the demand for power across the US has been nearly stagnant, growing by less than 1% per year. Then came the data center revolution.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDunne's company stands to benefit.\n\nPower play\n\nAcross the globe, a web of thousands of data centers is springing up, from “Data Center Alley” in Loudoun County, Va., to Richland Parish in the northeastern corner of rural Louisiana and Kolkata, India, and it forms the backbone of the AI and cloud-computing industries.\n\nGlobal power usage by data centers is expected to grow from a current level of around 55 gigawatts to 84 gigawatts — equivalent to the power usage of roughly 70 million homes — in only the next two years, according to research from Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnd the biggest names in tech are only increasing their plans for more.\n\nIn December, Meta (META) announced plans to spend $10 billion building the largest data center hub in the Western Hemisphere, 250 miles north of New Orleans. The site, which Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg has said will be bigger than the island of Manhattan, is expected to come online in 2030.\n\nThis year, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta alone are expected to spend $364 billion in capital expenditures, much of it going toward AI technology development.\n\nBut the increasing demand from data centers that each require a power draw equivalent to thousands of homes is running up against an aging and largely stagnant North American grid, threatening stability.\n\n\"The size and speed at which large data centers, typically developed to support the computing needs for AI and cryptocurrency mining, are expanding across the country\" represents a \"significant near-term reliability challenge,\" according to research from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a nonprofit deputized by the federal government to regulate the power grid.\n\nTo understand the problem, you have to understand how the grid works. At a basic level, electricity follows a roughly three-step process to reach a home, a data center, or any other endpoint.\n\nA power source, such as the Linden Cogeneration Plant that lights up the night sky outside New York City or the soaring towers of Georgia's nuclear Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, generates energy. That energy is then transmitted across power lines that crisscross the country. Once it reaches its destination, the electricity is distributed to the tangle of smaller lines that many Americans see running through their communities and that carry it to its final destination.\n\nThe generation sources, such as coal plants and solar farms, determine capacity, or how much power is actually available for use. And the market is already capacity-constrained.\n\n\"We've grown accustomed to several decades of pretty slow demand growth in the electric sector, and the last few years have really turned that on its head,\" Brendan Pierpont, the director of electric modeling at the research organization Electric Innovation, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe gap has already begun to push tech developers to look abroad. While the US still claims the dominant share of data center power markets globally, the rest of the world is gaining ground. The Asia Pacific region has seen the lion's share of added power supply over the last decade, according to Goldman Sachs research. Beijing is now the world's second-largest market for hyperscaler power capacity, only behind the US's northern Virginia region, according to reports from Synergy Research Group.\n\nTo be sure, North America is projected to have the largest amount of new power coming online in the next five years out of any global region. But fresh development takes a long time.\n\nOn the shorter end of the spectrum, Goldman Sachs utilities analyst Carly Davenport told Yahoo Finance, a company like NextEra could likely bring a solar or wind facility into service within 18 to 24 months. But if the goal is to bring on serious capacity through a project at the scale of a gas plant, where new builds on average have added four times the capacity of a new solar build, or a much larger capacity nuclear power plant, the timeline is much longer. In the meantime, hyperscalers may have to find other answers.\n\n\"If you are deciding today that you want to build new gas, you likely will not be able to take delivery of a turbine until 2029,\" Davenport said. \"If you're wanting to build new nuclear, that's something that we think is more [of] a mid-2030s type event to actually get that online.\"\n\nAnd once a new generation resource is built, it often has to sit in a years-long queue just to get connected to the grid. At PJM Interconnection, the grid operator of the largest power market in the US, the process to get grid-connected takes five years on average, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nOnly around a fifth of the generation projects that requested grid connection between 2000 and 2018 were in commercial operation by 2023, the Laboratory found.\n\nEnough to keep the hyperscalers happy? A power plant in Linden, New Jersey. Photo by Kena Betancur/VIEWpress) · VIEW press via Getty Images\n\nThe $800 billion push\n\nWork on the infrastructure that brings power from source to destination — the transformers and power lines running throughout the country — has also remained largely stagnant.\n\nThirty-one percent of transmission equipment and 46% of distribution equipment in the US are within five years of the end of their useful life or have already passed that point, according to research from Bank of America. Across the country's electric utilities, which deliver energy to customers and maintain the infrastructure required to do so, two-thirds of 2024 spending went toward replacing existing infrastructure, the bank found.\n\nAnd the pace of new grid development has been slowing down.\n\nThe US built an average of 1,700 miles of transmission infrastructure per year through the first half of the 2010s, but the back half of the decade saw only 645 miles built on average per year, according to Grid Strategies.\n\nTo be sure, data centers are also not the only things pulling on the grid. Electrification mandates, electric vehicle development, and other power-hungry technologies like cryptocurrency mining all continue to exert pressure on a strained grid.\n\n\"I think what's happening is sort of refocusing to people, 'Hey, we have these assets that are now approaching 30 to 40 years [of operation], and not only do you need to replace them, you need to upgrade them,\" Bank of America industrials analyst Andrew Obin told Yahoo Finance. \"If you run the grid without real money for 20 years, things start to break.\"\n\nIn response, the utilities industry is not sitting still.\n\nGE Vernova (GEV), which supplies equipment to customers including AI and cloud-computing data center developers, utilities companies, and industrial-scale power projects, saw its orders for power-related equipment increase by more than 40% in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024, according to the company's latest earnings report. The company has received $500 million in orders specifically for data center electrification this year, compared to $600 million throughout all of 2024, CEO Scott Strazik said on the earnings call.\n\nBut meeting the growing need will require an immense amount of both capital and labor.\n\nUtilities are now expected to spend $800 billion over the next five years, compared to only $550 billion spent between 2020 and 2024, Goldman Sachs' Davenport told Yahoo Finance, and the US is projected to need to add more than 500,000 jobs by 2030 in the electric sector.\n\nMarket stress\n\nEach year, PJM holds a capacity auction to determine the lowest pay-rate energy producers are willing to accept from the grid operator to guarantee that they will be ready to provide power at any time during the delivery period covered by the auction, usually several years out.\n\nIn this summer's auction, generators offered an additional 2,669 megawatts of power supplies to be added through infrastructure upgrades and new builds.\n\nIt was the first time in the past four auctions that new capacity was added. But the additions only meet around half of the demand PJM is expecting to see over the coming three years. That impact will show up in Americans' electricity bills.\n\nIn PJM's 2024 auction, the utility's clearing price — the end price that determines what it has to pay all participating power generators — was $269.92 per megawatt-day, an 800% increase from the previous year.\n\nThat December, after utilities companies warned customers in PJM-covered Pennsylvania that monthly bill prices could increase by $15, Governor Josh Shapiro filed a lawsuit against PJM, claiming the grid operator's poor processing capabilities had harmed customers and created \"potentially the largest unjust wealth transfer in the history of U.S. energy markets.\"\n\nIn response, PJM filed a proposal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to create a price collar for the coming auctions that was accepted and put into effect.\n\nThis year's auction saw prices clear levels more than 20% higher, at $329.17 per MW-day, which is the price cap established by the PJM proposal. This is expected to raise consumers' electric bills in PJM's coverage area — 13 states across the mideast region of the country plus Washington, D.C. — by 1.5%-5%, on average, according to the operator.\n\nThis effect is not constrained to only the country's biggest or fastest-growing markets.\n\nIf a developer cannot find power in one market or is unwilling to accept proposed timelines, several experts told Yahoo Finance, it will go elsewhere until it finds a market that suits its needs.\n\n\"The stress on every grid from increased electricity demand doled out by data center clusters is noticeable,\" Brad Jones, managing partner of power-trading specialist hedge fund Standard Normal, told Yahoo Finance. \"We are really and truly seeing it everywhere.\"\n\nAaron Tinjum, the vice president of energy at the Data Center Coalition trade association, which counts Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Oracle as members, told Yahoo Finance that while the industry has largely tried to \"right-size infrastructure and minimize any unnecessary costs, the data center industry has also experienced the acute impacts of under-forecasting and insufficient communication\" that have created \"multi-year project delays in key data center markets.\"\n\n\"While we recognize that grid planning and management is ultimately the role of utilities, grid operators, and regulators, the data center industry has been actively leaning in as a committed and engaged partner across the country to help advance and accelerate grid modernization and energy infrastructure to support American economic competitiveness and national security,\" Tinjum said.\n\nOver the long term, US capacity is largely expected to meet demand, Davenport told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe NERC has projected that several hundred gigawatts of capacity from new generation are expected to arrive within the decade.\n\nBut in the meantime, the gap between supply and demand has pushed the biggest tech players to search for other solutions.\n\nIn March 2024, Amazon Web Services announced a deal worth $650 million with power producer and energy infrastructure operator Talen Energy (TLN). In return for that sum, Talen is set to provide Amazon with more than 1.9 gigawatts of energy from its Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, one of the largest nuclear plants in the country, to power a data center site directly adjacent to the plant.\n\nThen in September 2024, Microsoft inked a deal with Constellation Energy (CEG) to purchase power that Constellation plans to generate by bringing one of two reactors at the decommissioned Three Mile Island nuclear plant back online by 2028.\n\nElectricity Innovation's Pierpont told Yahoo Finance that he expects hyperscalers and other large tech players to increasingly pursue deals like Amazon's and Microsoft's as they look at how much power they can generate themselves on-site — especially as data center development shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nAlphabet recently announced on its Q2 earnings call that data centers and networking equipment made up a full third of its $22.4 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, while Microsoft said it will spend $80 billion by the end of the year to \"build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.\"\n\n\"Helping accelerate growth while also making sure we pay our fair share for the electricity to serve our operations is critical for Google,\" Alphabet said in a statement provided to Yahoo Finance. \"Our priority is to help responsibly scale grid systems, making them more reliable, resilient and affordable for everyone.\"\n\nAmazon implied on its Q4 2024 earnings call that it will spend around $63 billion on capex in the second half of 2025, and Oracle predicted in its Q4 earnings call that the \"vast majority\" of its projected $25 billion-plus in capex will be spent on \"equipment that is going into data centers and not for land or buildings.\"\n\n“We work closely with utilities and grid operators to plan for future growth,\" Amazon said in a statement. \"Where we require specific infrastructure to meet our needs (such as new substations), we work to make sure that we’re covering those costs and that they aren’t being passed on to other ratepayers.\"\n\nTech players have begun to announce initiatives to ease some of the burden of their grid draw. Google recently signed agreements with two US utilities to operate a \"demand response\" model for its data centers that can \"shift or reduce\" power during peak demand times, which the company said will help to get new developments grid-connected more quickly, reduce the need for new capacity, and make it easier for operators to better manage power grids.\n\nBut activist groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) say they haven't seen the tech players live up to their claims.\n\n\"As state regulators respond to growing demand, the data center industry has demonstrated a lack of transparency about their energy use and an unwillingness to aggressively push for state and federal policy that would unlock barriers to the clean energy and transmission infrastructure needed to meet their stated goals,\" SELC climate initiative leader Alys Campaigne told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSELC has threatened Elon Musk's xAI with lawsuits over its Colossus data center project in Memphis that activists say involved installing gas turbines without proper permitting. SELC has also worked with other activist groups to block data center developments.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta, and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPower hungry: Construction at an Amazon Web Services data center on Aug. 22, 2024, in Boardman, Ore. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane) · ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFor its part, the energy industry is likely to push back plans to retire existing gas and coal plants that can provide steady capacity, even if they are at or near the point of decommissioning, Goldman Sachs' Davenport and Bank of America's Obin told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"You could push those [retirement timelines] out and to the right to a degree to try to bridge the gap,\" Davenport said. \"They're not getting pushed out to the right by 10 years, but could you see two, three-year push-outs? I think that's absolutely reasonable.\"\n\nThe industrial sector is also likely to push harder on existing infrastructure that might not be operating at its full capacity limit, Obin said.\n\nAnd regulators such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are finding ways to step in, including by forcing PJM to reform its grid connection queue process to make sure new energy resources like the more than 100 GW of solar capacity currently in its pipeline can get plugged in more effectively.\n\nIn the meantime, as the grid works to grow and manage increased loads, the major tech developers will be forced to adapt, the experts who spoke with Yahoo Finance said.\n\nIf renewable energy sources such as new solar and wind developments remain stuck in connection pipelines, some companies may join xAI in looking toward non-renewable solutions like gas turbines that they can quickly bring online.\n\n\"A lack of capital is not the most pressing bottleneck for AI progress,\" Dan Dees, Goldman Sachs' co-head of global banking and markets, said in a report from the bank on AI's energy demand. \"It's the power needed to fuel it.\"\n\nJake Conley is a breaking news reporter covering US equities for Yahoo Finance.

This is a great sign ahead of AMD’s Q2 report, as the company’s Central Processing Units (CPUs) and GPUs led to a 57% surge in its data center revenue in Q1.\n\nAlso fueling investor sentiment is that recent U.S. policy shifts have loosened export restrictions, allowing AMD to resume its chip shipments to China and potentially adding hundreds of millions in revenue. Rebounding and surging over +70% in the last three months, AMD stock is now up +45% year to date to impressively top the S&P 500 and Nasdaq’s returns of +6% and +8% respectively, while even topping Nvidia’s +32%.\n\nAMD’s Q2 Expectations\n\nWith analysts expecting another strong quarter of data center growth, AMD’s Q2 sales are expected to be up 27% to $7.41 billion compared to $5.84 billion a year ago. However, AMD is also facing the impact of competitive pricing in the CPU and GPU market, with Q2 earnings thought to have dipped to $0.47 a share compared to EPS of $0.69 in the prior period.\n\nAttributing to margin pressures, higher R&D spending on its next-generation GPUs is thought to have weighed on AMD’s bottom line during Q2 as well.\n\nThat said, AMD has reached or exceeded the Zacks EPS Consensus for 25 consecutive quarters, dating back to April of 2019, and has posted an average EPS surprise of 2.3% over its last four quarterly reports. Plus, AMD is still projected to post double-digit top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2025 and FY26, but Wall Street is very much anticipating the company's Q3 guidance to see if the chipmaker can sustain its growth trajectory.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:28:08.344875+00:00"}

It bought around $330 million worth of TSMC shares and $170 million in Oracle Corp., they show.\n\nThat’s while SoftBank’s signature Vision Fund has monetized almost $2 billion of public and private assets in the first half of 2025, according to a person familiar with the fund’s activities. The Vision Fund prioritizes its returns on investment and there is no particular pressure from SoftBank to monetize its assets, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing private information. A representative of SoftBank declined to comment.\n\nAt the heart of SoftBank’s AI ambitions is chip designer Arm Holdings Plc. Son is gradually building a portfolio around the Cambridge, UK-based company with key industry players, seeking to catch up after largely missing a historic rally that’s made Nvidia into a $4 trillion behemoth and boosted its contract chipmaker TSMC near a $1 trillion value.\n\n“Nvidia is the picks and shovels for the gold rush of AI,” said Ben Narasin, founder and general partner of Tenacity Venture Capital, referring to a concerted effort by the world’s largest technology companies to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to get ahead. SoftBank’s purchase of the US company’s stock may buy more influence and access to Nvidia’s most sought-after chips, he said. “Maybe he gets to skip the line.”\n\nSoftBank, which reports quarterly earnings Thursday, should’ve benefited from that bet on Nvidia — at least on paper. Nvidia has gained around 90% in market value since hitting a year’s low around early April, while TSMC has climbed over 40%.\n\nThat’s helping to make up for missing out on much of Nvidia’s post-ChatGPT rally — one of the biggest of all time. SoftBank, which was early to start betting on betting on AI long before OpenAI’s seminal chatbot, parted with a 4.9% stake in Nvidia in early 2019 that would be worth more than $200 billion today.\n\nCrippling losses at the Vision Fund also hampered SoftBank’s ability to be an early investor in generative AI. The company’s attempts to buy back some Nvidia shares, alongside those of proxy TSMC, would help Son regain access to some of the most lucrative parts of the semiconductor supply chain.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:28:10.208316+00:00"}

Even after shareholders practically begged the billionaire to leave DOGE and focus on Tesla full-time, Musk’s return to Austin hasn’t been so glamorous. The electric-vehicle company missed Wall Street expectations and experienced a double-digit percentage revenue decline in the second quarter of 2025. Tesla’s stock price is down nearly 20% this year.\n\nBut shareholders are doing the opposite of pulling the plug on Musk; they’ve just awarded him a pay package worth some $29 billion—in what shareholders called a “critical first step toward” keeping “Elon’s energies focused on Tesla,” reports the New York Times.\n\nWhile Musk remains the No. 1 richest person on the planet, fellow members of the ultrarich like Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg are tapping at the door to replace him at the top of the billionaire list.\n\nMusk’s climb to the top of the world\n\n2024 was a standout year for Tesla.

Cantor Fitzgerald forecasts this growth for fiscal 2025 to exceed 500%. However, this segment represents less than 0.5% of Oracle Corporation’s (NYSE:ORCL) total revenue.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald expects core OCI Infrastructure-as-a-Service revenues, excluding the implied CDBS forecast, to rise from 56% growth to 85% growth in fiscal 2026. The firm also kept its adjusted OCI estimates 5-6% higher than consensus estimates for fiscal years 2028 and 2029.\n\nThe firm justified the new price target due to the strong momentum in core OCI and the potential for further positive updates to its OCI estimates, which are already above consensus estimates.\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is an American multinational computer technology company specializing in database software, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise software solutions. The company offers one of the industry’s broadest and deepest suites of AI-powered cloud applications.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

A weaker-than-expected July jobs report raised fears about slowing economic momentum. Meanwhile, President Trump’s announcement of new tariffs on EU and Canadian imports fueled worries of renewed trade tensions. Rising bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury climbing above 4.7%, pressured equity valuations and shifted investor preference toward safer assets. Disappointing earnings from major firms like Boeing and Meta added to the negative sentiments. Together, these factors led to profit-booking and a rotation out of high-growth sectors, dragging down the benchmark indices for the week.\n\nLast Friday, the three most widely followed benchmark indexes closed a losing week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.9%, 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively. Dow Jones marked its steepest weekly decline since early April, while the S&P 500 snapped a 2-week winning streak.\n\nStory Continues\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here >>>\n\nCheck Credo Tech’s historical EPS and Sales here>>>\n\nCheck Pegasystems’ historical EPS and Sales here>>>\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks Recommendation Upgrades Cochlear and Virtu Financial\n\nShares of Cochlear Limited CHEOY and Virtu Financial, Inc.

However, since the stock had already had a massive run following recent deals with big data center and utility names, investors appeared to take profits on the less-than-absolutely perfect quarter. Management also merely \"reaffirmed\" 2025 guidance, without raising numbers.\n\nBloom Energy is blooming at AI data centers\n\nIn Q2, revenue climbed 19.5% to $401.2 million, beating expectations, while adjusted losses per share narrowed from $0.27 to $0.18, missing expectations of $0.08.\n\nBloom management also said it was looking forward to doubling its production capacity, which will no doubt entail higher costs. But that capacity growth appears to be backed up by strong demand.\n\nBloom's energy server product can produce electricity from either natural gas or hydrogen via a chemical process without combustion, thereby lowering emissions. The technology appears to be on the brink of much wider adoption, given the need for reliable, cleaner electricity at AI data centers. Last week, Bloom announced a direct partnership with Oracle (ORCL 0.47%) in which Bloom will supply on-site power to Oracle data centers within 90 days.\n\nThe announcement sent the stock flying, and CEO KR Sridhar noted the partnership may pave the way for more direct deals with AI hyperscalers. On the conference call with analysts, Sridhar noted the Oracle deal is \"the first time we as a company are directly interacting with the hyperscaler as our customer...we are the primary source, and it is load following. So it will prove that we can load follow at large scale.\"\n\nEarnings seem to be a \"sell-the-news\" event\n\nBloom has exciting AI-fueled growth potential, but since the stock had already rocketed higher last week on the Oracle announcement, it appears investors were eager to take profits on the less-than-perfect quarter. However, the bounce back following today's initial plunge indicates there weren't really any red flags to speak of.\n\nValuation would be the biggest risk here, as Bloom's stock is quite expensive.

The company is benefiting from continued momentum from its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business, including from winning cloud-computing contracts from AI-focused startups. ORCL’s continued investment in cloud infrastructure, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP, positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. Its partnership with Amazon for Oracle Database@AWS and general availability of Oracle Database@Google bodes well. Oracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is driving artificial intelligence clientele. The company's share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy. The Zacks analyst expects fiscal 2026 net sales to grow 14.8% from fiscal 2025. However, higher spending on product enhancements, toward the cloud platform amid increasing competition in the cloud domain, is likely to limit margin expansion. (You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>> ) Shares of Walt Disney have outperformed the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +27.1%). The company is benefiting from strength in Domestic Parks & Experiences revenues driven by growth at domestic parks, Disney Vacation Club and Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by decline at international locations including Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. In Entertainment, DIS expects double-digit percentage segment operating income growth in fiscal 2025. We expect fiscal 2025 net sales to increase 3.7% from fiscal 2024. However, Disney+’s profitability is expected to be hurt by higher investments in content, which will also increase programming and production costs in the Entertainment segment. For fiscal Q3, Disney expects a modest increase in its Disney+ subscriber base on a sequential basis. Disney's declining ad revenues is an overhang. The company's leveraged balance sheet remains a concern. (You can read the full research report on Walt Disney here >>> ) KKR’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +28.2%). The company’s earnings beat estimates in the trailing four quarters. The second-quarter 2025 results primarily reflect impressive growth in its assets under management (AUM) balance. The company continues to enhance and diversify its offerings, supporting its long-term goal of reaching $1 trillion in AUM by 2030. The addition of the latest capabilities to capture growing opportunities from infrastructure, real estate, growth and core investing activities is expected to scale its core businesses. Its solid liquidity position enables continued capital distribution. However, its lower return on equity (ROE) compared with the industry’s average indicates less efficiency in using its shareholders’ funds. The stock is trading at a premium, limiting its near-term upside potenial.

Discover SCENE\n\nPublic Keys is a weekly roundup from Decrypt that tracks the key publicly traded crypto companies.\n\nThis week: Strategy aims to go even bigger, Metaplanet get more ambitious with Bitcoin buying plans, and Coinbase highlights shifting altcoin drivers amid an earnings miss.\n\nStrategy Double Up\n\nStrategy wants its Bitcoin treasury to be the largest corporate treasury ever.\n\nAnd yes, that means the company is looking to overtake Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway, which currently had a Scrooge McDuck-worthy $328 billion in cash and cash equivalents sitting in the bank as of Q1.\n\nWe’ll get a better idea of how much cash the Omaha Oracle is sitting on tomorrow, when his company publishes its Q2 results “on the internet.”\n\nFor Strategy to catch up, the company would need to see the value of its BTC holdings more than double. And if Bitcoin manages to hit the $225,000 target that Benchmark is forecasting for the end of 2026, paper gains could do the bulk of the work.\n\nEven if MSTR stopped buying Bitcoin—it won’t, I know—its current 628,791 BTC would be worth $141 billion if the asset sees those kinds of gains in the next year.\n\nBut we know Michael Saylor isn’t done buying Bitcoin. In fact, he said during an interview with CNBC on Friday morning that the company is looking to own up to 7% of the total Bitcoin supply.\n\n\"I don't think we'll get all of [the Bitcoin]. I don't think in the range of 3-5% or 3-7% is too much,\" he said. \"We wouldn't want to own all of it—we want everyone else to have their piece,\" he said.\n\nTo that end, the company said during its earnings call it plans to raise another $4.2 billion to buy Bitcoin this year with preferred stock offerings.\n\nMetaplanet’s Bitcoin orbit\n\nMetaplanet, a company about 5% the size of its Bitcoin treasury idol Strategy, is raising almost as much money to buy Bitcoin.\n\nThe company announced its $3.7 billion raise through a preferred stock offering on Friday. The perpetual preferred shares would pay up to 6% dividends, the company said.\n\nMetaplanet is giving itself two years to complete the raise.\n\nKeep in mind that the Japanese firm has previously said it wants to hold at least 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. To do that, it will need to multiply its current holdings by twelvefold.\n\nIf Metaplanet were able to magically pull that off now, it would easily be second only to MSTR as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder.\n\nYear-to-date, Metaplanet’s share price has climbed a staggering 207% and an even more impressive 313% in the past year. But today, news of its monster raise didn’t have investors feeling particularly bullish.\n\nMetaplanet, which trades as MTPLF on OTC and 3350 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, dropped 7.65% during Friday’s session, closing at $7.18, or 1,063 Yen.\n\nCoinbase runs out of alt gas\n\nCoinbase’s earnings miss revealed that XRP has edged out Ethereum as a transaction revenue driver.\n\nThe San Francisco-based crypto exchange reported $1.5 billion in revenue, a 25% dip from the previous quarter and 6% lower than analysts’ forecasts of $1.59 billion, according to FactSet data.\n\nBut XRP made a strong showing among traders, according to the company’s Q2 shareholder letter. XRP accounted for 13% of consumer transaction revenue, beating out Ethereum’s 12%.\n\nAlt season fervor aside, is it time to worry about Coinbase? Bernstein analysts don’t think so.\n\nThe firm’s analysts called Q2 the \"quarter that doesn’t matter\" in their latest note, which reiterated their outperform rating and $510 price target. Coinbase is currently priced at $316.\n\n“Improving crypto market structure and width with trading focus going beyond Bitcoin into Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains driven by stablecoins and asset tokenization,” the Bernstein analysts wrote in a note shared with Decrypt. “This should drive improved trading volumes in H2, already reflected in guided July transaction revenues (~44% up vs. Q2 average).”\n\nThey added that they’re optimistic about the exchange’s partnerships with leading banks, like its new deal with JP Morgan, helps to position the company as the “leading AWS of crypto financial infra.”\n\nOther Keys\n\nTokenization, tokenization: Unfortunately for Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, saying “tokenization” 11 times during his company’s earnings call won’t make controversy over private company stock tokens disappear. But HOOD did see its revenue climb 45% in Q2, so there’s that.\n\nUnfortunately for Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, saying “tokenization” 11 times during his company’s earnings call won’t make controversy over private company stock tokens disappear.

Now, however, that approach is “yielding to a, ‘I need to act now” mindset, Sankar said in an interview.\n\nAgentic AI checks and balances\n\nAs CFOs seek to navigate economic turmoil and changing business needs, they have continued to mull how AI could best benefit their organizations and members of the finance team.\n\n“Many CFOs are starting to spend a significant chunk of their time looking to…‘what is the potential of AI?’” Sankar said. “Where can I invest in agents today so that I can get the benefits of automation?”\n\nAgentic AI — tools which are crafted to take over tasks without the input of a human — have captured a widening amount of finance chiefs’ interest in recent months. Many companies, for that matter, have moved out of the “pilot,” or testing phase of such solutions, in favor of production, with about one-third of organizations stating they have moved to full-scale deployment of such tools, according to a recent KPMG survey.\n\nAs finance chiefs contemplate the integration of tools such as agentic AI, they need to be sure they are considering their long-term impact, especially as for some, the end goal of such tools is to have agentic AI performing tasks without human interaction, Sankar said.\n\n“How can I provide a certain level of checks and balances to ensure that it is doing the right thing and that the numbers coming out of a task performed by agentic AI are as reliable as the numbers performed by my accountant, who's been doing this for 10 years?” he said.\n\nFinance chiefs are looking to find the right place for agentic AI solutions as spending on such tools continues to ramp up: according to a recent study by Big Four firm Ernst & Young, 35% of leaders anticipate their organizations will spend more than $10 million on such technologies in the next year, EY found. Nearly three-quarters of senior leaders also believe entire business units will be managed by agentic AI, according to the study.\n\nThat’s not to say agentic AI tools will entirely replace humans: “I don't think CFOs are in a hurry to get rid of their people, and replace them with agents,” Sankar said, noting the more complex tasks and analysis will always have a human in the loop.\n\nBut, as the business grows, executives may not be meeting that growth with more headcount, because “these technologies have the potential to deliver a level of automation where you can do more with the existing people,” he said.\n\nAchieving the accounting, tech skill balance\n\nAI’s continued evolution is occurring at the same time as the role of the CFO continues to change, with CEOs leaning more and more heavily on their finance chiefs to drive strategy as well as keep the finance function running smoothly. The broadening of the finance chief role is “reflecting in their desire to make investments, their desire to sponsor projects, their desire to hire the right talent or train the existing talent, to become more AI savvy, to become more data savvy,” Sankar said.\n\nIt’s also contributing to a ripple effect throughout the finance department — controllers, for instance, are gaining responsibility not just for providing the numbers, but “responsibility to provide clean, consolidated, curated data to the rest of the business,” Sankar said. The financial planning and analysis team, meanwhile, is morphing into a group responsible for supporting “agile decision-making” throughout the organization.\n\nAs the finance function sees its roles and responsibilities continue to evolve, it will be critical to ensure members of the team have the right mix of both core accounting and finance as well as technical skills. Future financial professionals may not need to become data scientists or AI model experts, Sankar said, but they need to develop a “sufficient understanding of the technology” so they can properly utilize it to meet the changing needs of their role.\n\n“There'll be a balance between accounting domain knowledge and broader business knowledge and technical savvy,” Sankar said of how finance functions in the future will be structured.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:28:40.521629+00:00"}

For one, Plug stock has had a pretty rough go of it in 2025. Through the first six months of 2025, shares had dropped 30%.

According to the company's management, momentum from Q1 carried over into the second quarter -- as April ARR landed around $310 million.\n\nThe big-picture update that investors should be on the lookout for is whether or not Nebius remains on pace to hit its full-year 2025 ARR guidance in the range of $750 million and $1 billion while achieving positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in the second half of the year.\n\nWhy is this an important earnings call for investors?\n\nOne of the major pillars supporting the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution this year is ongoing investment in capital expenditures (capex) from tech's biggest developers.\n\nDuring the first quarter, cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet guided toward a collective capex spend of $260 billion in 2025 alone. Just recently, however, Alphabet notified investors that it is raising its infrastructure spend by $10 billion this year. Of note, Meta Platforms increased its 2025 capex forecast during its own first-quarter call a few months ago.\n\nThese secular trends should bode well for Nebius. The company is an integral partner to Nvidia's ecosystem, and is helping the chip king roll out its newest Blackwell GPUs all over the world.\n\nIf Nebius reports further robust growth from its infrastructure business, I think investors will see this as a positive sign that the company is benefiting handsomely from these rising capex trends.\n\nHowever, if Nebius' full-year guidance comes in at a more tempered level compared to prior estimates, it could suggest that the company is losing ground to larger competitors such as CoreWeave or Oracle -- the latter of which just inked a $30 billion cloud infrastructure services deal.\n\nIs Nebius stock a buy before Aug. 7?\n\nSince Nebius reported first-quarter earnings on May 1, shares have risen by 36%.\n\nAlthough the stock has been trading sideways as of late, I don't necessarily see this price action as a buying opportunity. All things considered, there is still a fair amount of momentum fueling Nebius' price action at the moment.\n\nInvestors with a long-run time horizon should not worry about the specific timing of their purchases. Rather, a more prudent approach is to invest in your high-conviction positions over the course of several years and at different price points. This is a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging.\n\nWith that said, having more information at your disposal can help you make better-informed, more confident decisions when it comes to investing in an emerging growth stock such as Nebius. For this reason, it might be more optimal to assess the company's second-quarter earnings report before initiating or adding to your existing position in Nebius stock.\n\nThe main priority for investors here should be to see if Nebius remains positioned for robust growth relative to its peers in the AI infrastructure landscape over the next several years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:28:51.804841+00:00"}

During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Oracle falls in, has gained 4.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nOracle is expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.73 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.6%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Oracle.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:28:58.540414+00:00"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nNvidia’s unprecedented climb past a $4 trillion market cap this summer has not only set global valuation records, but has also made its CFO, Colette Kress, a billionaire.\n\nOn July 29, Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index listed Kress with a net worth exceeding $1 billion thanks largely to her equity holdings in the chipmaker. According to Bloomberg data, Kress owns or has options for more than 5.4 million Nvidia shares, worth roughly $1 billion at current prices.\n\nWhile valuations fluctuate with Nvidia’s share price, the milestone places her in rare company. Fellow 10-figure net worth chief financial officers include former Oracle CFO and current CEO Safra Catz and Ineos CFO John Reece, who are among the few finance chiefs to have reached billionaire status.\n\nKress, who joined Nvidia in 2013 after senior finance roles at Cisco and Microsoft, has been a key figure in the company’s AI-driven expansion beyond gaming processors into powering generative AI. During her 12-year tenure, Nvidia has become the most valuable U.S. company by market capitalization and one of the most influential players in global technology markets and smart chip manufacturing.\n\nKress’s wealth reflects how equity compensation has become the central driver of CFO net worth at hyper-growth tech companies. Unlike cash bonuses or short-term incentives, her stock grants vested for more than a decade.\n\nFor Nvidia, this compensation model extends well beyond the C-suite. The company’s stock performance has created thousands of employees who are multi-millionaires, mirroring what happened with the equity awards for employees at Microsoft, Google and Apple during their early growth waves. While this makes for a motivated workforce, it can also complicate recruiting and retention once money is no longer a differentiator, a challenge companies like Meta have recently seen in their AI recruitment tactics.\n\nNvidia’s compensation model highlights a potential long-term issue for finance chiefs at high-growth technology companies: As equity values grow, how do you keep incentivizing employees who already have achieved substantial personal wealth?\n\nCFOs at publicly traded companies are currently the youngest they have been in six years and have the highest turnover rate in the same timeframe. As equity-based compensation at fast-growing technology companies now results in higher-paid leaders, retaining executives who do not see a billion-dollar future at the company may also be difficult if opportunities elsewhere, particularly in technology, grow.\n\nKress’s inclusion in Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index also underscores the central role CFOs now play in shaping company performance and the broader employee experience and corporate culture. For Nvidia, the rise of its now billionaire CFO is a direct reflection of the company’s AI-driven market dominance and a reminder of the complex human capital challenges that accompany such rapid growth.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:29:03.953568+00:00"}

For the current year, estimates have moved from $1.24 to $1.27 over that same time period.\n\nLooking at earnings estimates, we see a mixed story, with the short-term moving lower, while long-term is moving higher.\n\nDespite macroeconomic uncertainty and potential headwinds from global trade tensions, management emphasized continued strong consumer demand and confidence in long-term growth. The company remains on track to reach its $1 billion net revenue goal by 2027, supported by strategic investments in brand-building and supply chain expansion.\n\nThe company reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance, including adjusted EBITDA of over $100 million, revenue above $740 million, and capital expenditures between $50 million and $60 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $27.5 million, down from $29.1 million a year ago, with margins narrowing to 16.9% from 19.7%.\n\nIn early May, Vital Farms reported a first-quarter EPS beat of 42%. Earnings came in at $0.37, beating estimates of $0.26, while revenue came in slightly below expectations at $162 million versus $163 million expected.\n\nVITL is valued at $1.6 billion and has a Forward PE of 28. The stock has Zacks Style Scores of \"C\" in Growth and Momentum, but a \"D\" in Value.\n\nWith a focus on ethical food production, Vital Farms has become a leader in the pasture-raised category, appealing to consumers who value animal welfare, environmental stewardship, and high-quality ingredients.\n\nThe company distributes its products under the Vital Farms brand and other trade names, reaching customers through retail stores, foodservice channels, and third-party distributors across the United States.\n\nAfter a recent pullback, the company is trading down slightly for the year. However, both the technicals and fundamentals look strong. With earnings due up in just over a week, investors should consider the name before they report.\n\nVital Farms , a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a mission-driven food company known for its commitment to transparency and ethical sourcing. The company specializes in pasture-raised products such as shell eggs, butter, hard-boiled eggs, ghee, and liquid whole eggs, all produced in partnership with a network of family farms.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nChicago, IL – July 30, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Vital Farms VITL as the Bull of the Day and Centrus Energy LEU as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Amazon's AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Oracle ORCL .\n\nStory Continues\n\nOver the last month, we have seen two firms out with strong comments:\n\nOn July 8, Mizuho launched coverage of Vital Farms with an Outperform rating and a $45 price target. The firm highlighted Vital Farms as the leader in U.S. pasture-raised eggs and positioned to benefit from strong structural trends in protein consumption and premiumization.\n\nOn July 22, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed its Overweight rating for Vital Farms and raised its price target from $39 to $41. The upgrade reflected confidence in Vital Farms' long-term growth potential in the ethical food market. The analyst cited improving fundamentals and optimism about the company's ability to execute amidst volatility.\n\nThese two upgrades are promising ahead of the earnings on 8/7. Investors should also note that industry leader CalMaine Foods (CALM) reported a 12% EPS beat, which helped the stock trade all-time highs.\n\nThe Technical Take\n\nVITL is down about 7% for the year after falling from summer highs after the CALM quarter helped the stock higher. The stock has dropped over from those recent highs down to the 200-day moving average. This provides a solid entry point for those bullish into the earnings print.\n\nThe moving averages are trending sideways, so until that earnings release, the stock is likely stuck. Let's look at those levels:\n\n21-day moving average: $38\n\n50-day MA: $35.50\n\n200-day MA: $35.25\n\nIf the stock can break those recent highs, it would break a 61.8% resistance level that would give extension targets at $57.\n\nIn Summary\n\nVital Farms offers investors a compelling mix of purpose-driven operations, consistent consumer demand, and improving fundamentals. With shares currently hovering near technical support and a key earnings report just around the corner, the setup favors those looking to position ahead of potential upside.\n\nIf the company delivers another solid quarter and guidance holds, VITL could break out of its range and push toward new highs, supported by its long-term growth story and commitment to sustainable food production.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nCentrus Energy, currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a U.S.-based provider of nuclear fuel and related services. The company supports the global nuclear power industry by enriching uranium for use in commercial reactors, enabling utilities to produce steady, carbon-free electricity.\n\nThe stock has had a monster bull run since April, moving from the $50 level to $250. This was sparked by a strong Q1 earnings report and a federal funding tailwind. However, the company reports earnings next week and investors might want to get cautious ahead of the report.\n\nAbout the Company\n\nCentrus Energy operates through two primary segments: Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) and Technical Solutions. The LEU segment provides key components of nuclear fuel, while the Technical Solutions segment supports both government and private sector clients by offering a range of services.\n\nCentrus has a long history tied to the U.S. government's nuclear program and one of its flagship efforts is deploying advanced centrifuge technology to produce High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU), a next-generation fuel required for many advanced nuclear reactors currently in development.\n\nLEU is uniquely positioned as the only U.S.-owned company actively working to domestically produce HALEU at scale, something that has become increasingly important as policymakers seek to reduce reliance on Russian-supplied nuclear fuel.\n\nThe stock has run significantly higher over the last three months and now has a market cap of $4B. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \"A\" in Growth, but \"F\" in Value.\n\nQ1 Earnings Beat\n\nBack in May, the company reported a massive 1010% EPS beat. Revenue rose sharply to $73.1 million from $43.7 million a year ago, marking a 67% year-over-year increase and exceeding expectations of $65.5 million.\n\nThe company attributed the strong results to continued operational performance and growing demand for domestic nuclear fuel production, which has become a national priority.\n\nManagement emphasized $3.4 billion in federal funding now committed to rebuilding the domestic nuclear fuel cycle, Centrus sees itself as a key player in meeting both energy and national security needs. The company highlighted its reliable enrichment operations and consistent project execution, while noting its $3.8 billion contract backlog through 2040 as a strong foundation for long-term growth.\n\nThe quarter started off the bull run, but news out of Washington helped accelerate the stock higher.\n\nTrump Fuels Nuclear Energy\n\nIn late May, and then again in June, the Trump administration enacted a set of executive actions to reduce foreign dependence on nuclear energy and boost U.S. energy supply in support of AI expansion. Both actions were highly bullish for Centrus Energy.\n\nCentrus saw immediate attention from investors and the stock went from $120 to $210 in May and then $170 to $250 from June into July.\n\nEarnings Estimates Falling Ahead of Earnings\n\nWhile all the excitement is warranted, investors might want to take some profits ahead of earnings.\n\nLooking at earnings estimates from analysts, numbers are falling for the current quarter. Over the last 90-days, there has been a 16% drop, going from $0.85 to $0.71.\n\nWhile next quarter and the current year still look good, analysts have also pulled back on next year, with numbers dropping from $3.02 just 90 days ago to $2.81.\n\nTechnical Take\n\nLEU has gone parabolic so it's not a good sign to see the fundamental story weakening. The stock recently has hit $250 and dropped about 5%, so investors look like they might be taking profits before that earnings report.\n\nThe question is where it might go after the earnings release. The risk is a disappointment on EPS, with the stock testing some moving averages below.\n\nThe 21-day MA is $210, but the 50-day is down at $170 and the 200-day MA is way down at $103.\n\nSo if we get a setback, the stock could see a big drawdown. Investors should weigh their risk-reward as we move forward.\n\nIn Summary\n\nDespite Centrus Energy's impressive run and strong positioning in a strategically important sector, the recent pullback and declining earnings estimates suggest caution may be warranted.\n\nWith the stock having more than quadrupled in just a few months, expectations are high going into the upcoming earnings report, any misstep could trigger a sharp reversal.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nWill Amazon's Q2 Earnings Benefit from Healthy AWS Momentum?\n\nAmazon's second-quarter 2025 results, scheduled to be released on July 31, are likely to reflect gains from its strengthening cloud service offerings.\n\nAmazon Web Services (\"AWS\") remains the crown jewel in Amazon's portfolio, with our model estimate projecting AWS sales of $30.72 billion for second-quarter 2025, indicating robust 16.9% year-over-year growth.\n\nIn the first quarter, AWS generated $29.3 billion in revenues with an impressive 17% year-over-year increase, pushing the cloud division to a $117 billion annualized run rate. More significantly, AWS achieved an operating margin of 39.5%, marking the highest profitability level since at least 2014 and underscoring the division's pricing power and operational efficiency.\n\nThis performance continues to solidify AWS' position as the market leader, competing effectively against Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle. Combined, AWS, Azure and Google Cloud achieved a 63% share of total enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services during the first quarter of 2025, according to new data from IT market research firm Synergy. AWS ranked No. 1 in market share by winning 29% share of the market, followed by Microsoft's 22% and Google's 12%.\n\nClick here to know how Amazon's overall second-quarter performance is likely to have been.\n\nAWS Developments During Q2 Signal Accelerating AI Momentum\n\nAmazon's AWS division made several strategic announcements during the second quarter that positioned the company to capitalize on surging enterprise AI demand. The launch of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore represented a significant milestone, offering enterprises a comprehensive AI agent deployment platform with industry-leading runtime support of up to eight hours for complex workloads. Early adoption by major customers, including Itaú Unibanco, Box, and Epsilon, suggested strong market reception for these advanced AI capabilities.\n\nThe expansion of Amazon's Nova foundation model capabilities added substantial value to the company's AI portfolio. Enhanced customization features through SageMaker AI, including support for continued pre-training and reinforcement learning, strengthened Amazon's competitive position against rivals like Microsoft and Google. The introduction of Amazon Nova Act SDK for web browser automation and Nova Premier for complex coding tasks addressed specific enterprise pain points that traditionally required expensive custom solutions.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Amazon unveiled S3 Vectors in preview, marking the first cloud storage service with native vector support at scale. This innovation promised up to 90% cost reductions compared to conventional vector storage approaches while seamlessly integrating with existing Amazon AI services. Such developments reinforced AWS' reputation for solving complex technical challenges ahead of competitors.\n\nMarket Conditions & Strategic Investments Support Growth Trajectory\n\nAmazon's substantial investments in AI infrastructure are likely to have continued paying dividends during the second quarter, with the company maintaining its aggressive $24.3 billion quarterly capital expenditure pace. This 74% year-over-year increase reflected management's confidence in sustained AI demand and positioned Amazon to capture market share as enterprises accelerated digital transformation initiatives.\n\nStrategic partnerships announced during the quarter further strengthened Amazon's competitive moat. The company's $5 billion investment in HUMAIN to accelerate AI adoption globally, combined with expanded collaboration with Meta and a $100 million commitment to the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, demonstrated Amazon's commitment to ecosystem development. These investments typically translate to revenue growth with 12-18 month lag periods, suggesting positive implications for future quarters.\n\nInvestment Perspective\n\nThe confluence of strong first-quarter fundamentals, strategic second-quarter product launches, and favorable market dynamics is expected to have created compelling conditions for Amazon's upcoming earnings report. AWS' continued evolution from infrastructure provider to AI platform leader, combined with the company's diversified revenue streams and operational efficiency improvements, have positioned Amazon to deliver results that are likely to exceed conservative guidance while reinforcing its long-term growth trajectory.

Indeed, a review of the world's most valuable companies by market cap offers up compelling insight: Eight of the top 10 companies boast membership in the $1 trillion club, and they all have unmistakable ties to AI.\n\nSome of the most important players in the semiconductor and information technology (IT) spaces have taken up residence on the list. For example, Nvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the technology, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing produces roughly 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors, and Broadcom is a critical part of the AI ecosystem, with 99% of all internet traffic passing through its equipment.\n\nWith a market cap of $705 billion, it seems like it's only a matter of time before Oracle (ORCL 0.47%) secures its membership in this elite fraternity. The company's growth is accelerating, and management's long-term outlook provides compelling evidence that AI will fuel robust growth for years to come.\n\nA trusted technology partner\n\nOracle notes that roughly 98% of Global Fortune 500 companies are among its customers, using a combination of its database, cloud, and enterprise software products and services. This gives Oracle a captive audience for its expanding suite of AI and cloud solutions.\n\nThis has helped propel the company's recent growth spurt. During Oracle's fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (ended May 31), revenue grew 11% year over year to $15.9 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.70 grew 4%. Both numbers easily surpassed Wall Street's consensus estimates, which called for revenue of $15.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.64.\n\nCEO Safra Catz noted that the company had reached a \"tipping point,\" with revenue growth accelerating, \"and it's only going up from here.\" She also said she expects cloud revenue for the coming year to accelerate to 40% in fiscal 2026, up from 24%, and far outpace the growth of its larger cloud rivals.\n\nThis is driving the expansion of the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractual obligations not yet included in revenue -- which surged 41% year over year to $138 billion. The fact that RPO is growing faster than revenue provides a glimpse into the future. Perhaps even more telling is Catz's statement that \"RPO is likely to grow more than 100% in fiscal year 2026.\" At the same time, Oracle expects its revenue to top $67 billion next fiscal year, which would represent 16% growth in constant currency.\n\nThe clear path to $1 trillion\n\nOracle has a sterling reputation for helping its clients pick the appropriate cloud and AI solutions for their needs. This puts the company in the pole position to benefit from the growing adoption of generative AI. Given the sheer magnitude of the opportunity, this transition will take years, if not decades, to unfold.\n\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is expected to generate revenue of $66.8 billion in its fiscal 2026 (which began June 1), giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 11. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Oracle would need to generate revenue of approximately $95 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. Analysts are forecasting revenue growth of nearly 18% annually over the coming three years. If the company achieves these targets, Oracle could achieve a $1 trillion market cap by 2028.\n\nWall Street's forecast appears to be in lockstep with management's long-term outlook, which is guiding for revenue of at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029.\n\nEstimates regarding the market value of generative AI are all over the map, but bear watching. Big Four accounting firm PwC estimates the market could be worth as much as $15.7 trillion annually by 2030, which helps illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity.\n\nIf Oracle can carve out just a sliver of that windfall by serving up appropriate AI solutions to its customers, its impressive growth will continue, helping Oracle join the fraternity of trillionaires sooner rather than later.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:29:07.839587+00:00"}

The integration is available to PNC corporate and commercial banking clients via the Oracle B2B marketplace in the technology provider’s cloud-based ERP, PNC said in the announcement.\n\nThe platform, launched by PNC Treasury Management in 2021, is designed to ease payment, reconciliation and balance retrieval functions and automate financial management processes, PNC said. The integration joins embedded offerings from HSBC, JPMorgan and Mastercard in the ERP marketplace, which Oracle rolled out in 2022.\n\n“By embedding our services within Oracle Cloud ERP, our clients can more effectively manage their cash position and spend more time running their businesses, while spending less time establishing bank connectivity and handling manual financial tasks,” Howard Forman, EVP and head of PNC's Commercial Digital Channels, said in the release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nERP systems sit at the heart of the enterprise, circulating critical financial and operational data across an organization’s core business functions. Cloud adoption helped expand ERP capabilities and efforts to wrest value from generative AI tools have now intensified the focus on enterprise data.\n\nOracle’s growing cloud ambitions are built on integrating data systems and activating AI. The company is investing billions to expand its cloud capacity and forging key alliances throughout the enterprise technology ecosystem, including a recent pact with OpenAI to massively expand AI compute capacity.\n\nIn the last two years, Oracle inked deals that have put its database servers inside AWS, Microsoft and Google cloud facilities.\n\n“Our database is now moving very rapidly to the cloud because … the database has all these AI capabilities, but also, quite frankly, now people can get it in whatever cloud they want,” Oracle CTO Larry Ellison said last month during the company's Q4 2025 earnings call.\n\nPNC is the latest financial institution to tighten its link to Oracle’s software business. JPMorgan was on board for the launch of B2B three years ago, tying its banking, travel card and expense services into Oracle Fusion ERP. The firm added its trade and working capital finance platforms to the package last year.\n\nOracle further extended its reach into finance earlier this year through a multiyear cloud modernization pact with Lloyds Banking Group. The deal includes Oracle database deployments in Microsoft Azure data centers.\n\n“Few sectors are evolving as rapidly as the financial services industry when it comes to cloud adoption,” Richard Smith, EVP and general manager, EMEA Cloud Infrastructure at Oracle, said in the announcement.\n\nAs AI adoption moved into the agentic automation stage earlier this year, Oracle installed an AI production suite in its cloud ERP. The company brought additional agent customization tools on line in April as a separately priced Oracle Fusion offering.\n\nThe Fusion ERP suite currently has more than 10,000 customers, according to Oracle.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:29:09.525282+00:00"}

If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. It's also good to see the share price up 76% over the last quarter.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Oracle achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.0% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 35% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 55.92.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNYSE:ORCL Earnings Per Share Growth July 29th 2025\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Oracle's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Oracle the TSR over the last 5 years was 375%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.

Born in South Africa, Musk built Tesla into a leading player in the electric vehicle market, and is pushing space travel with his SpaceX venture.\n\nMusk made a small fortune as an early shareholder of PayPal, and more recently purchased Twitter, which he renamed X. Musk has courted controversy in recent years, becoming politically aligned with President Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential election before becoming the face of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as using drugs during a broadcast interview with top podcaster Joe Rogan.\n\nGet started: Match with an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals\n\n2. Larry Ellison: $296 billion\n\nLarry Ellison co-founded software company Oracle and ran it for decades before becoming its chief technology officer and executive chairman. Ellison also owns nearly all of the Hawaiian island of Lana’i.\n\n3. Jeff Bezos: $252 billion\n\nAs the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos became something of a household name in the dot-com boom of 1999-2000, but his wealth really took off after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. In the decade that followed, Amazon expanded into web services, logistics and shipping and more.\n\nBezos purchased The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million and founded Blue Origin, an aerospace company that is commercializing space travel. He’s also a noted philanthropist, founding the Bezos Earth Fund in 2020 with a donation of $10 billion and has said that he will give away most of his fortune.\n\n4. Mark Zuckerberg: $251 billion\n\nMark Zuckerberg is the founder of Meta Platforms, the company previously known as Facebook. The youngest member of this list, Zuckerberg began Facebook out of his dorm room at Harvard and quickly expanded it over the ensuing years.\n\nMeta owns social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, as well as the messaging service WhatsApp. The company is also heavily investing in artificial intelligence.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:29:21.725522+00:00"}

The e-commerce giant entered the quarter with robust momentum from its first-quarter results, which delivered $155.7 billion in net sales and demonstrated the company's ability to navigate macroeconomic headwinds while maintaining growth trajectories.\n\nAWS and AI Initiatives\n\nAmazon Web Services continued to assert its dominance in the cloud computing space, with the company's AI initiatives gaining significant traction during the second quarter. Our model estimate for AWS revenues indicates 16.9% year-over-year growth to $30.72 billion in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n\n\nThe launch of Amazon Nova models is expected to have gained momentum throughout the quarter under review, with the newly introduced Nova Sonic speech-to-speech foundation model and Nova Act SDK enabling developers to build more sophisticated voice-based AI applications and action-oriented agents. These technological advances positioned AWS to capture increased demand from enterprises, accelerating their AI adoption, supporting expectations for continued strong revenue growth in the cloud segment.\n\n\n\nThe rollout of Trainium 2 chips accelerated in the second quarter, offering customers 30-40% better price performance compared with GPU-based instances, which is expected to have strengthened AWS' competitive positioning in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market against its strong contenders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Oracle ORCL.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:29:23.561732+00:00"}

Here's how\n\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 5 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nYou don’t have to be a millionaire to gain access to this $1B private real estate fund. In fact, you can get started with as little as $10 — here’s how\n\nIn a letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he once wrote that “the best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return.”\n\n\"The worst business to own,\" Buffett continued, \"is one that must, or will, do the opposite — that is, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low rates of return.\"\n\nAt age 94, Buffett recently decided to retire from his longtime post as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. At the time of his announcement in May, he ranked fifth on the Forbes real-time billionaires index, with a net worth of $160 billion.\n\nHere are some great examples of his advice — and holdings — in action.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBuffett’s largest holding is Apple, the iPhone maker based in Cupertino, California. Despite a major selloff in 2024, when Berkshire Hathaway dumped roughly $80 billion of Apple stock, the company still makes up 22% of Berkshire’s portfolio. That’s more than any other single holding.\n\nThe iPhone’s continued popularity, alongside solid high-margin segments for its services and software makes Apple an attractive investment.\n\nMost tellingly, Apple’s return on invested capital (ROIC) is currently sitting around 47%. That’s exactly the kind of capital efficiency that Buffett described as the hallmark of a great investment. It means for every dollar Apple reinvests into the business, it earns nearly half of it back in profit annually. That’s Buffett’s investing principle in full force.\n\nRobinhood offers a simple and convenient way to invest like Buffett in a wide variety of stocks, ETFs and options. Its platform provides commission-free investing in companies like Apple — meaning you won’t pay any extra fees to invest with Robinhood. It’s an easy and cost-effective way to add some of Buffett’s favorite stock picks to your portfolio.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:29:29.018707+00:00"}

That’s it.”\n\nHuang said that the company now discloses its roadmap to partners a year in advance for better planning.\n\nTrending: Be part of the breakthrough that could replace plastic as we know it—invest in Timeplast before the July 31st deadline and help revolutionize a $1.3T industry.\n\nHuang addressed supply concerns by revealing he “wrote off $5 billion worth of Hoppers,” adding, “If anybody would like to have some extras, you got them.

It has amassed assets over $1.56 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Large Cap Blend\n\nLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.\n\nBlend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.\n\nCosts\n\nCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.72%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise.

Cloud services represent about three-quarters of the company’s revenue. Oracle has been a solidly growing, large technology company that consistently beats market returns for many years. But the company has recently turned the corner to a whole new level. It has become an Artificial Intelligence (AI) darling.\n\nA graph of stock market AI-generated content may be incorrect.\n\nThe emergence of AI has dramatically increased the need for Oracle’s services. Among the cloud services, Oracle offers a service called Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It allows customers to tap into its vast data center networks. While the other Oracle Databases rely on traditional management and legacy data centers, OCI is the one that provides AI capabilities. Current customers include AI start-ups, including OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nThe growth potential is illustrated in the last quarterly report. Total revenue from the company was about $16 billion for the quarter, an 11% increase over last year’s quarter. But OCI revenue grew 52% for the same period to $3 billion. While that’s impressive, management has said growth should eclipse 70% this year. The company recently reported $130 billion in order backlogs.\n\nSee also: TTE: A High-Yielding Energy Play We Can't Pass Up\n\nThe latest catalyst was the announcement of several new deals for Oracle’s infrastructure services.

Carillon Tower Advisers stated the following regarding Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:\n\n“Pressure on Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) shares stemmed from concerns about the possibility that reduced capital spending in the data center market could affect the entire AI supply chain. As a critical supplier of power connection products, the company’s multi-year growth prospects are affected by overall data center capital spending trends that continue to be favorable.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ETN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Now, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has confirmed the details of the contract (but not the dollar amount) in an X post on Tuesday and in a company blog post.\n\nTo recap, on June 30, Oracle disclosed in an SEC filing that it had signed a cloud deal that would generate $30 billion a year in revenue. However, the company didn’t say who it was with or for what services. The news caused Oracle’s stock to hit an all-time high, making its founder and CTO, Larry Ellison, the second richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg.\n\nSpeculation on the identity of the customer ensued as people wondered what company could possibly need a fresh $30 billion a year in data center services. For comparison, Oracle collectively sold $24.5 billion worth of cloud services in its fiscal 2025 to all customers combined, it reported in June.\n\nOpenAI has now explained that this Oracle deal is for 4.5 gigawatts of capacity as part of Stargate, the $500 billion data-center-building project OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank announced in January. (Apparently, the $30 billion deal does not involve SoftBank.)\n\nThe WSJ reports 4.5 gigawatts is the equivalent of two Hoover Dams, enough power for about four million homes.\n\nThis isn’t a straightforward win for Oracle. OpenAI and Oracle still have to build this monster data center, which will be a costly endeavor, both in cash and in energy. They are doing so at what OpenAI called the Stargate I site in Abilene, Texas.\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle spent $21.2 billion on capital expenditures in its last fiscal year, CEO Safra Catz reported in June, and it expects to spend another $25 billion this year, she said. So, nearly $50 billion, largely spent on data centers (and that doesn’t include land purchases, she said) in two years. Although, to be clear, that money also supports Oracle’s existing customers, in addition to OpenAI’s demands.\n\nOne final interesting part to note about all of this: Last month, Altman said that OpenAI recently hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year.

We're watching Oracle, Amazon, and NXP semiconductors. Let's start here with Oracle, which is seeing shares fall despite an ounce of a partnership with OpenAI to increase Stargate's data center capacity. The five four and a half gigawatt investment in the OpenAI and Japanese Softbank owned company is expected to accelerate US industrialization, create new jobs and expand the United States position in all things AI. So your thoughts on this Dan, they Oracle and OpenAI, they announced, okay, we're going to develop four and a half gigawatts of additional US data center capacity. Explain this partnership. It doesn't sound like we have firm locations yet for the data center sites. But Sam Altman's company saying, in fact, I'll have more than five gigawatts of total capacity, more than two million chips for AI work.\n\n01:14 Dan Howley\n\nWhat a story Oracle has been. You know, as one of those companies that a lot of people have written off, they were old, they were antiquated, they were CPU era first generation applications. They're moving into AI. They have the fastest\n\n01:32 Brian Sozzi\n\nLarry Ellison says watch this.\n\n01:35 Dan Howley\n\nFastest growing cloud business. They're deploying massive gigawatt data centers all over the world. Star gets a little slow, but I like Oracle a lot.\n\n01:48 Brian Sozzi\n\nDo you agree with this? I saw a note from the smart folks over at Evercore. They said this about this news and about Evercore. They say, we believe the growth potential associated with OCI remains the primary driver for the shares in the near term and we expect they said, street estimates likely to push higher coming away from the company's next earnings call in September.\n\n02:14 Dan Howley\n\nThe most important data in every enterprise either sits in an Oracle or an SAP instance, bringing AI and compute closer. It's been the absolute champion of Oracle's run and look at the returns that investors that stuck with the company are seeing now.\n\n02:35 Brian Sozzi\n\nYeah. We need Larry and Softbank on Yahoo Finance. That's what we need. Open invitation. Also, Needham, let's look at this one, lifting its price target on Amazon from 220 to 265, reaffirming its buy rating for the e-commerce platform. So this one actually, so Amazon, obviously earnings are on deck ahead of that Dan, analysts are busy raising their price targets, right? City goes to 265. They say results should beat expectations for revenue and operating income. Needham, we mentioned goes to 265, talk about strong AWS revenue growth and margin expansion, record breaking Prime days, they call in Q3 should drive upside upside to the outlook. HSBC goes to 256. They talk about fundamentally well position they say. It's already delivered a solid start to 2025. We know the stock this year hasn't done a whole lot, your thoughts.\n\n03:43 Dan Howley\n\nWell, there's some unsung heroes in the business. Their advertising business is going over 40 billion, doesn't get a lot of credit, very high margins. AWS growth has lagged, but you have to remember 120 billion dollar plus business. And their AI play is starting to catch up. They got out the gate a little slow on the Agentic and generative AI, but they're building models, they're deploying infrastructure, and they have that massive installed customer base. So there are reasons to like them. And AI and robotics, physical AI is a real tailwind for that company in the future. They can bring the costs down and make that e-commerce business more profitable.\n\n04:37 Brian Sozzi\n\nAll right, third one I want you to take on Dan, NXP reporting a beat on earnings estimates for the second quarter. Chipmaker also seeing acceleration in its automotive business from the second into the third quarter. Uh so this one I I did see the third quarter forecast that was lower than maybe some had been forecasting. We know this is name depends a lot on the auto industry. You can see we're down about four tenths of a percent there. Um the auto industry counts for a lot of this company's revenue and industry trying to navigate obviously the Trump tariffs. The CEO did say here, automotive business accelerating massively from the second into the third quarter. Sounds like what he's they're saying is once we get through this kind of this glut, his point is we we should benefit. We're well positioned. Um you say what Dan on NXP?\n\n05:36 Dan Howley\n\nEvery company that wasn't in the AI GPU trade kind of got written off over the last handful of quarters that that inventory build up, whether it was FPGAs, whether it was CPUs, Remember, those were the essential chips that crushed supply chains. And everyone was chasing them. And then AI came and then everyone forgot about them. And really the only reason the stocks moved up was the NVIDIAs, the AMDs, the arms. Those companies are due for a rotation back and automotive is actually a big AI player. All this Adas, all this autonomy is going to also need those essential lagging edge chips. Companies like NXP should see some revitalization now that that inventory sold out.\n\n07:02 Brian Sozzi\n\nAll right, we'll keep watching.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:30:24.656110+00:00"}

That will likely require Oracle raise debt, he added.\n\n\"While there are a lot of moving parts related to Oracle's capex spend, we believe the growth potential associated with OCI remains the primary driver for the shares in the near-term\" Materne wrote.

CRM and HubSpot, Inc. HUBS are two of the most recognized names in customer relationship management (CRM) software. Both are cloud-based platforms that help businesses attract, convert and retain customers. However, they serve different ends of the market. Salesforce is the dominant force among large enterprises, while HubSpot is making strong inroads with small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs).\n\nAs investors search for sustainable winners in enterprise tech, a deeper look into each company’s fundamentals, growth outlook and valuation helps determine which of these CRM stocks offers stronger long-term potential.\n\nSalesforce: CRM Giant but Slowing Growth Warrants Caution\n\nSalesforce continues to dominate the CRM market, outpacing rivals like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Over the years, Salesforce has built a strong and interconnected platform. The acquisition of Informatica, Zoomin and Own Company shows its intent to move beyond its position as a CRM software maker and become a broader enterprise software provider focused on artificial intelligence (AI), data and collaboration.\n\nAI is now central to Salesforce’s growth plan. Since rolling out Einstein GPT in 2023, the company has embedded generative AI into its platform to help businesses automate processes, improve decisions and offer better customer experiences. As AI adoption rises across industries, Salesforce is well-placed to benefit from the same.\n\nIts latest innovation, Agentforce, reflects that momentum. Paired with its Data Cloud, Agentforce has already hit $100 million in annualized revenues just two quarters after launch. More than 4,000 customers are using it for various tasks in sales, service and marketing. Data Cloud is also expanding fast, with annual recurring revenues growing more than 120% year over year. Salesforce’s broader strategy of bringing apps, data and AI agents under one umbrella gives it a strong edge.\n\nHowever, Salesforce’s biggest challenge right now is slowing sales growth. For years, the company has delivered double-digit revenue increases. However, that pace has now cooled to single digits. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues rose just 7.7% from a year ago, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew by only 5.7%.\n\nThis slowdown reflects cautious enterprise spending amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical pressures. Analysts anticipate that this trend will persist, with mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth expected for fiscal 2026 and 2027. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow at a low double-digit rate for the two fiscals.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:30:37.282476+00:00"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nSoftware license management gaps cost companies millions in auditing expenses each year, according to a joint study by open source Java platform Azul and the ITAM Forum published last week. The two organizations commissioned Dimensional Research to survey 500 IT and software management professionals.\n\nMore than one-quarter of respondents said their organization spends between $100,000 and $500,000 a year resolving software license compliance issues. Nearly three-quarters of organizations surveyed reported a Java audit by Oracle in the last three years.\n\n“The results highlight a fundamental mismatch between the complexity of modern software licensing and the resources organizations rely on to effectively manage software compliance,” Martin Thompson, founder of the ITAM Forum, a not-for-profit industry group, said in a press release. “Poor license management can result in significant financial penalties and operational disruptions.”\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs cloud-based software piles on to existing on-premises deployments, IT asset management teams face a growing mountain of vendor contracts with steep non-compliance penalties. Simply tracking usage across hybrid estates poses ITAM challenges.\n\nMost organizations — 74% — handle license discovery and internal audits either mostly or entirely in-house, according to Azul. More than one-third of respondents point to licensing discovery and compliance as top issues facing their organization. Managing subscription services and preparing for audits were two additional pain points cited in the survey.\n\n“The increasing complexity of vendor licensing and pricing has turned routine upkeep into recurring six-figure compliance exercises,” Scott Sellers, co-founder and CEO of Azul, said in a release. “Organizations shouldn’t have to burn ITAM resources, interrupt projects or absorb surprise penalties just to run their applications.”\n\nEven minor oversights can risk costly and disruptive audits.\n\nOne-quarter of respondents said their organization spent between $50,000 and $100,000 resolving software non-compliance issues, while licensing issues cost 17% of surveyed organizations up to $1 million.\n\nJava, which celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this year, remains embedded in enterprise software as a go-to coding building block for web, cloud and now AI applications. Nearly 7 in 10 of 2,000-plus developers surveyed by Dimensional Research for a January Azul report said Java runs more than half their organization’s apps. Half of respondents were building AI apps in Java.\n\nOracle acquired Java when it closed on its purchase of Sun Microsystems in 2010. The cloud vendor made Java 24 generally available with support services via enterprise subscriptions in March. The next version, Java 25, which will have long-term support packages, is set to roll out in September, according to Oracle.\n\nEnterprises can also deploy the coding platform for less cost under open-source licensing and many have chosen that path, according to Azul. Nearly 4 in 5 Java users are migrating to open-source versions, the survey found. Security, reliability, cost and compliance were the primary reasons cited for the shift.\n\nThe overall cost and complexity of enterprise software estates helped catalyze a formal alliance between the ITAM Forum and the FinOps Foundation last month. The two groups are aiming to integrate cloud spend management practices developed by FinOps teams with software cost and licensing compliance expertise native to ITAM.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:30:47.482895+00:00"}

While NuScale Power is focused on developing small modular reactors (SMRs), BWX Technologies specializes in supplying nuclear components and fuel to the U.S. government, including naval nuclear reactors, while also advancing its small modular reactor technology for defense and commercial applications.\n\n\n\nPer Fortune Business Insight report, the global SMR market was valued at $5.81 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $8.37 billion by 2032, expanding at a CAGR of 4.98% from 2025 to 2032. Both Nuscale Power and BWX Technologies are likely to gain from the massive growth opportunity, as their technologies are poised to play a key role in meeting the rising global demand for safe, reliable, and carbon-free nuclear energy.\n\n\n\nSo, SMR or BWXT — Which of these Nuclear stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out.\n\nThe Case for SMR Stock\n\nNuScale Power is benefiting from advancements in SMR technology. The company’s expanding partner base, which includes tech giants and financial institutions, positions SMR as a key player in the future of sustainable, carbon-free energy.\n\n\n\nThe company is gaining strong momentum across various sectors, especially as energy demands continue to rise. The increasing energy demand, driven by sectors like data centers, which require continuous, reliable, and carbon-free energy, has been a major growth driver.\n\n\n\nData centers are expected to triple their energy use over the next three years, accounting for 12% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2028. This growth trend presents a significant opportunity for NuScale Power, as its small modular reactor technology offers consistent, carbon-free energy that can meet the increasing demands of hyperscale data centers.\n\n\n\nNuScale Power continues to attract strong interest from major technology companies and infrastructure capital. Companies like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet and Oracle have made substantial commitments to using nuclear energy, including SMR technology, to meet their sustainability goals, which positively impacts NuScale Power’s market positioning.\n\nThe Case for BWX Technologies\n\nBWX Technologies is benefiting from an expanding footprint in the Small Modular Reactor market, positioning itself as a key player in the development and deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.\n\n\n\nBWX Technologies secured historic manufacturing contracts in 2025 for two major nuclear energy projects, which include providing support for the life extension of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, and the deployment of a new small modular reactor at the Darlington site. This is expected to strengthen BWX Technologies' position in the global nuclear energy market.\n\n\n\nIn July 2025, BWXT secured U.S. Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program contracts worth approximately $2.6 billion to manufacture naval nuclear reactor components for Virginia and Columbia-class submarines and Ford-class aircraft carriers, with deliveries planned over the next six to eight years.\n\n\n\nThe company is also preparing for future growth in the SMR market by expecting multiple follow-on orders in Canada, the United States, and Europe. This reflects the increasing global demand for SMRs as a clean energy solution to meet decarbonization goals and growing electricity needs.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:30:49.349454+00:00"}

Semiconductor firms led by Nvidia (NVDA) are again among the best performing AI stocks. But investors are also focused on new plays such as CoreWeave (CRWV), Oracle (ORCL) and Snowflake (SNOW).\n\nTo be sure, top AI stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia face high expectations. For many companies — such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) — the rise of generative AI poses both risk and opportunity.\n\nThe Trump administration's \"AI Action Plan\" could provide upside for AI stocks. It includes over 90 federal policy actions.\n\nAI Stocks: State Regulation Stymied?\n\nImportantly, the AI Action Plan would crack down on state laws deemed too restrictive for AI development. Big tech companies lobbied to prevent states from creating their own AI laws. The Trump administration could withhold federal tech funding from states with \"burdensome\" AI laws.\n\nMeanwhile, it's unclear what the plan means for antitrust lawsuits versus tech giants filed by the Federal Trade Commission. A related question is whether the Trump administration will allow tech giants to step up the acquisitions of leading AI startups.\n\nStill to come is the Trump administration's decision on what restrictions will be placed on compute power allowed to be shipped to China. New rules would impact vendors like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nMany companies suddenly tout AI product roadmaps. In general, look for AI stocks that use artificial intelligence to improve products or gain a strategic edge.\n\nSpending on cloud computing infrastructure continues to drive AI stocks. Nvidia, Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and CoreWeave remain on the IBD Leaderboard.\n\nCloud Growth Key In Tech Earnings\n\nSecond quarter earnings for data analytics software maker Palantir are due Aug. 4. Palantir stock has gained 109% in 2025 after soaring 340% last year. Also, CoreWeave reports earnings on Aug. 12.\n\nCloud computing growth at Amazon, Microsoft and Google could move AI stocks.\n\nGoogle reported second quarter earnings on July 23. Cloud computing growth was a bright spot. Google also hiked planned capital spending in 2025.\n\nAmid worries over AI competition, Google stock is up 2% in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft fiscal Q4 results are due July 30. Amazon reports Q2 earnings on July 31. Amazon stock has gained 5% this year. Microsoft stock has advanced about 22%.\n\nAI Stocks: Semiconductor Plays Rebound\n\nA bellwether for AI stocks, chip maker Nvidia has advanced 29% in 2025, rebounding from a big sell-off tied to China-based DeepSeek's AI models.\n\nNvidia's AI chip sales to China slowed in 2025. Reversing course, the Trump administration will now allow Nvidia did to sell its lower-performing H20 AI accelerators to China.\n\nNvidia aims to broaden its customer base beyond big tech through \"sovereign AI,\" partnerships with governments. And, it's encroaching on the turf of some customers with its own push into cloud computing services.\n\nFurther, Advanced Micro Devices has climbed 38% this year. AMD hosted its Advancing AI event in mid-June. At the event, AMD updated its AI strategy. OpenAI, Oracle, Meta and xAI are among AMD's customers with new speculation involving Amazon Web Services.\n\nCoreWeave Acquires Core Scientific\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) stock has advanced 25% in 2025. Broadcom currently is supplying custom AI chips for Google, Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance. It has four other prospective customers, with Apple, OpenAI and xAI among them, according to analysts.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM), ARM Holdings (ARM), and Marvell Technologies (MRVL) are other AI chip makers to watch.\n\nShares in Nvidia-backed CoreWeave, which in March launched an initial public offering, have surged 187% in 2025. But CoreWeave stock fell after the acquisition of Core Scientific (CORZ).\n\nThe company forecast higher-than-expected capital spending as it ramps up capacity for more customers. CoreWeave is a new AI cloud services provider that rents out Nvidia GPU-equipped servers. Here's a look at how Nvidia, with a 7% stake in CoreWeave, is key to its future.\n\nAmong AI infrastructure stocks to watch, Oracle popped on its fiscal fourth quarter financial results and guidance. Oracle stock has surged 47% in 2025 amid strong growth in its AI cloud business.\n\nAmong data center infrastructure plays, Arista Networks (ANET) has edged up 1% this year. Q2 earnings for Arista are due Aug. 5. Here's an interview with Arista Chief Executive Jayshree Ullal on its AI strategy.\n\nEnterprise Data Key To AI Models\n\nHaving struggled to generate new revenue from \"copilots,\" software companies are now turning to autonomous, goal-driven AI agents. One big issue for software companies is how fast customers ramp up pilot programs to commercial deployment.\n\nPalantir — as well as Snowflake and privately held Databricks — are focused on helping companies clean up and organize proprietary data to build their own AI models. Here's a look at Databrick's strategy. Snowflake stock has advanced 40% this year.\n\nBoth Snowflake and Databricks continue to make acquisitions as they try to get an upper hand. Databricks has not discussed plans for an initial public offering.\n\nOn the other hand, not all software firms are among the top-performing AI stocks.\n\nAI Stocks: Software Plays Mixed\n\nAt TD Cowen, analysts Derrick Wood in a report said that AI software \"infrastructure\" plays have been out-performing AI application software names.\n\n\"We are hearing of a return to AI-related concerns within the apps space,\" he said. \"Conversely, sentiment seems to be gradually improving in the infrastructure software space.\"\n\nSalesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), Adobe (ADBE), and HubSpot (HUBS) are all down in 2025. Datadog (DDOG) has rebounded, he added.\n\nIn an IBD interview, ServiceNow (NOW) Chief executive Bill McDermott explained about how the enterprise software maker aims to be an AI winner. ServiceNow recently set new AI revenue targets for fiscal 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, software maker Salesforce has agreed to buy Informatica (INFA) for $8 billion to boost its AI strategy. Salesforce stock has declined 19% this year.\n\nMeta's Big Bet On Scale AI\n\nMeanwhile, Meta stock has gained 21% in 2025.\n\nMeta continues to overhaul its AI strategy. Meta has invested $14.9 billion in Scale AI for a 49% stake in the startup. Scale AI provides data labeling services that help train and produce AI large language models.\n\nScale AI Chief Executive Alexandr Wang has joined a new AI research lab at Meta dedicated to pursuing \"superintelligence.\" And, Meta has hired away top scientists from OpenAI.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has laid out five pillars of expected AI growth. They include improved advertising, engaging social media experiences, business messaging, the Meta AI app, and AI devices, including spatial computing.\n\nThe social networking giant in April launched the Meta AI app, built with its Llama 4 training model, with chatbot and web-searching features. Previously, Llama had been embedded in Meta applications such as Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nWill Apple Buy Perplexity?\n\nMeta in April released its open source Llama 4 AI model family. But Meta has delayed the roll out of its powerful Llama model, Llama 4 Behemoth.\n\nApple stock has lagged in 2025, falling 14%. Further, Apple hosted its flagship Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9. There were no major surprises on its AI efforts. The company has been losing top AI scientists to OpenAI and others.\n\nBut there's speculation Apple could purchase Perplexity to catch up in generative AI. The deal would need regulatory approval.\n\nWith iPhone 17 models expected to debut in September 2025, Apple Intelligence features will likely not be much improved, analysts say. Voice assistant Siri has yet to be upgraded with advanced AI technology.\n\nOpenAI A Threat To Apple, Software Makers?\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI was valued at $300 billion as part of a new $40 billion fundraising round led by SoftBank. OpenAI builds large, multimodal foundation models. OpenAI and Microsoft continue to negotiate over their complex partnership.\n\nWhile OpenAI's ChatGPT has pressured Google stock, the AI model maker also could compete with Apple and enterprise software makers, said JPMorgan analyst Brenda Duverce in a report.\n\n\"Recent agent releases, investments, and hiring raise our belief that OpenAI can take share from formidable hardware, software, and ad players and carve out new market space,\" Duverce said. \"If the history of disruption teaches us anything, it is that the nature of future disruption and disruptors, emerging technology convergence, and business model shifts are hard to predict. So as the pursuit of artificial general and superintelligence unfolds, we suspect that entirely new market spaces, architectural innovations, and monetization models will come to fruition — and that OpenAI could be a driving force behind many of these.\"\n\nInvestors should keep a close watch on the fierce competition in AI models. Generally, the AI models are battling in reasoning and multimodal capabilities as well as computing needs. Large language models provide the building blocks to develop applications.\n\nAnthropic's latest funding round values it at $61.5 billion. Amazon is a big investor in Anthropic.\n\nThe commoditization of AI models could spur application development. While \"training\" AI models has been the biggest driver of capital spending, the market will shift to \"inferencing,\" or running AI applications, in the long run.\n\nAI Stocks To Watch By Industry Group\n\nCompany Symbol Comp Rating Industry name AI angle Nvidia (NVDA) 98 Elec-Semiconductor Fabless Cloud computing giants buying more chips to train AI models or run AI workloads. Big lead over rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). CrowdStrike (CRWD) 95 Computer Software-Security AI chatbots expected to automate more functions in security-operations centers and reduce the time to detect computer hacking.

Credit: XanderSt/Shutterstock.com.\n\nPrivate equity company Blackstone has reportedly exited a consortium that was preparing to invest in the US operations of video-sharing platform TikTok.\n\nThis development was reported by Reuters, citing information from an undisclosed source having knowledge about the matter.\n\nThe consortium, led by Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic, aimed to acquire an 80% stake in TikTok’s US business. This would leave TikTok’s current owner ByteDance with a minority shareholding.\n\nSusquehanna and General Atlantic also have equity stakes in ByteDance, which is a Chinese internet technology company.\n\nThis consortium also includes investors like KKR and Andreessen Horowitz, with Oracle anticipated to participate. However, following Blackstone’s exit, it is uncertain whether other consortium members remain engaged.\n\nThe potential deal is at the heart of US-China trade talks and has faced many delays and uncertainties.\n\nGlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate? Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. By GlobalData Learn more about Strategic Intelligence\n\nThe deadline set by the US government for ByteDance to sell TikTok’s operations in the country has been postponed multiple times, contributing to investor uncertainty. In April 2024, Congress enacted legislation mandating that TikTok be sold or shut down by 19 January 2025.\n\nIn June 2025, President Donald Trump issued a third executive order extending the deadline to 17 September 2025.\n\nIn the meantime, TikTok is working on a standalone app tailored for US users with a distinct algorithm and data system separate from its global version, reported Reuters. This step is said to lay the foundation for the potential sale favoured by the Trump administration.\n\nThe project, internally known as “M2,” is scheduled for completion by September 2025, and represents a significant technical shift between TikTok’s US operations and its international business.\n\nIn recent months, TikTok employees have reportedly focused on replicating and relocating sections of the codebase, including AI models and user data, to develop this new app variant for US users. This change is expected to affect content access for approximately 170 million users in the US and impact revenue channels for non-US creators.\n\nByteDance is assessing various approaches to resolve national security concerns related to Chinese influence over TikTok, which may include selling or restructuring its US operations. Despite these efforts, some lawmakers have criticised the repeated extensions of the deadline as disregarding legal obligations and neglecting security risks.\n\nNegotiations earlier stalled after China signalled disapproval following Trump’s tariff imposition on Chinese goods. If an agreement is reached, the resulting entity would likely be a US-based joint venture between American investors and ByteDance.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:31:01.712957+00:00"}

And that's, you know, you and I've been following these tech stocks for a long time, right? And there's some like Oracle, which we've been speaking about recently and watching that have sort of found new life because of this AI wave. How much further can it take them?\n\n00:37 Paul\n\nYeah, there are a couple of blasts from the past, I would say Oracle and AI, but I don't think Oracle and AI with its any kind of tilt towards a large language model or even its apps is the big deal. It's OCI, right? Their cloud computing infrastructure. That's very much like Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS. If it was just an AI hopeful software company, I wouldn't have the same view of Oracle. The other thing I think will be interesting is not today, not tomorrow, but sooner or later, quantum computing will explode, and then you'll see another blast from the past because here comes IBM. IBM after all these years of being poo-pooed could be a leader in quantum computing.\n\n01:58 Speaker A\n\nWell, and IBM has already trading near a record, so it's already been seeing a lift from some of the transformations that company has been undergoing. Are there other sort of like old workhorses that you think people should be holding in their portfolios because they're part of this new wave?\n\n02:25 Paul\n\nYeah, another one that people had given up for dead was Cisco, right? For a long time, Cisco's growth had slowed, and the only reason that you would buy Cisco was it had a really high dividend yield for a tech stock. So you could get kind of a two-fer and have a call option on some price appreciation. However, Cisco, in this AI infrastructure world, has some mojo. And I also think Cisco might be part of the consortium that is permitted in the United States to buy Tik Tok, so that could be interesting. So, yeah, another one.\n\n03:33 Speaker A\n\nLet's get to the biggie here, and that is, of course, Nvidia. We had the recent news that they were going to be selling more, or that they were expecting to get the licenses again to sell H20s into China. What do you think is the biggest obstacle or risk for Nvidia at this point?\n\n04:04 Paul\n\nWell, we know, whether it's the Chinese or the dude that we have in the White House, that, you know, a policy could easily be changed from morning to afternoon. So I still worry about that. But in the meantime, I think things are going great there. And this quarter, Nvidia was supposed to do revenues of about $45 billion. And that was excluding $8 billion in H20 revenue. So now that we're back on, it won't go from zero back to eight. But think about it. This could add, and it should add to all the Wall Street models, 20% upside to revenues over the next year or so. So if this deal sticks, I'm always worried about these deals sticking.

With Wall Street watching closely, the question now is whether Oracle can turn its growth story into lasting earnings power.\n\n\"Oracle has been growing [revenue] by mid-single digits, and now it could be growing 15% to 20% [annually] for the next few years,\" Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance. \"That's why the stock has done so well.\"\n\nThe company recently inked a wave of cloud infrastructure deals, including one contract involving the rental of high-powered graphics chips (GPUs), which are essential for training and running AI models. One such agreement could add as much as $30 billion to Oracle's revenue by 2028.\n\nIts Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) division has positioned itself as a lower-cost, high-performance alternative to Amazon (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) Azure, and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Cloud.\n\nThe hyperscaler is also part of the Stargate project, a $500 billion initiative launched earlier this year alongside SoftBank Group (SFTBY), OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), and Metagenomi (MGX) to advance US AI development. Elsewhere, Oracle has committed $3 billion to expand AI infrastructure in Europe.\n\nOracle has garnered analyst upgrades, including from Scotiabank (BNS), which recently initiated coverage with a $300 price target, citing its strong position in AI infrastructure. Its analysts described the 48-year-old company as \"transitioning into a new paradigm.\"\n\nBut not all firms see Oracle spreading its wings — D.A. Davidson maintains a Neutral rating and a $220 target, and Mizuho forecast a pullback to around $180.\n\n\"The current price already reflects the upside, unless a significant acceleration in earnings growth can be achieved,\" Luria said. \"The stock is starting to look pretty expensive.\"\n\nThe fast-growing cloud business is capital-intensive and operates on thinner margins. On the other hand, Oracle's traditional software, hardware, and maintenance contracts business is in decline. But the segment makes up 60% of the company's business and has around a 50% margin, per Luria.\n\n\"The key is not just revenue growth, it's whether Oracle can convert that into profitable earnings,\" Luria said. \"That's what will determine if the stock can keep climbing.\"\n\nIn its latest quarter, Oracle reported $15.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year over year, and earnings per share of $1.70, up from $1.67 a year earlier.

The company offered predictive analytics during the game, forecasting how specific holes were likely to be played based on past information. Data-backed recaps throughout the tournament of how each hole had played were available on the APP and the website. These are likely to have generated incremental revenues for the Consulting segment.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Consulting segment is pegged at $5.21 billion, while our model projects revenues of $5.17 billion.\n\n\n\nDuring the to-be-reported quarter, IBM extended its multi-year partnership with Microsoft Corporation MSFT by establishing a new Microsoft Practice within IBM Consulting. Leveraging the strengths of both companies, the collaboration aims to develop innovative offerings and industry-specific solutions across various verticals such as retail, consumer packaged goods, government, financial services and supply chain. Complementing IBM Copilot Runway and IBM Consulting Azure OpenAI Services, it intends to deliver customized solutions to help businesses unlock new growth opportunities, navigate complex AI, facilitate seamless cloud transition and accelerate digital transformation\n\n\n\nIBM acquired Hakkoda Inc., a prominent data consultancy provider, for an undisclosed amount in the quarter. The acquisition is expected to strengthen IBM’s data expertise and augment its capability to support clients’ AI transformation initiatives. These are likely to have translated into incremental revenues in the Software segment.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Software segment is pegged at $7.48 billion, while our model projects revenues of $7.52 billion.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite solid hybrid cloud and AI traction, IBM faces stiff competition from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure.

But with nine billion of spend in the last quarter, with capex expected to be up 4x this year from two years ago, it’s very clear they’re spending and that their backlog should convert into accelerating revenue growth here in the coming quarters, well on their way to getting to 20% revenue growth next fiscal year.”\n\nAsked about the specific areas of potential growth for Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), here is what the analyst said:\n\n“It’s definitely the cloud, and that’s a combination of, as you just mentioned, cloud infrastructure, which is existing customers moving their Oracle databases to the cloud, be it Oracle’s cloud or Oracle running inside of hyperscaler clouds, and then increasingly AI.

The company is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Generative AI solutions.\n\n\n\nAlphabet expects capital expenditures in 2025 to be relatively higher than in 2024, aimed at building technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. In first-quarter 2025, GOOGL saw continued double-digit revenue growth in Search.\n\n\n\nAlphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. However, increasing litigation issues are a concern.

The company reported solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein earnings and revenues beat estimates. Revenues were driven by continued momentum from its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business, including from winning cloud-computing contracts from AI-focused startups.\n\n\n\nORCL’s continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. Its partnership with Amazon for Oracle Database@AWS and general availability of Oracle Database@Google bodes well. Oracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is driving artificial intelligence clientele. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.\n\n\n\nHowever, higher spending on product enhancements, toward the cloud platform amid increasing competition in the cloud domain is likely to limit margin expansion.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Shell have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the year-to-date period (+14.8% vs. +4.6%).

Shell remains a global leader in liquefied natural gas, with its position bolstered by the acquisition of BG Group, to generate consistent earnings by capitalizing on steady demand for this transitional fuel.\n\n\n\nStrategic moves like the Equinor JV and Pavilion Energy acquisition also support long-term growth. However, a few red flags keep the outlook in check. Q1 revenue missed expectations by nearly $10 billion and was down 6.6% year over year due to weak chemicals margin. The reserve replacement rate of just 68% continues to lag.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, delayed earnings impact from new projects, rising interest rate and ongoing pressure from the energy transition will impact the company’s near-term profitability.

Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We're checking in on shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, Oracle and Elevance Health. First up, you got TSMC getting a boost today after topping earnings estimates and raising its outlook for 2025 revenue growth. The company out forecasting sales growth of about 30%. That is up from mid 20% previously. Caleb, what do you make of it?\n\n00:24 Caleb\n\nYeah, I mean, chips are back and they're hot. And Nvidia's at record highs and the $4 trillion dollar market cap mark. Uh that's got a lot of people interested in this space again. But there's also deals being cut right now with China and US chip makers. Nvidia being uh case in point there. So, as that stock goes, a lot of stocks go with it. But Taiwan Semiconductor is a giant. It's the biggest chip maker on the planet and the demand for chips is insatiable. As long as relations are okay, and it looks like we're getting to some sort of a better ground in terms of those tariff negotiations with China, you'll see chip stocks continue to outperform. And they've been through a lot over the last couple of years. They were the hot sector, but I think they're back in style right now because it looks like tensions are cooling.\n\n01:17 Speaker A\n\nYeah, so over at TD Cowen, they have a hold on this one telling clients, uh AI cloud fueling, they say 2025's 30% revenue expansion. They talk about how AI could drive greater silicon usage and PC and mobile devices. They did call out on this one tariff impact to demand remains a risk later this year. Helps explain why they're on the sidelines. All right, moving on, Oracle, look at that one, shares higher after receiving a sector outperform rating and a street high $300 price target over at Scotia Bank, which sees strong growth potential for the software companies cloud computing business. Uh so street high $300, Caleb. They say here, we see Oracle transitioning into a new paradigm, reinventing itself, they say, as a Tier 1 independent AI infrastructure provider. Yes, I mean look at the chart. We can see the stock has enjoyed a big run, but we believe, they told their clients, Oracle remains underowned, underowned by long onlys, see opportunity for shares to rise further as Oracle outperforms expectations. So, bullish on Mr. Larry Ellison.\n\n02:42 Caleb\n\nYeah, and Oracle is one of those super scalers they call them out there that spending a lot of money to build out its AI infrastructure, build out its cloud computing uh capabilities and offer those services and support to other companies. And it is a slight pivot for a company that was really not about that 5, 10 years ago. You never would have said those words in the same sentence. But this company's been out in front of a lot of things, and I think it's benefiting from that. Any company that's doing some heavy spending on building the infrastructure because for these big mega cap companies, it's a zero sum game, the AI game. They want to own as much of it as possible. So as long as they keep spending and developing it and offering and selling those services out to other big companies, they're going to be fine.\n\n03:40 Speaker A\n\nYeah, Larry Ellison's software cats winning over a lot of new fans on the street. Lastly, you have shares of Elevance Health sinking after it cut its profit guidance for the year amid higher medical costs in the Affordable Care Act plans. The company also posted a miss uh for earnings per share. So, cut the profit guidance, Caleb. Uh reports noting higher medical costs and Affordable Care Act plans, lagging reimbursement from Medicaid. I mean the health insurers broadly not been delivering us great news. Look at the stock on that one down hard.\n\n04:25 Caleb\n\nYeah, no. And and when you cut your outlook or don't provide an outlook, you're going to expect your stock to get crushed like it's been uh crushed today down 12 or so percent. But what's important to watch with providers like this is the benefit expense ratio. How high is that expense ratio climbing in terms of the payouts they have to make? It was at 88.9%. That's up 2.6% year over year. It doesn't sound like a lot, but when that's your biggest expense and that's weighing on you, that's going to weigh on your stock, and investors see right through that.\n\n05:02 Speaker A\n\nYeah, see analysts at Vital Knowledge citing Bloomberg is saying managed care, they say probably um become the the most hated sector in the whole market right now, they say, given rising medical costs, the intense pressure and various government programs. They go on to say not much reason for people to buy the dip.\n\n05:29 Caleb\n\nYeah, and they are going to be under pressure because we know through the great big beautiful tax bill or whatever it's called that we know some of those social services are going to be cut. That means higher expenses for a lot of these providers as well. So they're going to be probably front and center of that with a lot of other companies that are facing trouble. United Health, one of the biggest healthcare providers in the country, they have other issues, other headline issues, they're going to face these problems as well.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:31:24.100802+00:00"}

While gross margins may dip, Scotiabank projects non-GAAP operating margins of 42.4% in 2026, ahead of consensus.\n\n“Our proprietary forensic analysis computes Oracle non-GAAP operating margin in F2026E of 42.4%, above consensus estimates,” the analysts said.\n\nThey also see upside in Oracle’s cloud database partnerships with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), projecting database cloud revenues to rise to $4.5 billion by fiscal 2027.\n\n“This nearly 50-year-old software giant is having an AI renaissance, and we think ORCL’s valuation premium to large-cap software peers is justified, given its 2x faster projected revenue growth,” concluded Scotiabank.\n\nRelated articles\n\nOracle ’transitioning into a new paradigm’ says Scotiabank\n\nRisks Rising?

The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Oracle belongs, has gained 5.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nOracle is expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.72 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.4%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.66 indicates a change of +14% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

That's according to Bloomberg's billionaires index. The jump is thanks to the recent rally in Oracle shares. The stock is up over 40% year to date as investors pile into names they believe will be winners in the AI arms race. Joining me now on this Yahoo! Finance tech editor Dan Howley and market domination anchor Josh Lipton, who has followed the tech industry closely. Guys, thanks for being here. Um, on the one hand, Larry Ellison probably doesn't like to be second in anything, Josh. On the other, maybe feels good for him to edge out Mark Zuckerberg, from what we know about the sort of egos of some of these tech billionaires.\n\n00:55 Josh Lipton\n\nYeah, what's incredible is you look at the move in this stock, Julie, and I was talking to Dan about this off camera, remarkable move in the stock. And analysts are still pretty bullish on this one. And you'll hear bulls talk about, yes, they'll acknowledge at this point a premium valuation, but some of them will stick with it because they do believe, in their words, you've hit this sort of pivotal moment in the evolution of Oracle as a hyperscaler, as a big cloud giant. And I was actually talking to Patrick Moorhead about this, you know, both you know Patrick. And I was just curious to ask Patrick, when you think about this landscape, what are Larry and Safra's advantages? And Patrick says, you know, I would put it at three. He said, I would say, you can have an Oracle cloud in the public cloud, but also as a private cloud, meaning a cloud computing environment that's just for you. You get, he said, a full complete stack of software. Um, and he says, let's not overthink this, it just comes down to customer choice. Like customers would prefer to have more than three. And then I asked Patrick, okay, so if you're an investor though, and you're in this for the long haul, it's three, five years out, what would be the risks you should think about? And Patrick said, you know, as always, if you're in for five years, you're already wondering what the next leg of growth is. But then he said, and Dan's point of view on this, he also said, Larry and Safra don't have their own chips. And how that shakes out over time as a potential cost disadvantage as Larry and Safra go head-to-head with the Amazon and the Microsoft and the Google.\n\n03:45 Speaker A\n\nRight. I mean, was there talk about that at some point, Oracle?\n\n03:53 Dan Howley\n\nI mean, as far as, yeah, I mean, look, this is, I think developing chips is something that only a select number of companies can do, right?\n\n04:10 Josh Lipton\n\nIt takes a lot of money and a lot of smart engineers.\n\n04:13 Dan Howley\n\nYeah, I mean, it's the Microsofts which, you know, they're still, you know, working on theirs. Uh, Amazon, they have, they've been using theirs for a while. Google's been using it for quite some time, their TPUs. Um, and you know, I think that when it comes to where you see Oracle versus these other hyperscalers is, you know, quickly, let's just go over their yearly revenue, right? So, uh, for their year 2025, they reported $57.3 billion. That's for the whole year. Let's look at Microsoft for their last year. $245.1 billion. So it's Oracle's large, but it's not hyperscale large yet, right? Like, and so I think the idea here is that people are saying, well, people are already bought into Microsoft, people are already bought into Amazon, people are already bought into Google. Oracle's right there and they're more or less doing the same thing. How do we get in there as another play for the AI space?\n\n05:47 Speaker A\n\nDoes Stargate push them into hyperscale large is the question.\n\n05:54 Dan Howley\n\nThat's the thing, right. It depends on, it depends on A, if Stargate is ever completed, it comes to fruition, right? I mean, yes, they're building out the data center. I think when they, when they announced that they showed kind of like the footings of the building itself, right? Uh, we'll have to see though if that actually turns into that huge network of data centers.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:31:52.015549+00:00"}

These factors might bolster revenue and earnings forecasts, particularly given the expansion in AI and data center demand. However, AMD's removal from the Russell Top 50 Index and its share price's premium relative to the consensus price target suggest that the market may have high expectations, which could influence future valuation assessments. With the current share price at US$155.61, compared to a consensus price target of US$138.69, the stock is trading approximately 11% above the expected fair value.

However, in the last year, AMD underperformed the US Semiconductor industry, which returned 20.5%, and it also fell short of the broader US market return of 10%.

Back in December 2020, it more than quadrupled from its initial public offering (IPO) price of $42 to a record high of $177.47 in just two weeks. At the time, investors were impressed by its rapid growth rates, catchy ticker symbol, and the fact that it was led by Tom Siebel, who sold his previous company -- Siebel Systems -- to Oracle for $5.8 billion in 2006. The buying frenzy in meme and growth stocks amplified those monstrous gains.\n\nBut today, C3.ai's stock trades at about $26. It fizzled out as its growth cooled off, it racked up steep losses, and rising interest rates popped its bubbly valuations. It hasn't traded above its IPO price since last December, and it's declined roughly 12% over the past 12 months. Let's see where it might be headed over the next year.\n\nHow does C3.ai make money?\n\nC3.ai's AI modules can be plugged into an organization's existing software infrastructure to ingest and analyze a wide range of data. Those modules can also be run as stand-alone services. Its modules are often used to detect safety issues, fraudulent transactions, and operating inefficiencies. It mainly serves government clients and large enterprise customers across the energy, industrial, and financial sectors, and its top customer is the energy technology giant Baker Hughes.\n\nC3.ai initially only offered subscriptions, but it rolled out consumption-based fees in late 2022 to attract more customers as rising interest rates stirred up some fierce macro headwinds. That move reduced its recurring revenues and the stickiness of its ecosystem, but it broadened its market by reaching smaller and more budget-conscious customers.\n\nWhy were its last few years challenging?\n\nIn fiscal 2023 (which ended in April 2023), C3.ai's revenue only rose 6% as the competitive headwinds, a challenging macro environment, and the cannibalization of its subscriptions with its consumption-based fees throttled its growth. Its adjusted gross margin also dipped 2 percentage points to 77% as its pricing power waned.\n\nHowever, C3.ai's revenue rose 16% in fiscal 2024 and 25% in fiscal 2025. That acceleration was driven by its new federal contracts; fresh partnerships with Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and McKinsey; and its rollout of more modules for generative AI applications.\n\nIts adjusted gross margin dropped another 8 percentage points to 69% in fiscal 2024 as it relied on more low-margin pilot trials to attract more customers. But in fiscal 2025, that figure expanded to 70% as it converted more of those pilot programs into full-priced deployments. It also expanded its higher-margin subscriptions again.\n\nWhat happened to C3.ai over the past year?\n\nOver the past year, C3.ai's year-over-year revenue growth stabilized above 20% as its adjusted gross margins improved. That recovery was driven by declining interest rates, the growth of the AI market, and its broadening customer base.\n\nMetric Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Q3 2025 Q4 2025 Revenue growth (YOY) 20% 21% 29% 26% 26% Adjusted gross margin 69% 68% 70% 70% 71%\n\nMore importantly, C3.ai renewed its joint venture with Baker Hughes, which accounted for more than 30% of its revenue, for an additional three years. That renewal allayed some bearish concerns about C3.ai abruptly losing its top client before it could diversify its customer base.\n\nWhat will happen over the next year?\n\nC3.ai expects its revenue to rise 15%-25% in both the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and the full year. Analysts expect its revenue to increase 20% to $465 million for the full year. With a market cap of $3.5 billion, C3.ai's stock doesn't seem that expensive at 8 times this year's sales. But it isn't expected to break even anytime soon. At the beginning of fiscal 2024, it abandoned its near-term goal of turning profitable on an adjusted basis by the end of the year in favor of ramping up its investments in its AI-oriented modules.\n\nFor fiscal 2026, C3.ai expects to post an adjusted operating loss of $65 million-$100 million. That wouldn't be much of an improvement from its adjusted operating loss of $88 million in fiscal 2025. It will also likely continue to spend a lot of cash on its stock-based compensation expenses, which rose 7% to $231 million in fiscal 2025 and consumed 59% of its revenue. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, analysts expect its net loss to widen from $288 million in fiscal 2025 to $302 million in fiscal 2026.\n\nFor fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue to rise 19%. Assuming it meets those expectations and still trades at 8 times its forward sales, its stock price could rise about 26% to $33 over the next 12 months. That would be a decent gain, but it would remain far below its IPO price and likely underperform some of the market's higher-growth AI plays.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:31:55.395673+00:00"}

The stock’s recent ascent of over 61% in the past 30 days highlights the positive market reaction to these developments.\n\nBolstering Production Capacity\n\nJoby’s stock received a notable boost on Tuesday following the announcement of expanded manufacturing operations at its facilities in California and Ohio, alongside the addition of new aircraft to its fleet.\n\nThe company has effectively doubled its production capacity at the Marina, California site, which now spans 435,500 square feet.\n\nConcurrently, operations have been ramped up at its Dayton, Ohio facility, focusing on the production and testing of aircraft components.\n\nThis expansion is crucial for Joby’s push towards scaling commercial operations. The Marina site is projected to produce up to 24 aircraft per year, a significant step towards mass production.\n\nFurthermore, this facility will serve as a hub for flight testing, pilot training, and critical Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification processes.\n\nEric Allison, Joby’s Chief Product Officer, emphasized the company’s readiness for rapid scaling, noting the swift airworthiness certification of their sixth aircraft just one week after its completion.\n\nJoby also plans to leverage the renowned manufacturing expertise of Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), a key investor, to eventually build up to 500 aircraft annually at the Dayton facility.\n\nRegulatory Tailwinds Propel Growth\n\nThe positive momentum in Joby’s stock has been further amplified by a favorable shift in the regulatory landscape. On June 11, President Donald Trump’s new executive orders, aimed at reasserting America’s aviation leadership, provided a significant boost.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:31:59.322950+00:00"}

MongoDB is a developer-first, cloud-native NoSQL platform optimized for flexibility and speed, while Oracle is a long-established enterprise provider known for its robust relational databases and expanding multicloud presence.\n\n\n\nAs AI adoption and cloud migrations reshape data infrastructure, the key question for investors is: Which company is better positioned to capture the next wave of growth? Let’s break down the fundamentals and financials for both MDB and ORCL to see which stock deserves a spot in your portfolio.\n\nThe Case for MDB Stock\n\nMongoDB has been consistently gaining from the growing demand for AI-powered applications. Its flexible document model is a strong fit for handling fast-changing, unstructured data commonly used in AI. The company further strengthened its AI capabilities by acquiring Voyage AI. The latest release, Voyage 3.5, has helped improve embedding accuracy and cut storage costs by more than 80%.\n\n\n\nThe platform brings together real-time data, search and retrieval into one system, allowing developers to avoid complicated integrations. MongoDB’s tools are already in use at companies like LG Uplus, where they support thousands of agents with quicker and more accurate responses, boosting their standing in the AI space.\n\n\n\nMongoDB has also been growing its partner ecosystem. It recently added backup integrations with Rubrik and Cohesity, improving data protection for enterprise customers, especially those using hybrid cloud setups. These partnerships highlight MongoDB’s focus on enterprise-grade reliability, adding to the momentum around the platform’s broader adoption.\n\n\n\nIn the quarter, MongoDB generated $549 million in revenues, growing 22% year over year. Atlas revenues increased 26% year over year and represented 72% of total revenues. Non-GAAP operating income was $87 million, with net income of $86 million and free cash flow of $106 million.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings is pinned at 64 cents per share, which has remained steady over the past 30 days. The estimate indicates a year-over-year decline of 8.57%.\n\nMongoDB, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nMongoDB, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nMongoDB, Inc. price-consensus-chart | MongoDB, Inc. Quote\n\nThe Case for ORCL Stock\n\nOracle has been expanding its cloud database business through offerings like Autonomous Database and Oracle Database 23AI. These products allow customers to run databases not only on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure but also across Azure, AWS and Google Cloud through its multicloud partnerships.\n\n\n\nThe company has focused on AI-readiness by integrating vector search into its database stack. Oracle stated that Oracle 23AI enables customer data to be accessed by large language models while preserving privacy and security. As AI adoption grows, Oracle believes its database will become increasingly central to enterprise infrastructure.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Oracle reported that cloud database services grew 31% year over year, with Autonomous Database consumption revenues up 47%. Cloud database services were reported to have an annualized revenue run rate of $2.6 billion.\n\n\n\nHowever, Oracle’s database business is under pressure as cloud migration accelerates and legacy revenue streams weaken. In fiscal 2025, database license support grew just 7%. A large portion of revenues remains tied to on-premise deployments, making Oracle vulnerable as customers shift to cloud-native alternatives. Its $21.2 billion in capital spending led to negative free cash flow of $400 million. Additionally, operating across multiple clouds adds complexity and increases reliance on rival platforms.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter earnings is pinned at $1.47 per share, which has remained steady over the past 30 days.

Netflix’s customer loyalty speaks for itself.  Oracle and Broadcom are benefiting from the ramp-up in AI infrastructure spending among hyperscalers.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/15/3-red-hot-growth-stocks-to-buy-now/", "published_at": "2025-07-15T08:15:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "So far in 2025, Netflix (NFLX 0.55%), Oracle (ORCL 0.47%), and Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%) have skyrocketed 39.7%, 38.4%, and 18.4%, respectively, compared to a 6.4% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.13%).\n\nHere's why these red-hot growth stocks have more room to run in the second half of the year despite their expensive valuations.\n\nNetflix is in a league of its own among streaming platforms\n\nIn 2013, CNBC's Jim Cramer popularized the term \"FANG stocks\" -- referring to Facebook (now Meta Platforms), Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet) -- tech companies he singled out for attention due to their explosive growth potential and market-beating gains. And while Netflix had an impeccable run-up in the following years, the original FANG group lost a lot of its luster in 2022 when all four stocks fell by between 39.1% and 64.2% -- with Netflix tumbling 51.1%.\n\nBut Netflix has come roaring back. The stock has more than doubled since the start of 2022 -- rewarding those investors who held on with sizable gains even when factoring in that steep sell-off.\n\nNow sporting a $529.9 billion market cap, Netflix has reached a size that will make it more difficult for its stock to produce life-changing gains to shareholders. But that doesn't mean Netflix can't be a solid investment going forward.\n\nIn years past, too much of Netflix's massive production budget often went toward shows that weren't received well by audiences, but its occasional big hits would essentially make up for the duds. However, the company has figured out a secret sauce that keeps users engaged with a variety of content that appeals to different audiences across entertainment categories.\n\nNetflix is a much stronger company today because it doesn't rely as much on hit shows. It still has its share of hits, but the real differentiator has been improving the overall quality of its content slate.\n\nGiven the stock has run up just under 40% year to date, Netflix will have a lot to prove when it reports earnings on Thursday.\n\nThe company needs to continue growing its top line while sustaining high margins. There's also ongoing pressure from consumers, who are tightening their spending. But so far, Netflix has been able to raise prices and retain subscribers. As long as Netflix can continue driving home that loyalty, the stock should continue to be a solid long-term investment. But if not, the stock's lofty valuation could look overextended, and investors may turn sour on the stock.\n\nOracle is capitalizing on AI investment through subscription services\n\nOracle has soared by 222% in the last three years. It's part of a cohort of legacy tech companies (like Cisco Systems, International Business Machines, etc.) whose stock prices stagnated for years, but that have lately climbed toward their highest levels in decades. These companies are benefiting from the general uplift of the artificial intelligence (AI) trend across the tech sector through their networking and data services.\n\nBut Oracle has taken the transformation a step further by revolutionizing its business model.\n\nThe company provides software, platform, and infrastructure cloud services to customers for data management, building and maintaining infrastructure and databases, computing, networking, and other subscription services (including handling AI workloads). The results have been astounding.\n\nIn Oracle's fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ended May 31, the company reported a 27% jump in infrastructure-as-a-service and software-as-a-service cloud revenue. Management expects its revenue from applications plus infrastructure cloud revenue to increase by 40% in fiscal 2026 compared to the 24% growth booked in fiscal 2025.\n\nOracle is attracting database revenue from hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) Azure -- a reliable customer base since these companies and their peers have committed to aggressive AI capital expenditures.\n\nLike Netflix, Oracle isn't cheap, but its 34.1 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is reasonable if the company can keep delivering results.\n\nBroadcom serves a vital role in data centers\n\nBroadcom is yet another company at the cross-section of network connectivity and AI. It's a giant in the areas of networking, storage, broadband, and cybersecurity. But it also provides cloud infrastructure services and infrastructure software thanks to its acquisition of VMware in late 2023.\n\nHowever, the key driver behind Broadcom's soaring stock price and its rise to a $1.29 trillion market cap is its custom AI chip business.\n\nBroadcom's XPUs are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) custom-made to handle AI workloads. These chips are playing a major role in the buildout of AI data centers.\n\nTraditionally, data centers relied on central processing units (CPUs) to perform most computing tasks. Graphics processing units (GPUs), like those made by Nvidia, are parallel processors, capable of performing certain types of complex tasks faster -- among them, parsing large datasets. Because the heaviest parts of AI workloads can only be handled efficiently by parallel processors, GPUs and similar chips are becoming the gold standard of modern data centers.\n\nBroadcom's XPUs are serving unique functions in data centers. These purpose-built chips aren't as flexible as GPUs, and are usually deployed for specific known AI workloads. But they are ideally suited for hyperscalers that are looking to reduce the costs of running large language models.\n\nFor example, Google Cloud works with Broadcom to make its custom-designed AI accelerator Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). TPUs power applications like Google Search, Photos, and Maps, as well as Google's AI chatbot, Gemini.\n\nWhen deployed correctly, Broadcom's chips can reduce server operators' energy costs and run faster than GPUs. Broadcom sees sustained demand for XPUs from key hyperscale customers. As long as these customers keep aggressively spending on AI, it's likely that Broadcom's earnings will continue to impress.\n\nBroadcom's valuation has gone up substantially to a lofty 41.4 forward P/E. So the stock should only be a buy for those who are confident that the AI infrastructure investment cycle will persist for quite some time.\n\nRed-hot for all the right reasons\n\nNetflix, Oracle, and Broadcom can continue running higher because they have clear paths toward earnings growth.\n\nNetflix has separated itself from its streaming rivals by developing a formula for producing content with the quality, quantity, and variety to appeal to a diverse group of viewers. Once thought of as a discretionary expense, a Netflix subscription has become a borderline staple for many households. That status should help Netflix produce solid results even during economic downturns.\n\nOracle and Broadcom have established footholds in existing industries but are also directly benefiting from hyperscalers' spending to keep up with AI-driven demand. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are ramping up their spending on AI, and chances are, a good chunk of that spending will go to companies like Oracle and Broadcom. However, their links to those key customers could prove to be a double-edged sword -- if the hyperscalers pull back on spending, it would sap Oracle and Broadcom's results and could cause both stocks to sell off.\n\nNetflix, Oracle, and Broadcom are expensive because all three companies are executing. But it would be best to only consider buying these stocks if you have a long-term horizon for your investments, because their elevated valuations make them vulnerable to significant sell-offs if investor sentiment turns negative.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:32:19.981090+00:00"}

(BTBT) the Best AI Stock to Buy Under $10?\n\nA team of technicians working on a server of bitcoin mining equipment in a data center.\n\nIREN Limited (IREN) presents a unique opportunity centered on the monetization of its energy and land assets, with time-to-power emerging as a critical advantage in the age of AI infrastructure. As hyperscalers like Oracle search for multiple 1GW+ ready sites by 2026, IREN’s secured 3GW pipeline and near-term readiness place it among the very few positioned to capitalize.\n\nStrong data center rent growth and industry reports show power access has overtaken fiber and labor as the top site constraint, reinforcing IREN’s edge. Its Horizon 1 & 2 projects could generate $125M in EBITDA, worth $1.2B ($5.5/share) at precedent valuations.\n\nAdditionally, IREN’s 47MW of redundant, low-latency capacity in Canada could be converted into AI cloud infrastructure, potentially unlocking $1.9B ($8.5/share) in value if GPU financing is secured and utilization remains high.\n\nBitcoin mining remains a cash flow engine, with up to $650M in EBITDA depending on network dynamics. Low-cost power (~3.5¢/kWh) gives IREN a cost advantage, translating to $3.3M–8.5M/MW in value from energy savings alone—especially as onsite generation becomes a strategic necessity. Adjusting for $820M in convertible debt ($3.6/share) and $150M in corporate overhead ($6.5/share), IREN’s sum-of-the-parts value remains attractive.\n\nIts existing infrastructure is worth ~$16/share, and if its energy pipeline is monetized at $6M–12M/MW, potential value rises to $98–$196/share. Horizon’s model illustrates how $350M in cost can be turned into $900M–$1.5B in value, capturing up to $20M/MW.\n\nWith risks like AI demand volatility and Bitcoin price swings acknowledged, IREN’s optionality and structural advantage in power access underpin a powerful investment case.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on IREN Limited (IREN) by Anxious-Criticism652 in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s pivot from Bitcoin mining to becoming an AI cloud and quantum infrastructure player, backed by a debt-free balance sheet and modular, scalable compute design. The company's stock price has appreciated by approximately 78% since our coverage. This is because the market began recognizing IREN’s infrastructure value and hybrid AI/crypto strategy.

Spending on software that includes generative AI for supply chains, capable of learning and even performing tasks on its own, could hit $55 billion by 2029, up from $2.7 billion now, according to U.S. research firm Gartner, driven in part by global uncertainties.\n\nHYPE\n\n\"The tool just puts up in front of you: 'I think you can take 100 tonnes of this product from this plant to transfer it to that plant. And you just hit accept if that makes sense (to you),\" McKinsey supply chain consultant Matt Jochim said.\n\nThe biggest providers of overall supply chain software by revenue are Germany's SAP, U.S. firms Oracle, Coupa and Microsoft and Blue Yonder, a unit of Panasonic, according to Gartner.\n\nGenerative AI is in its infancy, with most firms still piloting it spending modest amounts, industry experts say.\n\nThose investments can climb to tens of millions of dollars when deployed at scale, including the use of tools known as AI agents, which make their own decisions and often need costly upgrades to data management and other IT systems, they said.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:56:09.803220+00:00"}

Sridhar attributed margin gains to fiscal discipline in cost management and level-loaded manufacturing, noting that quarterly variability could occur due to product mix and volume.\n\nMichael (JPMorgan, for Mark Strouse) requested specifics on the timeline and funding for the planned capacity expansion. Sridhar responded that Bloom can add factory capacity “in months” and that the estimated $100 million investment is already funded.\n\nDavid Keith Arcaro (Morgan Stanley) asked whether the Oracle partnership could accelerate additional hyperscaler deals.
