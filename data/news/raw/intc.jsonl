Investing in these companies is a genius move, as they are vital.\n\nOne of them, in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm, is ASML (ASML 2.81%). ASML makes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines used in the chip manufacturing process. Without ASML, the advanced chip technology used today wouldn't be possible. As a result, it's one of the most important companies in the world.\n\nHowever, ASML's stock is flat year to date and down around 35% from its all-time high. With other tech giants constantly hitting new all-time highs in the current market, is ASML well positioned to do the same?\n\nASML's machines are used by foundries worldwide\n\nASML's technology is vital for cutting-edge chip fabricators. The chip foundry industry has only three major players: Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, and Samsung. Taiwan Semiconductor has been the biggest winner by far and is constructing new fabrication facilities worldwide to meet rising chip demand, driven by AI, including a $165 billion investment in the U.S. alone. Demand for ASML machines is mainly coming from Taiwan Semi, because the other two have been losing business.\n\nIt's no secret that Intel's foundry business has struggled. It's currently losing money, and Intel's CEO has indicated that it isn't willing to invest heavily in the business in an attempt to revitalize it. It will invest in capacity only if it can find a customer first.\n\nConsidering Intel's poor track record in the foundry business recently, this is a terrible idea, as Intel needs to showcase its prowess before it can take such an approach. Intel's business will likely continue to deteriorate, which causes a headwind for ASML amid less demand for its cutting-edge machines.\n\nSamsung isn't seeing as much success as TSMC, but it's also not struggling like Intel. Samsung has invested in new plants and recently partnered with Tesla to produce its AI6 chips. This partnership could cause increased demand, leading to more ASML machines being purchased.\n\nWith some of ASML's major customers not needing the capacity and TSMC, which is known for pushing ASML's machines to their technological limits, sometimes reluctant to upgrade them, the future isn't as bright for ASML as one might expect.\n\nThis pessimism showed up in ASML's financial results. Before Q2 earnings, management was adamant that 2026 would be a growth year, just as it had expected 2025 to be. Now management is taking this stance: \"While we are still preparing for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage.\"\n\nThat's concerning for investors, which is why ASML's stock has done so poorly. However, the outlook beyond 2026 is still bright, and long-term investors (those willing to hold for at least five years) should still be excited about the stock.\n\nASML's long-term outlook is still intact\n\nOne of the reasons ASML gave that 2026 might not be a growth year was uncertainty about tariffs. ASML is based in the Netherlands, so it is a potential target of U.S. tariffs. Management's commentary regarding 2026 was given before the U.S. and European Union reached a trade deal, so this outlook may shift now that a trade deal framework has been reached.\n\nRegardless, management's long-term outlook of revenue between 44 billion euros and 60 billion euros by 2030 hasn't shifted, so whether the growth comes in 2026 or beyond is irrelevant as long as you're patient.\n\nOver the past 12 months, ASML's revenue totaled 32.2 billion euros, so ASML's revenue could come in at the high end of the projection over the next five years. If it does, there's no doubt that ASML will be a market-crushing stock.\n\nIf ASML's revenue comes in on the lower end of that guidance, though, ASML's returns could lag the market's, making it a poor stock pick. Time will tell which of these paths ASML's stock takes, but considering the sheer demand for chips and the stabilization of trade relations, I think it's likely that ASML will come in on the high end of that range, making it an excellent stock to buy today.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:20:50.444359+00:00"}

So severe was the drop in some stocks that many continue to lag the performance of the S&P 500 in 2025 despite dramatic recoveries.\n\nFortunately, a few have managed to outperform the index. Moreover, some even remain solid buys. Investors looking for AI stocks that can continue to perform should consider these names.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nIn a sense, the performance of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%) may not come as a surprise. The company dominates advanced semiconductor manufacturing, as competitors such as Samsung and Intel failed to match its technical prowess.\n\nConsequently, top chip design companies such as Nvidia and Apple outsource most manufacturing to TSMC, which holds a 68% market share in the third-party foundry market. Since such companies cannot run AI workloads without its chips, TSMC is one of the most essential companies in the AI industry.\n\nSo, it is little wonder that Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI chip industry of 29% through 2030. This means that doubts about the economy are much less likely to affect TSMC.\n\nIndeed, one can find little that is sluggish about TSMC's performance. In the first half of 2025, it generated nearly $56 billion in revenue, a 40% increase from year-ago levels. Over the same period, costs and expenses rose 24%. Thus, its net income of almost $24 billion was 60% higher than in the first two quarters of 2024.\n\nIt sells at a P/E ratio of 28. That valuation is unlikely to deter investors, considering its rapid growth, and should translate into gains for TSMC stock over time.\n\nUpstart Holdings\n\nThe fact that Upstart Holdings (UPST 0.02%) is a market beater so far in 2025 may come as a surprise. Its stock lost 19% of its value following Q2 earnings. Additionally, it had posted net losses for years before the current quarter. At one point in the 2022 bear market, it had even lost 97% of its value.\n\nNonetheless, Upstart is worth following, especially considering its ability to transform the credit scoring market. Fair Isaac's FICO score, the industry standard, has not had a major update since 1989.\n\nIn contrast, Upstart's model leverages AI to consider attributes overlooked by FICO. It trained its model on over 90 million data points and is working to increase its advantage in AI during the year. Such efforts have helped it uncover loan opportunities overlooked by FICO without adding to lender default risks.\n\nMoreover, amid a sluggish economy, the Fed appears poised to lower interest rates, which should encourage more consumers to take out loans. So far, it mainly scores personal loans, but expanding into auto and home equity loans should significantly broaden its addressable market.\n\nDue to a modest profit in Q2, Upstart has earned only $3.1 million this year. Still, revenue of $426 million in the first half of the year is up 59% yearly.\n\nAlso, recent losses temporarily left it without a price-to-earnings ratio. Still, considering its revenue growth, investors are likely to perceive its forward P/E ratio of 39 as reasonable, making it feasible for interested investors to cash in on this potentially lucrative opportunity.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nAnother company banking heavily on AI is social media giant Meta Platforms (META 3.16%). Over 42% of the world's population uses at least one of its social media sites daily.\n\nAmid such saturation, its user base growth slowed to 6%. Thus, to maintain rapid revenue growth over the long term, it leveraged its treasure trove of personal data to help clients train AI models.\n\nIn 2025 alone, it pledged between $66 billion and $72 billion in capital expenditure (capex) to compete in this space, investing heavily in technical improvements and data center capacity to maintain its leadership.\n\nAdditionally, digital advertising continues to drive growth for now. In the first two quarters of 2025, Meta generated $90 billion in revenue, 19% more than the same period last year. In comparison, costs and expenses grew 10% over the same time, allowing its $35 billion in profit for the first half of the year to rise by 36%.\n\nDespite those increases, Meta's stock sells for around 28 times earnings. Considering its rapid growth and growing role in AI, that valuation should make Meta stock attractive to prospective shareholders.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:20:51.808027+00:00"}

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 11 days ago when the stock dropped 24.6% on the news that the company issued a weak financial outlook for the third quarter and lowered its full-year revenue forecast. The disappointing guidance overshadowed second-quarter results that beat analyst expectations. For the upcoming third quarter, Magnachip projected revenue between $44 million and $48 million, far below the consensus estimate of $54.2 million. The company also slashed its full-year outlook from single-digit growth to flat revenue, blaming a difficult macroeconomic environment and tariff uncertainty. This news coincided with a broader market sell-off after a weak U.S. jobs report and new tariff announcements rattled investors, particularly in the semiconductor sector. Following the report, at least one analyst lowered their price target on the stock.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:21:02.846175+00:00"}

The president late Monday said on this Truth Social platform that the meeting was \"very interesting\" and that Tan's success is \"an amazing story.\" Trump said that members of his cabinet would continue meeting with Tan in the coming days.\n\nTrump’s meeting with the once-storied American chipmaker’s CEO followed news on Monday that AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have agreed to pay 15% of their China chip revenues to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses.\n\nIntel shares were up 5% at $21.75 in late trading Tuesday, adding to the previous session's gain of 3.5%. The stock is up about 9% so far this year, roughly in line with the performance of the S&P 500 in 2025 as investors asses the impact of Tan’s strategic moves, which include divesting assets, reducing employees, and reallocating resources. Tan took over the CEO role in March.\n\nBelow, we take a closer look at Intel’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching.\n\nBuying Interest Near Multi-Month Trading Floor\n\nAfter breaking down from an ascending channel late last month, Intel shares retraced to a multi-month trading floor before finding buying interest around this key location.\n\nMore recently, the stock has continued to move higher, though the price remains below the 50- and 200-day moving averages and the relative strength index sits just below its neutral reading. However, it’s worth noting that the shares registered their highest volume in more than two weeks on Monday, indicating growing interest in the chipmaker’s stock.\n\nLet’s identify key overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares continue their recent upward momentum and also point out a major support level worth monitoring during future retracements.\n\nKey Overhead Areas to Watch\n\nThe first overhead area to watch sits around $22, currently just above the key moving averages. This location will likely attract significant attention on the chart near a horizontal line that stretches back to last August’s prominent stock gap.\n\nA decisive close above this price could see the stock climb to the $24 area. The shares may face selling pressure here near a range of corresponding price action on the chart between September and July.\n\nBuying through this area opens the door for a retest of resistance near $26. Investors who have bought the stock at lower prices could look for exit points around major peaks that formed on the chart in November, February and March.\n\nMajor Support Level Worth Monitoring\n\nDuring future retracements in Intel’s share price, it’s worth keeping a close eye on the $19 level. This region on the chart would likely provide strong support near multiple troughs that mark the stock’s multi-month trading floor.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

While it broke ground in 2022, the project has been beset by delays and likely now will not open until 2030 or later.\n\nTrump said he met with Tan, along with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. His cabinet members and Tan were going to bring suggestions to him next week, Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"His success and rise is an amazing story,\" Trump said about Tan.\n\nTan had invested in hundreds of Chinese firms, some of which were linked to the Chinese military, Reuters reported exclusively in April.

In social media posts on Aug. 8, the president initially labeled Tan as \"highly conflicted\" over alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party, citing illegal actions by Cadence Design Systems (CDNS 1.24%) while Tan was its CEO as the proof. After the two met on Monday, Trump now calls Tan a \"success,\" and supports his leadership of the chip giant.\n\nThe conflicting attention on Tan brought additional scrutiny on the semiconductor stock as it struggles to regain its competitiveness in an industry it once dominated. It also means investors would be well advised to make sense of the news and the implications it might have for Intel shareholders before buying the stock.\n\nLip-Bu Tan and China\n\nThe initial issue arose after Cadence pleaded guilty on July 28 to unlawfully exporting its semiconductor design tools to a Chinese chip manufacturer and a university with ties to the Chinese military. Tan was Cadence's CEO when these transfers occurred.\n\nOn Aug. 6, Arkansas's Republican Senator, Tom Cotton, sent a letter to Intel's Chairman of the Board Frank Yeary, asking questions about Tan's China ties. President Trump learned of Cotton's letter soon after, and on Trump Media's Truth Social platform, he called on Tan to resign \"immediately.\" He stated that there was \"no other solution to this problem\" but did not provide any additional details.\n\nTan countered Cotton's accusations, releasing a letter to Intel employees on Thursday, Aug. 7, stating that there had been \"misinformation\" circulating about his past roles at Walden International and Cadence Design Systems. He also affirmed his dedication to U.S. security interests and mentioned Intel's discussions with the Trump administration regarding the issues raised.\n\nIntel's board of directors also released a statement supporting Tan and emphasizing the board's commitment to U.S. security and economic interests, noting that Intel's investments, including domestic manufacturing, align with President Trump's stated agenda.\n\nTan then visited Trump at the White House to make this case. An Intel spokesperson described the meeting as a \"candid and constructive discussion,\" outlining the commitment Intel has made to bolstering U.S. leadership in manufacturing and technology. Trump responded by hailing Tan's success and rise as an \"amazing story,\" adding that Tan will spend time with members of Trump's administrative cabinet and bring suggestions to him over the next week.\n\nShareholder implications\n\nIntel's stock price recovered after releasing the news. Nonetheless, the challenges that Tan faces in getting Intel back on track remain considerable.\n\nIntel's board hired Tan back in March 2025 specifically to turn the company around. After decades of industry leadership, it has fallen behind its top competitors in recent years. Efforts by past CEOs to resolve Intel's issues have so far proven unsuccessful.\n\nIn 2021, former CEO Pat Gelsinger put forth a plan to regain the technical lead by 2025 and turn its foundries into a third-party chip manufacturing business. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators thwarted the company's plans to catch up technically, and its efforts to upgrade foundries were beset with setbacks, prompting Gelsinger to leave the company last year.\n\nWhen Intel's board appointed Tan, it likely hoped that Tan could replicate his previous success at Cadence. Since taking the job, he has streamlined the management team, and now the client group and the data center and AI group report directly to him. Additionally, he elevated Intel's technical leadership and began the process of reducing the workforce to approximately 75,000 employees by the end of the year (a one-year staff reduction of over 30%).\n\nTan has made it clear that a comeback will take years. It's still far too early if his initiatives will succeed. So far, its financials suggest little has changed. Revenue for the second quarter of 2025 was $12.9 billion, amounting to flat growth from year-ago levels. There has also been a considerable increase in costs and expenses, and Intel's Q2 net loss widened to $2.9 billion.\n\nStill, the fact that Tan persuaded Trump to reverse course is undoubtedly a victory for the CEO. Additionally, its price-to-book ratio is just over 0.9. Since that means Intel stock is worth less than its assets minus its liabilities, one has to assume its troubles are more than priced into the stock.\n\nShould investors buy the pullback in Intel stock?\n\nIntel was arguably a speculative buy before this recent news and likely remains so. Indeed, the company faced considerable uncertainty before Trump initially turned on Tan. Although Tan has averted a crisis by winning over Trump, Intel still faces an uphill battle in making the venerable tech giant competitive.\n\nHowever, with its price-to-book ratio under 1, Intel is unlikely to have further downside without conditions worsening further. Thus, the news probably just gives investors more time and reason to initiate a speculative Intel position.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:21:14.041128+00:00"}

That supports \"an insurance rate cut in September.\"\n\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote that evidence of tariff pass-through to consumers \"is not significant enough to ring alarm bells.\" However, she adds that tariff inflation concerns are \"likely to grow over the coming months, meaning that inflationary pressures are likely to pick up just as the Fed starts to resume rate cuts.\"\n\n8:52 a.m. ET\n\nFed Rate-Cut Outlook\n\nAfter the CPI inflation report, odds of a Sept. 17 Fed rate cut climbed to 90% from 82%. Now markets are tilting slightly toward 75 basis points in rate cuts in the final three Fed meetings of 2025, with odds up to 52% from 42% ahead of the data.\n\n8:50 a.m. ET\n\nSome Impact From Trump Tariffs\n\nMotor vehicle parts and equipment prices rose 0.9% on the month and 2.9% from a year ago, which was the most in a year. Motor vehicle maintenance and repair prices rose 6.5% from a year ago, the most since May 2024.\n\n8:47 a.m. ET\n\nMedical Service Prices Jump\n\nMedical care services prices rose 0.8%, the most since September 2022. That came as dental services prices jumped 2.6%, the biggest monthly increase on record. Hospital prices rose 0.5%.\n\n8:40 a.m. ET\n\nServices Inflation Warms Up, Goods Inflation Tame\n\nThe July CPI data saw core inflation overshoot, but not because of tariffs. The surprise appeared to be from a pickup in services inflation as airfares rose 4%, the most in two years.\n\nIn goods categories, prices of major appliances fell 2.2%. Apparel prices inched up 0.1%. New vehicle prices were flat, while used cars and trucks rose 0.5%.\n\n8:38 a.m. ET\n\nS&P 500 Futures Rise\n\nS&P 500 futures rose 0.5% following the CPI report, despite the core inflation reading picking up more than expected. The 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 4.28% vs. 4.27% on Monday.\n\n8:36 a.m. ET\n\nSmall Business Optimism Improves\n\nThe NFIB Small Business Optimism Index, released at 6 a.m. ET, rose 1.7 points in July to 100.3. Economists had expected a slim rise to 98.9. The survey showed small business owners more upbeat about the health of their business and the future. Just 11% said inflation was their biggest problem, unchanged from June's lowest reading since September 2021.\n\n8:33 a.m. ET\n\nCPI Inflation Data\n\nThe overall CPI rose 0.2% in July, in line with 0.2% forecasts. The 12-month headline inflation rate held at 2.7%, which was below 2.8% forecasts.\n\nThe core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3%, matching forecasts. However, the 12-month core inflation rate rose to 3.1%, above 3% estimates.\n\nModest Impact From Trump Tariffs So Far\n\nA surge in imports before Trump tariffs took effect delayed the need for retailers to hike prices. While price hikes showed up in the June data, with a 1.8% monthly rise in prices for sports equipment and 1.8% bump in toy prices, services inflation has been pretty tame.\n\nHotel and motel room rates fell 3.7% from a year ago in June, while airline fares have slipped 0.7% over the past 12 months.\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics noted that Adobe's Digital Price Index data points to \"a slowing pass-through from the tariffs to consumer prices\" in July, though the economists aren't fully buying it.\n\nUsed car prices are something of a wild card, after falling 0.7% in June. Both Manheim and JD Power data suggest higher used car prices in July data.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWhy This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks\n\nCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSurge\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nHow To Invest: Rules For When To Buy And Sell Stocks In Bull And Bear Markets", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:21:20.645738+00:00"}

ASML expects this growth to be driven by both an increase in Low Numerical Aperture (NA) EUV capacity and initial shipments of High NA systems. Moreover, advanced customers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung, and Intel, are expected to add around 30% more EUV capacity compared with 2024, which would further contribute to its revenue growth target.\n\nThe higher productivity NXE:3800E systems, which are now shipping at full specification of 220 wafers per hour configuration, will allow its customers to expand capacity with the same number of systems but at higher average selling prices, resulting in improved margins. In DRAM manufacturing, these systems replace complex multi-patterning deep ultraviolet (DUV) steps with single EUV exposures, reducing cost, shortening cycle times, and improving yields.\n\nAdditionally, demand is being driven by artificial intelligence (AI) applications, which are driving investment in both logic and memory chips. Logic customers are adding leading-edge node capacity, and DRAM customers are adding more EUV layers to their latest and future nodes.\n\nASML has also shipped its first EXE:5200B High NA system, which is designed for high-volume manufacturing and offers about 60% higher productivity than the EXE:5000, and is expected to contribute to the 2025 EUV revenue growth target.\n\nASML faces risks arising from macroeconomic uncertainties, rising geopolitical tensions and tariffs, which could hurt the timing of customer spending. Despite these risks, ASML expects total revenue growth for 2025 to be around 15%, supported by the product mix shift toward advanced logic and DRAM production using advanced EUV lithography systems. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ASML’s 2025 revenues is pegged at $37.83 billion, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 23.8%.\n\nHow Competitors Fare Against ASML\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) and KLA Corporation (KLAC) are also key players in advanced chipmaking tools. Applied Materials supplies equipment used in chip fabrication, especially for patterning and deposition steps that can complement or compete with EUV. KLA, on the other hand, focuses on process control and metrology, where its tools are vital in ensuring chip quality.\n\nBoth companies benefit from growing semiconductor complexity and are investing in next-generation technologies. While they don’t manufacture EUV systems, they are critical to the same ecosystem and could benefit from an AI-driven push for smaller, more complex nodes that support ASML’s EUV growth.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:21:22.578998+00:00"}

Does Donald Trump fall into the \"personalist\" autocrat category? (Credit: AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, Pool, Mark Schiefelbein, File)\n\nIt seems Donald Trump wants to be king of everything. Telling Coca-Cola how to make Coke and Fed Chair Jerome Powell how to make monetary policy. Overseeing the curriculum and anti-antisemitism rules of some of the world’s best universities. Deciding which industries the United States needs to repatriate from Canada and elsewhere. Choosing double-digit tariff rates for trading partners seemingly on a whim. Drawing new borders for Ukraine. Turning Gaza into a resort. Asking Intel to fire its CEO because he’s supposedly too close to China. Skimming 15 per cent off the top of Nvidia Corp. chips sold to that same China under restored export licences. Musing about who should be mayor of New York and running the District of Columbia all on his own.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal’s Holman Jenkins, Jr., figures Trump will soon weigh in on the NFL’s purchase of a 10 per cent interest in ESPN. And why not? It’s in the news. This president apparently feels that if something is in the news, he has a stake in it. Every news cycle — and they’re down to about 90 minutes each now — brings something Trump.\n\nEven we who disagree with much of what Trump does and all of how he does it have to admire the energy of this 79-year-old dynamo. A new study suggests, however, that a little less presidential energy and a lot more forbearance might be better for the U.S. economy.\n\nThe study is by Christopher Blattman and Scott Gehlbach of the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy and Zeyang Yu of Princeton’s politics department. The three take up the age-old question of whether democracies out-perform autocracies in terms of economic growth. They find that the data (on more than 150 countries from 1960 to 2010) suggest democracies don’t actually produce a growth premium — though since economics isn’t everything and freedom isn’t explicitly priced in the national accounts, that doesn’t mean we should be indifferent to whether we live in one or not.\n\nBut, the researchers found, some autocracies do produce systematically inferior economic outcomes. In particular, those dominated by strong personalities — the likes of Saddam Hussein, Mobutu Sese Seko, Nicolás Maduro and Vladimir Putin — do more poorly, even after controlling for the fact that “personalist” autocrats may be more likely to emerge in countries already experiencing economic difficulty.\n\nThe raw difference in annual growth rates between democracies and “institutionalized” autocracies, on the one hand, and personalist autocracies, on the other, is about a percentage point. That may not sound like much. But, as the authors point out, compound one per cent economic growth over 50 years and you’re talking two-thirds higher income.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:21:37.441589+00:00"}

It's very complicated subject,\" Trump said.\n\nThe reclassification, specifically moving marijuana to a Schedule III drug classification, would ease federal restrictions and potentially make the multibillion-dollar cannabis industry more profitable. This is because it would allow cannabis companies to take normal business tax deductions, a benefit they are currently denied under the existing tax code.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:21:40.140838+00:00"}

Nvidia shares were little changed.\n\nChina’s government, meanwhile, has grown increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese firms deploying the H20 and is unlikely to warm to the idea of a chip tax. Yuyuantantian, a social media account affiliated with state-run China Central Television that regularly signals Beijing’s thinking about trade, on Sunday slammed what it described as security vulnerabilities and inefficiencies of Nvidia’s chip.\n\nThere’s no guarantee the arrangement with Nvidia and AMD will succeed. Trade experts said it’s vulnerable to legal challenges because it could be construed as an export tax, something that’s not allowed under the Constitution. The chipmakers themselves said it will take months to revive production of the parts — assuming Chinese customers even opt for dated components.\n\nThe chip companies’ consent to cede part of chip sales underscores the urgency of their desire to cater to customers in the world’s second-largest economy. The US government has cut off sales of the most capable AI chips, arguing that China might use them for military purposes, instead allowing shipment of only pared-back products. But the Trump administration has consistently relented on trade conditions in exchange for financial concessions — and in this case officials said the chips are not the most advanced, playing down their national security implications.\n\nTrump said he’d originally told Nvidia that he wanted a 20% cut for the US if he cleared H20 sales to China but eventually settled for a 15% share. The two negotiated “a little deal,” he said.\n\nNvidia plans to share 15% of the revenue from sales of its H20 AI accelerator in China, US President Donald Trump said in a briefing with reporters on Monday. AMD will deliver the same share from MI308 revenues, a person familiar with the situation said, asking not to be identified discussing internal deliberations.\n\nNvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from Chinese AI chip sales to the US government in an unusual, legally questionable deal that reflects the Trump administration’s willingness to soften export controls in exchange for financial payouts.\n\nStory Continues\n\n“Both Nvidia and AMD already said they would start shipping to China, so that market reaction already happened,” said Jay Goldberg, an analyst at Seaport Global Securities. The big question is exactly when they’re going to start delivering to China again, especially now that there are strings attached, Goldberg said.\n\nThe deal also threatens to undermine the US argument that some trade controls are necessary to safeguard national security, said Jacob Feldgoise, a researcher at the DC-based Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “This seeming quid pro quo is unprecedented from an export-control perspective,” he said. “The arrangement risks invalidating the national security rationale for US export controls.”\n\nWATCH: Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China to the US government. Tom Mackenzie has the details.Source: Bloomberg\n\nWhen the Trump administration first decided to grant export licenses to Nvidia and AMD last month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said exports of H20 chips were part of trade talks with China and were used as “a negotiating chip.” White House AI adviser David Sacks emphasized at the time that the product wasn’t “the latest and greatest.”\n\nTrump reiterated these points at the briefing on Monday, calling Nvidia’s H20 “an old chip” and hailing the company’s latest Blackwell chip as the “super duper advanced” one. He signaled though that he’d be open to negotiate another deal with Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to sell a scaled-back version of the most advanced Blackwell chip to China, too. “I think he’s coming to see me again about that,” Trump said.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said the company follows US export rules, adding that while it hasn’t shipped H20 chips to China for months, it hopes the regulations will allow US companies to compete in China. AMD similarly said in a statement Monday that it’s adhering to all US export-control laws.\n\nThe US government has meanwhile begun approving export licenses for the chips. AMD’s initial license applications have been cleared, the company said Monday. The Financial Times earlier reported on the revenue-sharing deal.\n\nTrump has targeted chipmakers in the past week with a series of declarations that were light on specifics and rattled companies from Silicon Valley to Asia. On Wednesday, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on imported chips, unless companies also made investments on US soil. On examination, though, those new tariffs would apply to almost no one since most major chipmakers appear to be covered by existing investments or separate trade deals.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump called on Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan to resign, describing the Malaysia-born entrepreneur as “highly conflicted” without giving details. Tan, who sent a letter to employees assuring them that he had engaged with the administration, is expected to meet with Trump on Monday, a person familiar with the situation said. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the meeting.\n\nTan has been targeted by Republican Senator Tom Cotton over historical business ties to China.\n\nHuang has lobbied long and hard for the lifting of restrictions, arguing that walling China off will only slow the spread of American technology and encourage local rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co. In yet another sign that his message is getting through to the White House, Trump described Huang on Monday as a “great,” “very brilliant guy.”\n\nThe tax is expected to funnel some capital to the US — but not an enormous amount in relative terms. Both Nvidia and AMD have said it’ll take time to ramp back up production of their China-specific products — even if order levels return to previous levels, which is uncertain.\n\nWATCH: Michael Kratsios, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, comments on plans for location tracking for chips.Bloomberg: The Asia Trade”.\n\nNvidia raked in $4.6 billion of revenue from the H20 in the fiscal quarter ended April 27 — days after new restrictions on shipping the AI accelerator to China were imposed.\n\nIt also said it had been unable to ship $2.5 billion of H20 China revenue in that period because of the new rules. That implies it would have got more than $7 billion in H20 sales to China during the period. If it can return to that level, the US government will stand to get about a billion dollars a quarter from its deal.\n\nAMD could generate $3 billion to $5 billion of 2025 revenue if restrictions were lifted, Morgan Stanley estimates. Chinese alternatives such as Huawei’s Ascend chips now account for 20% to 30% of domestic demand, it reckoned.\n\n“The US government clearly needs the money given its deficits and eagerness to collect tariffs,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. “But the complication is China’s accusations about H20 chips containing back doors, which could be a negotiation tactic to highlight that the country is not ‘hard up’ for US chips.”\n\nFor its part, Nvidia emphasized that its H20 chip is “not a military product or for government infrastructure.” China has “ample supply of domestic chips,” the company said in an emailed statement. “It won’t and never has relied on Americans chips for government operations, just like the US government would not rely on chips from China.”\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu, Emily Forgash, Winnie Hsu, Jessica Sui, Wendy Benjaminson, Kevin Whitelaw, Shadab Nazmi and Yasufumi Saito.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:22:04.117086+00:00"}

This meeting may have higher stakes than many others.

If he is forced out, it could throw the company further into turmoil at an extremely sensitive time.\n\nThe meeting gave investors hope that this outcome could be avoided. Furthermore, it presents the possibility that Tan might abandon his plans to scrap Intel's next-generation semiconductor manufacturing; the Trump administration places a high value on domestic manufacturing, especially in the very sensitive semiconductor industry. However, at this point, any thoughts on what this meeting might lead to are pure conjecture.\n\nIntel continues to struggle, and its path to relevance in the uber-crucial AI maket is unclear.

Or has he, or has been handled by the president, I guess you could say, um with his various meetings in Washington and sort of trying to finesse things in NVIDIA's direction.\n\n00:35 Bill\n\nWell, he's been very astute at working with President Trump. He's made these concessions. Uh he very very much wants to do more business in China. Intel in the past has done exactly the same thing. Uh I think if they're not giving their latest and greatest technology to the Chinese, it may be okay. I'm very wary about giving American technology to China where we're in a big race, particularly AI technology. But uh I think it's, we'll see. My big concern is this is going to spread not just to semiconductor, it's going to spread to other industries. Will we see in pharma where there's a a pay to play so to speak that the US administration will be taking a share of that because the technology research was done in the US. And I I would be very very concerned about that. We seem to be developing much more of a mercantilist approach to our companies and and walking right up if not crossing over the line to separation between government and free enterprise. That's my biggest concern, Julie.\n\n02:43 Speaker A\n\nAnd Bill, you know, even if Terry is right that this this particular type of structure of deal is a one-off, to your point, we have seen a whole host of different flavors of that mercantilist approach that you're talking about. What in your view are the risks of that approach?\n\n03:22 Bill\n\nWell, that we don't have a line between government and capitalism, as you see in many other countries. And I think that's a big concern. How far do you go? The president just advocated not directed the firing of Intel CEO with no evidence that he uh, yes, he has connections in China. So does Tim Cook, so does Elon Musk. But that should not be a prima fascia evidence for firing him. So I see the the CEO of Intel is hustling into the White House today to try to make peace with the president. But how far will this go? That's my concern and how much direction will there be to private industry about how to run this company? We have the golden share of Nippon Steel. And so the president's clearly taking an investment if you will, on behalf of the government in in a lot of industries. And I'm concerned, you know, we're just at the start of this administration. How far is that going to go? And we'll see. And also, the commitments being made, huge. I mean, like Apple, $100 billion on top of $500 billion. Uh enormous in four years. A lot of that won't play out till the end of the administration, but I think these tariffs, no, I think is going to take effect much sooner.\n\n05:28 Speaker A\n\nAnd and Terry, you know, sort of what we hear Bill describing there. What are the implications for investors, both in the case of AMD and NVIDIA, but also just sort of the the way that companies need to approach this administration in the future? From an investment perspective, what do people need to think about?\n\n06:03 Terry\n\nWell, take this NVIDIA AMD story with the 15%. Put it to, put it to the side for one second. What you've got though, is a situation where there is much more government direction and aspiration to direct the economy than there was before. The administration has been crystal clear about that. And as a matter of, as a matter of United States policy, as a matter of national security policy. One of Belsen's mantras has been for months that US National Security Policy is United States economic policy. Economic policy is national security policy. You have a situation here where they're doing everything they can, including providing huge incentives to the the manufacturing industry to onshore, to put to use tariffs in part to push different industries to onshore critical materials and and goods and the like. They've done everything short of invoking the Defense Production Act, which would essentially harness industry to government aims. Why are they doing that? Because they're, they are urgent about the nature of the Chinese challenge and how relatively speaking, how little time they think they have to write the ship. Uh and frankly, harness industry to to right size the economy to meet the Chinese challenge. That's what they think. They've been very transparent about that. And I would I would imagine that would continue and frankly, accelerate. Markets continue to be surprised every time they see something happen, like the United States taking an investment in rare earths. But you you can expect a lot more of it.

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nIntel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 32 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock dropped 3.1% on the news that the U.S. jobs report for July came in significantly weaker than expected while new widespread import tariffs were announced, sparking fears of a potential economic slowdown. The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs, far below estimates, and massive downward revisions to the prior two months painted a much weaker picture of the labor market. This has stoked recession fears, which would directly impact demand for chips used in countless products. Compounding these worries, the White House announced new tariffs, including a 20% levy on imports from Taiwan, a global hub for chip manufacturing. This dual shock of slowing domestic growth and renewed trade friction creates a challenging outlook for the highly cyclical and globally connected semiconductor industry, leading to a broad-based sell-off.\n\nIntel is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $21.12 per share, it is still trading 22.9% below its 52-week high of $27.39 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $438.16.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

What do you make of this agreement? Obviously, it is very unusual here for any other administration, maybe not as much for this administration, but how does this sort of, you know, move things forward, uh, both for these companies and for China negotiations?\n\n00:26 Terry Haines\n\nUh, good morning, Julie, and a, a couple of things. One, I'm not sure it does for, uh, prac, for a very practical reason, which is, uh, you know, the Secretary Luck Nick was talking, talking a few weeks ago about, uh, that this was, the chips for, uh, rare earths was going to be some sort of a balanced deal that would work out. Uh, well, we still haven't worked out the rare earths part of this, so I'm not sure that the chip, uh, the chip things is ever going to get done. Secondly, I think you've, you've, you're seeing on a broader scale here, tech humbled, right? It's, uh, uh, Trump apparently, uh, the last criteria here is a 15%, uh, payment out the door, uh, on the one hand, uh, a strategy which I think would probably depress exports if it was, uh, administered more widely. And on the other hand, the Chinese are saying, uh, apparently that they don't want the chip after all, because they're afraid of back doors, which puts the tech industry in a position of having to show that there's no back doors and in the bargain, where they might put back doors. So, uh, you know, you've got a situation here where this isn't really good for tech, uh, no matter how it, how it slices. Uh, finally, I think the Trump people probably end up with this is a one off. Uh, there's going to be a lot of negative backwash here and, but based on the concerns that, uh, that this sort of strategy might spread beyond this particular deal.\n\n02:22 Julie Hyman\n\nWell, and, and Terry, I just want to follow up and, and ask about the national security concerns also that, you know, the folks who are sort of China hawks had expressed all along that there were reasons to not allow these chips to go into China and getting some money from them doesn't really erase those concerns.\n\n02:54 Terry Haines\n\nNo, it doesn't. Uh, I will tell you the, uh, I, I think that's an entirely legitimate question to ask. I think the tie breaker here is, I'll give it to Secretary, Treasury Secretary Besson, uh, who said originally that this was something that the Chinese wanted. This was part of a broader mosaic of issues that the United States and China were working on. Uh, so, you know, they reluctantly decided to give away what Luck Nick called the third or fourth best chip, uh, in order, so they bent national security a little bit. Uh, they think they didn't break it, uh, but they are taking a piece out the door here, which, uh, certainly doesn't pass a smell test.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:22:16.498930+00:00"}

Now, as we know, uh, Nvidia already made a different version of its chips in order to try to get access to China. Reportedly, it was going to get the okay for those export licenses, but now the reports are coming that it had to agree to pay this first.\n\n00:25 Dan\n\nYeah, it's it's a rather interesting uh, agreement uh, if if it all comes uh, kind of together the way it's it's been reported at this point that 15% of the revenue that they would get from China sales going to uh, the the administration basically. Uh, I mean, obviously, anything that assures that Nvidia and AMD will be able to sell into China, people will take. Um, you know, these are uh, some of their most important uh, countries that they or one of the most important countries that they sell into. Uh, you know, obviously, when when there was the ban in place, investors kind of were down at first, and then they were kind of saying, okay, well, you know, now that that revenue is removed, it's it's no longer a guessing game as to what kind of revenue the the company's going to be bringing in. We we just know it's going to be what what it's going to be. But now, uh, with China kind of back in play and then seemingly this ensuring that they'll be able to sell chips, you can imagine that that investors will be happier about that. Uh, but you have to wonder how much in the end, uh, the companies will end up having to turn over just to make sure that they get to sell the chips, period.\n\n02:12 Speaker A\n\nYeah, I I just want to mention as well that we did get a statement from Nvidia about all of this, and they didn't directly confirm the reports. What they said was, we follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. We while we haven't shipped H200 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide. America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America's AI tech stack can be the world standard if we race. And this has been sort of reportedly the position of Jensen Wong, the the case that he made to the president that the US needed to stay in China in order to stay competitive.

But Dan, I do want to follow up and ask you about what's going on with Intel and its CEO, Lipu Tan, who is reportedly going to be meeting with Trump today on a very different issue.\n\n03:28 Dan\n\nYeah, this is basically Trump trying to oust him. Uh, he said that he had to leave the company uh, that he was, you know, quote-unquote very conflicted. And this kind of goes back to his days with cadence. Uh, cadence just settled a uh suit with the government basically saying that they had provided some materials to a university that the government believes has links to the Chinese military. And so, you know, they settled, uh, and then Senator Tom Cotton had come forward and said, look, you know, this is this is a big deal. Uh, someone should, you know, look deeper into this. Uh, Lipu Tan has some investments in Chinese companies. Uh, he is a US citizen.

So, well, it looks like Wall Street's bull run looks set to continue. Remember last week, the Nasdaq hit two consecutive record highs while the S&P 500 narrowly missed its own record high on Friday. Big tech was firmly in focus last week with Apple posting its best week since 2020. And our first thing you need to know before that opening bell rings is again focused on tech. In what can only be described as an unusual agreement, Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay 15% of their China chip sale revenue to the US government. Why? Well, it's seen as one way the firms can secure export licenses from the Trump administration that were granted last week. Shares of both were down in the pre-market as you can see here. Now, Nvidia will give a share of its revenues from the sale of its H20 chip sales in China, while AMD will do the same for the sale of its MI308 chips. The arrangement reflects US President Donald Trump's consistent effort to engineer a financial payout for America in return for concessions on trade. His administration has shown a willingness to relax trade conditions like tariffs in return for giant investments in the US. Beijing, which has grown increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese firms deploying the H20 is unlikely to warm to the idea of a chip tax. Well, we're staying with chips for the next thing you need to know before that opening bell rings. Intel CEO, Lip Butan, is set to meet US President Donald Trump at the White House later today. They're going to be discussing cooperation between Intel and the US government. The Intel boss's personal and professional experience is also likely to come under the spotlight. Remember last week, the president called for Tan to resign amid suspicions of a conflict of interest. And remember, Trump ally, Tom Cotton, sent a letter to the Intel CEO questioning Tan's investments in Chinese companies. And the final thing you need to know before the opening bell rings is that Chinese electric battery maker, manufacturing firm, CATL has suspended production at one of its lithium mines in China. The move came after its mining license expired on Saturday. This sent the price of lithium futures soaring in China as well as stocks related to met, the metal needed to run electric cars.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:22:28.352560+00:00"}

The products also use AI technology to improve the user interface, making it easy to use and simple to understand. The AI reads and responds in real text, based on natural language models; in practice, Palantir’s users don’t need to learn machine language or computer coding to communicate with the AI – they can simply enter their requests in clear text and receive responses the same way. The technology is also amenable to real-time translations, making Palantir’s products easy to market internationally – the system just needs to be told what language it is using, and its translation algorithms handle the rest.\n\nThe first AI stock we’ll look at here is one of the leaders in the field. Palantir is well-known for marrying AI technology and capabilities to the field of data analysis, a match that has matured into a solid product platform – AIP, or AI Platform – and a set of tools whose wide applicability has made them highly popular. Since its founding in 2003, Palantir has developed a reputation for innovation, and has built itself into a $441 billion giant of the AI industry.\n\nWith numbers like these, it’s no surprise that UBS analysts are combing through the sector to pinpoint the most promising AI stocks. Their latest deep dive zeroes in on two recent earnings reporters – Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) – to see which is the superior AI stock to buy. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nThis equals big money for the AI developers out there. Chip makers, AI app creators, data analysis firms – all of these and more have created an industry that was valued at $233 billion last year, and is estimated by Fortune Business Insights to hit $294 billion this year – and to show a CAGR of 29.2% through 2032, reaching $1.77 trillion that year. We should note that North American AI companies, mainly in the US, are leading this industry, with a 2024 market share of nearly 33%.\n\nTake advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off! Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\n\nThe AI boom is nearly 3 years old, and one thing is certain about it: the boom has legs, and AI is here to stay. More and more companies are turning to the technology to enhance all sorts of functions, from customer service to chatbots to high-level data analytics and even to decision-making processes. According to Fortune Business Insights, up to 35% of all businesses have integrated AI into their work models.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company’s products and capabilities have proven particularly popular in government use, especially in the Department of Defense. This is clear from the company’s frequent announcements of new projects; DoD contracts and partnerships are regularly featured. Two examples: in July, Palantir announced that it had entered into a joint program, Warp Speed for Warships, with BlueForge Alliance, to accelerate warship production, fleet readiness, and digital transformation for the US Navy. And in June, the company launched a strategic partnership with Accenture, for the deployment of commercial-grade, AI-powered solutions designed to meet the high-priority operational challenges across a wide range of Federal agencies.\n\nIn its last quarterly report, covering 2Q25, the company announced a series of strong gains in key metrics. The company’s customer count was up 43% year-over-year, providing a base that supported a 48% YoY jump in revenue, to $1.004 billion – marking Palantir’s first billion-dollar quarter and beating the forecast by $60.5 million. At the bottom line, Palantir realized non-GAAP earnings of 16 cents per share, 2 cents per share better than had been expected. The company’s quarterly adjusted free cash flow came to $569 million, which represented a margin of 57%. And the company finished the quarter with cash and liquid assets totaling $6 billion.\n\nAbout the only thing that has grown faster than Palantir’s financial markers was the company’s share price. Year-to-date, shares in Palantir have far outpaced the broader markets. PLTR trades on the NASDAQ, which is up 11% so far this year, and it is a component of the S&P 500 index, which is up 9%; at the same time, for the year-to-date, PLTR has gained an impressive 147%. For the past three years, the stock’s gain is over 1,849%.\n\nCovering Palantir for UBS, 5-star analyst Karl Keirstead notes the company’s strong performance, yet he finds it impossible to ignore its high valuation. He writes, “Palantir reported its 8th straight quarter of revs growth acceleration, a turnaround that we’ve never seen before, from 13% growth in 2Q23 to a 2Q25 growth rate of 48%, while at a $4 billion revs scale. Palantir raised the full year 2025 total growth guidance to 45% from 36%, without compromising on the non-GAAP margin target, which was inched up to 46%. Palantir is benefiting from a confluence of mega-trends in AI application development, investments at the data layer and the modernization of defense tech, but valuation at 136x CY26E FCF remains our key hurdle…”\n\nThat hurdle leads Keirstead to rate PLTR as Neutral (i.e., Hold). His price target on the stock is $165, implying a one-year downside of ~12%. (To watch Keirstead’s track record, click here)\n\nThe Street generally would seem to agree with the UBS view. PLTR has a Hold consensus rating, based on 19 recent analyst reviews that include 4 to Buy, 13 to Hold, and 2 to Sell. The shares are priced at $186.96 and have an average price target of $152.12, suggesting that the share price will fall by ~19% in the next 12 months. (See PLTR stock forecast)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nNext up on the AI stage is AMD, a fast-rising contender steadily climbing the semiconductor ranks with a solid growth streak. It may not yet belong to the trillion-dollar club alongside Nvidia, Broadcom, and TSMC, but with a market cap near $280 billion, AMD is far from a lightweight. Over the past four quarters, it has pulled in roughly $30 billion in revenue, powered by a diverse portfolio spanning PCs, gaming rigs, and the surging AI/data-center market. Here, AMD isn’t merely keeping pace – it’s going toe-to-toe with Nvidia in AI accelerators and challenging Intel in PC microprocessors.\n\nThat competitive edge has been sharpened in recent years as AMD shifted from its roots in PCs and gaming toward a bigger slice of the AI pie. The company now offers a broad lineup of AI solutions across CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing, with the flexibility to tailor products for specific customer needs – whether in data centers, at the edge, or in enterprise applications. This diversification isn’t just theoretical; it’s showing up in high-profile wins and an expanding product pipeline.\n\nIn June, AMD landed Nokia as a customer for its 5th generation EPYC processors, which will power the Nokia Cloud Platform – a deal that underscores the broad applicability of its technology. Just a month earlier, AMD unveiled new high-performance computing products, including the Radeon RX 9060 XT and Radeon AI PRO R9700 graphics cards, plus the Ryzen Threadripper 9000 Series processors, targeting growth in gaming, content creation, and AI workloads.\n\nIn 2Q25, AMD reported gains in both AI-related and gaming sales, with AI/data center sales climbing 14% YoY to $3.2 billion and gaming revenue surging 73% to $1.1 billion. Client revenue hit a record $2.5 billion, up 67% vs. the previous year, helping overall revenue climb 32% to $7.685 billion, thereby beating the estimates by $260 million. Non-GAAP EPS came in at 48 cents, in line with expectations, while cash on hand totaled $4.44 billion. For Q3, AMD anticipates revenue of ~$8.7 billion, with a possible variation of $300 million, compared to the $8.32 billion consensus estimate.\n\nThat performance has caught the eye of UBS’s Timothy Arcuri, an analyst who ranks in 6th spot amongst the thousands of Street stock experts, who sees reasons for both caution and optimism.\n\n“AMD beat (on revenue) and guided above, but only to about where investor expectations were into the print. The bear would say that the beat was largely gaming-driven and while data center GPU is seeing a strong inflection in 2H, this was already baked into expectations and AMD did not raise the full year outlook for data center GPU despite all of the hyperscaler capex increases. In the very near-term, this may carry the day, but we think the path of travel for the business – and ultimately the stock – remains in a positive direction.”\n\nLaying out a supporting case for buying in, the 5-star analyst goes on to say, “First, excluding China, AMD’s data center GPU business is growing at a rate roughly similar to NVDA in C2H:25… Second, the outlook for market share growth in both the server and desktop portion of the CPU business is very strong with INTC’s roadmap under duress – combined, these are ~35% of AMD’s revenue and accretive to margins. Third, we would like to see gross margin inflecting quicker, but the underlying trends are still up and to the right with AMD able to at least hold GM flat even in CQ3 where the mix is unfavorable.”\n\nThat conviction earned AMD a Buy rating from Arcuri, who set a $210 price target – pointing to a potential 21.5% gain over the next year. (To watch Arcuri’s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, AMD boasts a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 37 analyst reviews that break down to 25 Buys and 12 Holds. The stock’s current trading price of $172.76 is slightly below the $180.78 average target price, implying a modest one-year upside of ~5%.

He drove 17 initiatives across the organization through four so-called pillars of getting everyone aligned around confronting reality, driving efficiency, setting clear targets and “normalizing intensity” to get things done.\n\n“Underperforming companies stop talking about performing,” he told me. “They stop communicating because it looks ugly. You need to tell them what your vision is to make this a great company … It’s not restructuring I’m after. Transformation is a lot more holistic and ambitious.”\n\nAnd his response to tariffs, geopolitical challenges and ever-shifting technologies is to focus on making Rolls-Royce more proactive and agile. “You can’t always influence the macro stuff but you influence how you deal with it,” says Erginbilgiç, who created a large task force that reports to him every two weeks.\n\nWhen trying to align 50,000 people around transformation, his advice is not to obsess over the latest AI or budget target. “Nobody gets excited about budgets,” he says. “Tell people what good looks like.”\n\nContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:22:34.221784+00:00"}

U.S. customers like Nvidia, Apple, Google, etc needs and should understand they NEED a second source for their lead product manufacturing due to pricing, geographic stability and supply line security reasons.\n\n4. Intel is cash poor and can’t afford to invest in the capacity needed in the future to replace TSMC or even a reasonable fraction of TSMC capacity. They probably need a cash infusion of $40B or so to be competitive. Realistically that investment is 100% of the Chip Act Capital grants so unlikely the USG is the savior.\n\n5. The only place the cash can come from is the customers. They are all cash rich and if 8 of them were willing to invest $5B each then Intel would have a chance.\n\n6. The current Intel CEO’s comments about not investing in new technology (14A) until customers sign up is a joke. To win in this space you need to be the leader in technology not the follower. It takes multiple years to create one of these technologies and no customer wants to sign up for something that is second best.\n\n7. Fortunately Intel has good technology to work with (high NA EUV, backside power, etc) so they have a realistic shot at leadership IF THEY INVEST NOW. They just need the money.\n\n8. Where does the money come from? The customers invest for a piece of Intel and guaranteed supply. Why should they invest? Domestic supply, second source, national security, leverage in negotiating with TSMC, etc. AND IF THE USG GETS ITS ACT TOGETHER, they catalyze the action with a 50% (or whatever number Trump picks) tariff on state of the art semi imports.

The FFWBMs (four former wise board members) of Intel continue to claim you have to break Intel into two pieces before any customer will invest in Intel. Be serious. There are many company interactions that involve both supply and competition. It is also extremely hard to imagine Intel really competing with the likes of Nvidia, Apple, Meta, Google, Dell, etc in their well established product lines. By all means, if you want to complicate the problem, then take the time to split up Intel and make the FFWBMs happy but if you’re in the business of saving Intel and its core manufacturing strength for the USA then solve the real problem – immediate investment in Intel, committed customers, national security, etc.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:22:37.906823+00:00"}

The company understood the opportunity and was supplying chips for the highly popular BlackBerry phone. The chips were designed by Arm, a British firm that designs chips but doesn’t manufacture them. Intel understandably preferred to make phone chips with its own architecture, known as x86. The company decided to stop making Arm chips and to create an x86 chip for cell phones—in retrospect, “a major strategic error,” says Yoffie. “The plan was that we would have a competitive product within a year, and we ended up not having a competitive product within a decade,” he recalls. “It wasn’t that we missed it. It was that we screwed it up.”\n\nIts decline began some 20 years ago, when the company made multiple acquisitions, many of which were in telecommunications and wireless technology. In concept, that made great sense. But acquiring businesses is a skill of its own, and David Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor who was on Intel’s board of directors at the time, told Fortune: “100% of those acquisitions failed. We spent $12 billion, and the return was zero or negative.”\n\nIt would have been a one-day story if it weren’t about Intel, once the world’s biggest, most advanced maker of computer chips.\n\nThe drama began on the morning of Aug. 7, when President Trump posted a short statement on Truth Social: “The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” The post suddenly directed attention to a letter Sen. Tom Cotton (R.-Ark.) had sent to Intel’s board chairman two days earlier. It said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies,” and a multinational company had recently pleaded guilty to violating U.S. export controls “under Mr. Tan’s tenure,” among other accusations. By day’s end, Tan had sent a letter to Intel employees saying, “There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles … I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,” and Intel had told the media, “We look forward to our continued engagement with the administration.” The stock fell 5% on an up day for the market, another blow to Intel shareholders who had hoped—finally—that things might have hit bottom.\n\nWe’re about to find out in a bizarre case that could alter not just the career of a CEO but also a onetime corporate jewel of American enterprise, a global industry, and what a previous commerce secretary has called “the most important piece of hardware in the 21 st century.”\n\nWhat happens when a U.S. president tries to take down the CEO of a publicly traded company?\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs years went by, simple poor management crept in. Intel kept missing new-chip deadlines and lost market share. The company gave up on smartphone chips. CEOs were replaced, but the production troubles continued until, by 2021, for the first time in Intel’s existence, its chips were two generations behind competitors’. Those competitors were Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung.\n\nIn crisis mode, Intel’s board brought back Pat Gelsinger, an engineer who had spent 30 years at Intel before leaving for 11 years to be a high-level executive at EMC and then CEO of VMware. As Intel’s CEO he announced an extraordinarily ambitious and expensive plan to reclaim the company’s stature as the world leader in chip technology. In February of this year, as the stock price fell, the board fired him and brought in Tan.\n\nDespite it all, Intel is still crucially important because it’s the only U.S. company with the technology and know-how to make leading-edge chips in America—though it hasn’t actually done that in eight years. At the highest level of geopolitics, primacy in chips is central to power, and for the past eight years the world’s fastest, most valuable chips have been made only in Taiwan and South Korea. That’s why Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act with bipartisan majorities. It became law in 2022 and starting last year has sent billions of dollars to chipmakers, American and foreign, building new factories and other chip infrastructure in the U.S. Intel was allotted the most subsidies, about $8 billion plus loans, though the company hasn’t received most of the money, which is disbursed based on reaching project milestones.\n\nIt’s as if the money came just a little too late. “Intel had a great opportunity,” says Gaurav Gupta, an analyst at the Gartner research firm. “They were getting all these subsidies from the government. But I think they just could not execute.” At that critical moment, poor performance was costly. “A year and a half ago there was still positivity with Intel,” says Alvin Nguyen, an analyst at the Forrester research firm. “Now, not as much. The negativity that’s hit them, it’s just snowballed.”\n\nNow suppose Tan were to step down as CEO. “Who wants that job?” asks Stacy Rasgon, a longtime tech analyst at Bernstein. He observes in a recent note that Tan “doesn’t ‘need’ to run Intel (he’s very wealthy and has a lot of other things to occupy his time) … He clearly wants to do what is best for Intel.” But it’s unclear if resigning would be good or bad for the company, “especially with Trump’s crosshairs on his back.” Rasgon, speaking to Fortune, asks, “How do you attract somebody else into that spot?”\n\nGetting Tan wasn’t easy. “The board took a while in finding the new CEO when [previous boss] Pat Gelsinger left,” says Gupta. “It took a long time to find a candidate willing to take control and lead the company in a direction.”\n\nNonetheless, Yoffie and three other former Intel directors argued in a statement to Fortune for a new company, a new board, and a new CEO, spinning off Intel’s manufacturing arm into an independent company to secure America’s chipmaking dominance.\n\nTrump’s post puts himself at the center of a crucial conundrum for national security. Global dominance requires a reliable source of leading-edge chips. That’s why Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in 2024 said they’re “the most important piece of hardware.” The world’s largest producer of leading-edge chips by far, Taiwan’s TSMC, is building two fabs in Arizona, subsidized by the CHIPS Act, with more planned. “You can make the argument that the more capacity builds in Arizona, maybe the less we need Intel,” says Rasgon. But TSMC isn’t an American firm, and Nguyen says, “The best technology from TSMC is definitely not coming to the U.S. at this time.”\n\nWhich leaves Intel. “They’re the only American company that can do it,” says Rasgon. “But Intel still has to prove they could deliver. They haven’t proven that.” Trump has shone a spotlight on the once-iconic company. But identifying problems and solving them are two very different matters, something Intel-watchers have known for going on two decades.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:22:43.473078+00:00"}

They argued that only a dramatic break could restore Intel’s competitiveness and protect U.S. national security interests, with a rescue plan focused specifically on emancipating Intel’s “Foundry” business, the manufacturing assets in which Intel produces semiconductor chips for its own products and for third-party customers.

Both are essential for computing, but only the Foundry is key to national security, which has been a key point in trade talks between Trump and Xi. The group of former directors argued that splitting the chips manufacturing entity from the rest of Intel would directly address both market competitiveness and the nation’s strategic need for advanced semiconductors.\n\nThe group called for Intel shareholders to insist on the split, which would create a new, independent manufacturing entity, with its own CEO and board. To make the new company competitive with TSMC, the former directors called for remaining funds under the CHIPS Act to go toward supporting the company and to help “persuade American design firms to place orders.” That would position the new company as an alternative to TSMC, “both for cutting-edge chips needed for data-center and other commercial purposes and for national security requirements.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:22:56.405946+00:00"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nChipmakers and industry associations are showing mixed support for President Donald Trump’s proposed 100% tariffs on semiconductor imports.\n\nDuring a press event at the Oval Office with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Trump said Wednesday that “there will be no charge” for companies that are doing business or building capacity in the United States. He also warned companies will be charged if they lie about their plans.\n\n“You have to pay. And that’s a guarantee,” Trump said, adding later, “I think the chip companies are all coming back home.”\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association, a D.C.-based trade and lobbying group, expressed support for the 100% tariff on chip imports, saying it looks forward to learning more about the exemption details.\n\n“Trade is critical to American semiconductor leadership. And so we hope the tariff exemptions and future trade deals are designed to ensure the U.S. semiconductor industry retains its pole position in the race to be the most globally competitive,” SIA President and CEO John Neuffer said in a statement Thursday.\n\n“We are eager to learn more about the President’s plan for semiconductor tariffs, including the scope and structure of exemptions for companies manufacturing in the U.S.,” Neuffer added.\n\nThe effort builds on the president’s America First agenda to grow domestic manufacturing, in part by pressuring companies to reorient their supply chains and operations via increased tariffs. In recent months, Trump has negotiated with a number of world leaders for exemptions to his country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs, which went into effect Aug. 7. In addition to chips, Trump has also threatened 250% tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.\n\nGlobalFoundries, a New York-based chipmaker with manufacturing in Germany and Singapore, is “monitoring the situation closely,” a spokesperson said. However, the company provided no comment as there is no official policy proposal published yet.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, did not respond to a request for comment. The company has been in Trump’s good graces after pledging to invest $100 billion in March to expand its U.S. manufacturing capacity. It completed construction of a second fabrication plant in Phoenix this year, and broke ground on a third fab in April. TSMC produces chips for several U.S. companies, including Apple, AMD and Nvidia, with plans to ramp up additional capacity over the next five years.\n\nNvidia, which contracts out its Blackwell chip designs for production at TSMC’s Phoenix location, declined to comment.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Reuters reported that Dan Lachica, president of the Semiconductor and Electronics Industries in the Philippines, said Trump's plan would be \"devastating\" for his country.\n\nIn Malaysia, a global leader in chip testing and packaging, trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz warned parliament his country “will risk losing a major market in the United States if its products become less competitive as a result of the imposition of these tariffs,” Reuters also reported.\n\nTrump calls for resignation of Intel’s CEO\n\nMeanwhile, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who has been on a cost-cutting spree since taking over in March, recently came under fire from Trump over his qualifications to lead one of the largest U.S. semiconductor companies.\n\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump posted Thursday morning on his social media platform Truth Social. “There is no solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”\n\nUnder the leadership of Tan, a former executive at chip software maker Cadence Design Systems, Intel has stated plans to reduce its global workforce by 25%, exit multiple international construction projects and decelerate its ongoing chip fab project in New Albany, Ohio. The CEO has also recently faced criticism for certain alleged ties to China.\n\nArkansas Sen. Tom Cotton raised national security concerns in a letter dated Aug. 5, saying Tan “controls dozens of Chinese companies” and has stakes in hundreds of China-based advanced manufacturing and chip firms.\n\nHe also said Tan oversaw his former company Cadence during a period of “illegal activity.” Last week, Cadence pleaded guilty to selling its software to a restricted military university in China. It agreed to pay a fine of $140 million.\n\nIn a memo to employees, Tan addressed Trump’s comments and allegations, saying “there has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles.” Despite these pressures, Intel is on board with his America First agenda.\n\n“We are engaging with the Administration to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts,” Tan said. “I fully share the President’s commitment to advancing U.S. national and economic security, I appreciate his leadership to advance these priorities, and I’m proud to lead a company that is so central to these goals.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:23:09.225345+00:00"}

The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has gained 12.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nIntel is expected to post earnings of $0.01 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +102.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.4%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.15 points to a change of +215.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -28.7%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.68 indicates a change of +353.3% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:23:11.125720+00:00"}

In fact, they hit a record high after a report that the US had imposed tariffs on imports of 1 kilogram bars. Earlier this morning, the price climbed above $3,354. It scaled back slightly since then. Interestingly, the price spread between New York and New York futures and spot prices widened by more than $100 after the Financial Times reported the news. It's worth noting that Switzerland is the world's largest gold refining hub, and remember, Swiss exports into the US already face a 39% levy. Overall, US stock futures are looking positive after a pretty mixed session yesterday. Markets actually trimmed earlier losses following President Trump's nomination of Stephen Miron, the current chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve on the Fed board. He'll take over from Fed governor Adriana Kugler following her surprise resignation last week. The speculation over who will replace the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, is certainly intensifying. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller is emerging as a top candidate, according to Bloomberg News. But former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, who has also expressed support for cutting interest rates, is still in contention. Moving on to our next thing you need to know before the bell rings now, and the CEO of Intel has hit back after President Trump called for his resignation. Lip Butan responded late Thursday, calling reports about his career misinformation. In a letter to staff, he said the company was engaging with the Trump administration. Now, Tan was named Intel CEO back in March, taking over from Pat Gelsingers tumultuous tenure that saw the company's stock plummet and the chipmaker fall behind in the AI race. Investors cheered Tan's appointment with the stock rising as much as 15% after the news, and Wall Street analysts, as well as current and former executives and employees, saw Tan as the best possibility to succeed in turning around the troubled company. Now, Trump's call for Tan's resignation came a day after one of his top Senate allies, Republican Tom Cotton, wrote a letter to Intel's board chair questioning Tan's China ties.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:23:19.774356+00:00"}

More specifically, POTUS’s call for resignation followed a Fox Business segment on Cotton’s letter to Yeary by mere minutes.\n\nCotton’s letter also pointed out that from 2009 to 2021, Tan served as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which just last week agreed to plead guilty to a conspiracy charge and pay the US government $140 million to settle claims it sold chip design hardware and software to a Chinese military university between 2015 and 2021.\n\nWhile we’d say an out-of-the-blue political firestorm isn’t ideal — after all, it’s not every day that a sitting US president calls for the resignation of a major private corporation — Intel has been an economic piñata for roughly the past decade:\n\nIn fact, earlier this week, Reuters reported that Intel is struggling to perfect its so-called “18A” high-end chip manufacturing process, pitched as a key step to closing the technology gap with industry frontrunner TSMC and a way to score new clients.\n\nThe setback comes just after the company warned in its most recent earnings call in July that it could abandon the advanced chipmaking space altogether if it can’t attract major new customers. Meanwhile, its planned chipmaking plant in Ohio — funded in part by more than $8 billion in federal grants — continues to face delays.\n\nGood POTUS, Bad POTUS: Meena Bose, executive dean for public policy and public service programs at Hofstra University, told The Wall Street Journal that the White House insisting that a CEO resign is “at the very least unusual, if not unprecedented.” (The Obama administration ousted GM’s then-CEO Rick Wagoner during auto industry bailouts in 2009, and the George W. Bush administration forced out then-AIG chief Robert Willumstad during the financial crisis.)

OpenAI’s GPT-5 is live and free! You can read all about Sam Altman’s latest LLM model and what this does to its competition with Google and Meta here. How will it impact all the entrepreneurs and business leaders who are building business models around these ever-changing technologies? The answer may be, “not much.”\n\nI spoke with serial entrepreneur Geoff Nudd yesterday, whose startup Anonymous Health deploys AI to help people overcome addiction and unwanted habits. Launched in June, it now serves more than 10,000 users. While Nudd is pleased to have access to more intelligence, he likens the update to the “heyday of semiconductors, where you always want to be planning for what’s going to be out there in 18 months.”\n\nNudd argues there are five main components to delivering value: the LLM, the context, the prompt, the workflow and the evaluation. “It’s those five things working together in concert that really create magic,” he says. “The frontier models are effectively commoditized. How you create value goes back to those other four components.”\n\n“Folks like us will go to whatever is cheapest at some point, because they’re all basically the same,” he added. “If I have the system of record for the industry, plus touch points into other systems, then I have the broadest possible context.”\n\nHis advice: Seek breadth in your systems, go deep in understanding your customer and deploy new capabilities with purpose. Nudd’s model, for example, uses AI to engage users at times of high risk for addictive behavior.

Thank you for your attention to this problem!”\n\nTrump made the post after Senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary, expressing concern over CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s investments and ties to semiconductor firms that are reportedly linked to the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army. Cotton asked the board whether Tan had divested his interests in these companies to eliminate any conflicts of interest.\n\nIt's not immediately clear if Tan, who took over as Intel's CEO in March, has done so.\n\nIn a statement, Intel said it was “deeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests\". The firm said it was making \"significant investments aligned with the President’s America First agenda\".\n\nCotton's allegations\n\n“In March 2025, Intel appointed Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO,\" Cotton wrote in the letter. \"Mr. Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”\n\nCotton specifically called out Tan’s recent leadership of Cadence Design Systems in the letter. According to the US Department of Justice, Cadence, agreed in July to plead guilty to resolve charges that it violated export controls rules to sell hardware and software to China’s National University of Defense Technology, which is linked to the Chinese military.\n\nTan was the CEO of Cadence when the company violated the rules between 2015 and 2021.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security also fined Cadence $95 million for the same breaches, saying Cadence admitted that “employees of its Chinese subsidiary knowingly transferred sensitive US technology to entities that develop supercomputers in support of China’s military modernisation and nuclear weapons programs.”\n\nCadence did not immediately respond to AP requests.\n\nThe digital race\n\nTan previously launched the venture capital firm Walden International in 1987 to focus on funding tech start-ups, including chip makers.\n\nChina’s state media has described Tan as “actively” devoted to Chinese and Asian markets, having invested not only in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, but also China’s state-owned enterprise SMIC, which seeks to advance China’s chipmaking capabilities.\n\nThe demands made by Trump and Cotton come as economic and political rivalries between the US and China increasingly focus on the competition over chips, AI and other digital technologies that experts say will shape future economies and military conflicts.\n\nCotton, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has raised concerns that Chinese spies could be working at tech companies and defence contractors, using their positions to steal secrets or plant digital backdoors that give China access to classified systems and networks.\n\nOn Thursday the Arkansas Republican wrote to the Department of Defense, urging Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ban all non-US citizens from jobs allowing them to access DoD networks. He has also demanded an investigation into Chinese citizens working for defence contractors.\n\n“The US government recognises that China’s cyber capabilities pose one of the most aggressive and dangerous threats to the United States, as evidenced by infiltration of our critical infrastructure, telecommunications networks, and supply chains,” Cotton wrote in an earlier letter, calling on the Pentagon to conduct the investigation.\n\nNational security officials have linked China’s government to hacking campaigns targeting prominent Americans and critical US systems.\n\n“US companies who receive government grants should be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and adhere to strict security regulations,” Cotton wrote on the social platform X.\n\nPlaying catch-up\n\nIntel had been a beneficiary of the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act, receiving more than $8 billion (€6.9bn) in federal funding to build computer chip plants around the country.\n\nShares of the California company slid 3.5%, while markets, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq, gained ground.\n\nFounded in 1968 at the start of the PC revolution, Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple’s 2007 release of the iPhone, and it has lagged behind more nimble chipmakers. Intel’s troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence — a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech’s hottest commodity.\n\nIntel is shedding thousands of workers and cutting expenses, including some domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, as Tan tries to revive the fortunes of the struggling chipmaker.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:23:38.851964+00:00"}

The Tokyo Electron arrest raises questions about why its employee would be involved in such an endeavor, whether it would have any motivation to steal TSMC trade secrets and whether the case ties into Japan’s own ambitions to build a domestic chip industry.\n\n“The fact that Tokyo Electron has come under the spotlight in this way feels like an unfortunate accident,” said Atsushi Osanai, a professor at Waseda University.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, in team meetings around the organization, Tokyo Electron employees were instructed to refrain from talking about the matter, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named describing private information.

It will be exempt from tariffs because it is building new chip factories in Arizona.\n\nU.S.-based chipmakers helped by the news include GlobalFoundries (GFS) and Texas Instruments (TXN).\n\n\"100% tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States,\" Trump said. \"But if you've made a commitment to build (in the U.S.) or if you're in the process of building (in the U.S.), there is no tariff. … If you say you've committed but don't build, we'll add up the charges.\"\n\nTrump made his comments on the Section 232 semiconductor tariffs at an event late Wednesday at the White House. At that event, consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL) announced an additional $100 billion commitment to U.S. manufacturing. All told, Apple has pledged to invest $600 billion in U.S. operations over the next four years.\n\nIn its official announcement, Apple called out manufacturing partners Amkor Technology (AMKR), Applied Materials (AMAT), Broadcom (AVGO), Coherent (COHR), Corning (GLW), GlobalFoundries, Samsung, Texas Instruments, TSMC and others.\n\nChip Stocks Get A Bump\n\nThe Philadelphia semiconductor index, known as SOX, rose 1.5% on Thursday. The SOX includes the 30 largest semiconductor stocks traded in the U.S., such as AMD (AMD), Broadcom and Nvidia (NVDA). Year to date, the SOX index is up 13.1%.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) advanced 1.7% on Thursday. The exchange traded fund aims to match the performance of the NYSE Semiconductor Index.\n\nTrump's chip tariff comments are \"a relief\" for semiconductor firms, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a client note. Plus, reshoring chip manufacturing to the U.S. would provide a tailwind to makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, he said.\n\nIntel Stock Falls On CEO Criticism\n\nOne chip stock falling on Thursday was Intel (INTC).\n\nIn a Truth Social post, President Trump urged Intel's chief executive, Lip-Bu Tan, to resign, calling him \"highly conflicted.\"\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Tan's ties to Chinese companies in a letter to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary. He noted that Tan, the former CEO at Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), had invested in Chinese semiconductor companies and others with connections to the country's military.\n\n\"Intel and Mr. Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the U.S. defense ecosystem,\" the company said in a statement to Bloomberg. Intel said it would address the matters in the letter with the senator. The company appointed Tan as CEO in March.\n\nOn Thursday, Intel stock sank 3.1% to close at 19.77.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Tan's connections to Chinese companies were well known before he took the Intel job. In a client note, he said Tan is \"a legend in the semi industry.\"\n\nTan took the Intel job because he has \"a deep-seated passion for Intel and a desire to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon,\" Rasgon said. \"He clearly wants to do what is best for Intel, and we suppose now he will have to ask himself whether or not resigning would best for them, especially with Trump's crosshairs on his back.\"\n\nSome analysts have speculated that TSMC or Broadcom could take over all or parts of Intel.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nSharkNinja Jumps On Strong Q2 Earnings, Raised Guidance\n\nSymbotic Stock Falls As Warehouse Automation Firm Misses With Outlook\n\nApple Stock: Time To Buy Or Sell?

Back then, the heads of General Motors and AIG were pushed out.\n\nIntel's chipmaking business has struggled, but Trump didn't mention those concerns in his demand.\n\nTrump's post came shortly after Sen. Tom Cotton claimed in a letter to Intel's chairman that Tan \"controls dozens of Chinese companies.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday demanded the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. It's exceedingly rare for a U.S. president to call for the resignation of a private company's leader—but it has happened before.\n\nThe last time was during the Great Recession in 2009, when a newly elected Barack Obama urged General Motors (GM) CEO Rick Wagoner to step down amid auto industry bailout negotiations. GM and Chrysler were asking for billions of dollars in government loans, and a White House task force pressed Wagoner to step aside as a condition of GM receiving additional relief.\n\nGeorge W. Bush faced similar circumstances in the waning months of his presidency, after the federal government bought a nearly 80% stake in AIG as part of an $85 billion bailout of the financial services giant. Henry Paulson, Bush’s treasury secretary, reportedly insisted that CEO Robert Willumstad be removed.\n\nWhat Makes Trump Different?\n\nWhile Intel’s chipmaking business has faced well-documented struggles, Trump's criticism isn't tied to financial performance. Instead, in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, Trump accused Tan of having a conflict of interest.\n\n\"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social network. \"There is no other solution to this problem.\"\n\nThe post likely references a letter sent by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary this week, in which Cotton wrote, \"Mr. Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.\"\n\nTan is the former CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), which settled legal proceedings with the U.S. government last month relating to \"operations and business dealings in China\" during his time at the helm.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:23:59.156165+00:00"}

There is no other solution to this problem.”\n\nTrump's comments came a day after Republican Sen. Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel's board chair with questions about Tan's ties to Chinese firms and a recent criminal case involving his former firm Cadence Design. The Arkansas lawmaker cited Reuters' exclusive reporting in April of Tan's investments, some of which were made via venture firm or holding companies, of at least $200 million in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms, some linked to the Chinese military.\n\nCotton said in the letter he has concerns about the \"security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security\" related to Tan's reported investments. Ohio Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno joined in on the calls questioning the CEO, posting on X Aug. 7 that it is \"pretty obvious\" that Intel failed its commitments to the state and that Ohio should start a fraud investigation. Intel has invested billions into building microchip factories in the state.\n\nUSA TODAY has not received an immediate response for a request for comment from Intel or Tan.\n\nIntel's stock price slipped by more than 3% by early afternoon Thursday, Aug. 7, in wake of the lawmakers' calls earlier that day.\n\nMore: Exemption in Trump's chip tariff helps US stocks open higher\n\nChip manufacturing has become a key sticking point for the Republican president since taking office in January, singling out the industry in his effort to bolster U.S. manufacturing. During a White House event Wednesday, Aug. 6, Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on foreign semiconductors in an effort to ground supply chains in the U.S.\n\nTan took the top job at the struggling company in March, replacing two interim co-CEOs after the ousting of Pat Gelsinger in December 2024. Tan, a Malaysian-born Chinese American, is a semiconductor-industry veteran who once served as CEO of Cadence Design Systems from 2009 to 2021. The company agreed to plead guilty in July over charges it committed criminal violations of export controls, after it sold products to a Chinese military university believed to be involved in simulating nuclear explosions. Tan was CEO during the time of these sales, Reuters reports.\n\nSome analysts and investors said Tan's deep knowledge of the Chinese semiconductor landscape is a strategic asset. Others see the political pressure as a sign of growing uncertainty around Intel.\n\nIntel was once the globe's leading chipmaker. But the company has struggled to regain its foothold in recent years, as its server chip business took a hit amid a rush of spending and interest on AI chips, a sector that Intel's competitor Nvidia currently dominates.\n\nA change in leadership at Intel could pile pressure on the company, which is also a pillar of U.S. efforts to boost domestic chipmaking. Last year it secured $8 billion in subsidies from former President Joe Biden's administration, the largest under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 2%, while Micron (MU) stocks edged up 0.7%.\n\nMost of the world's advanced chips are produced by leading contract chip manufacturer TSMC (TSM) in Taiwan, but the company has been building out its capacity in Arizona with a $165 billion investment, exempting it from Trump's tariffs. The company's US-listed shares jumped nearly 5% Thursday.\n\nTech companies have rushed to announce investments in their US manufacturing footprint in the hopes of avoiding Trump’s trade war wrath. So far, Nvidia has committed to producing $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the US. Micron made a similar $200 billion commitment. Texas Instruments (TXN) has said it’s spending $60 billion to bolster its manufacturing capacity in the US.\n\nCiti analyst Christopher Danely said the exemptions mean the semiconductor tariff will have “minimal impact … as US-based semiconductor companies with in-house fabs have operations in the US and fabless companies can commit to using TSMC, Samsung, GFS which have operations in the US.”\n\n“Fabs” refer to factories where chips are produced, and “fabless” companies outsource production of their chips to contract manufacturers such as TSMC, Samsung (005930.KS), and GFS (GFS). Companies with in-house fabs include Intel (INTC), Micron, and Texas Instruments. Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Qualcomm (QCOM) are fabless.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) analyst Joseph Moore echoed Danely's sentiment, writing in a note to clients Thursday, “To some degree this outcome would be something of a relief.”\n\n“Yes, 100% tariffs are unpalatable but if companies are given time to restore them, the real tax is just the higher cost of building chips in the United States,\" he wrote. \"The biggest fear was that such a tariff would be implemented immediately.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:24:18.630207+00:00"}

Tan was named CEO of Intel in March.\n\nIntel shares were down more than 3% in mid-morning trading Thursday after Donald Trump called on social media for the company’s CEO to “resign, immediately.”\n\nLip-Bu Tan was named CEO of Intel in March, replacing Pat Gelsinger. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has questioned Tan’s ties to Chinese companies in recent days and has raised concerns about a criminal case at Cadence Design, where Tan served as CEO until 2021 in a letter sent to the company’s chairman Wesnesday.\n\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!,” he wrote.\n\nIntel did not immediately respond to Fortune‘s request for comment about Trump’s demand.\n\nReuters has reported Tan has invested at least $200 million in a number of Chinese companies, including some linked to the country’s military. That has led to previous criticism of him from the investment world.\n\n“The simple fact is that Mr. Tan is unqualified to serve as the head of any company competing against China, let alone one with actual intelligence and national security ramifications like Intel and its tremendous legacy connection to all areas of America’s intelligence and the defense ecosystem,” Bastille Ventures partner Andrew King told Reuters.\n\nHe was also CEO of Cadence during a period when the company unlawfully exported semiconductor design tools to a People’s Republic of China military university. (Cadence pleaded guilty to those charges and paid a $140 million fine last month.)\n\nTan’s appointment as CEO at Intel was initially cheered by investors. Shares jumped 10% on the news earlier this year and he was seen as eminently qualified and was the first outsider to ever be named a leader at the company. He has overseen plans to cut 25,000 jobs this year, but the company did surpass analyst expectations in its most recent earnings.\n\nTrump inserting himself into the affairs of leading a non-governmental company is unique, but not without precedent.

Tom Cotton to the Intel chairman, demanding answers about Tan’s ties to China.\n\n“The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” Trump wrote Thursday morning.\n\nTan only took the helm at Intel in March 2025, and his appointment was initially welcomed by investors, with Intel’s stock rising as much as 15% following his start. Tan took over from Pat Gelsinger, long considered a star CEO in the chips and semiconductor space, who was reportedly forced out by the board, which had grown frustrated with Intel losing market share to Nvidia.\n\nBy late July, Tan sent a memo to employees informing them of significant ongoing layoffs and other cost-cutting measures, and shares were trading below their springtime level by that point. On Thursday, shares fell as much as 3% in premarket trading after Trump’s post.\n\nWhy Trump thinks Tan could be ‘conflicted’\n\nThe conflict centers on Tan’s financial and professional ties to Chinese companies, particularly those with links to China’s military and technology sector. According to a Reuters investigation in April, Tan—either directly or via his venture funds—has invested at least $200 million in at least 20 Chinese advanced manufacturing and semiconductor firms between 2012 and 2024. The probe identified several companies with links to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.\n\nThese revelations gained new urgency after Sen. Cotton sent an open letter to Intel’s board, also reported by Reuters, questioning Tan’s allegiances and whether the company could be trusted with nearly $8 billion in federal subsidies under the CHIPS and Science Act—money designed to shore up domestic chip fabrication critical to U.S. security, finalized during the Biden administration.\n\nCotton’s letter demanded to know whether Intel had required Tan to divest any interests in Chinese technology companies or firms tied to China’s Communist Party and its armed forces. The senator referenced not just Tan’s investments, but also his leadership of Cadence Design Systems, a major chip design company. Less than two weeks before Cotton’s letter was issued, in late July, Cadence admitted to violating export rules by providing technology to a Chinese military university and agreed to pay a $140 million fine as a result.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:24:28.964592+00:00"}

Obviously, Tan is just still green as far as being Intel's CEO. And so, this kind of shake-up would, I mean, I can't imagine what it would do to the company at this point. They're they're right now trying to figure out what they would, uh, what to do post, uh, Pat Gelsinger. They were trying to figure out what to do with the foundry business. Uh, obviously, Intel sticking behind Tan for now. Uh, but yeah, the Tom Cotton letter, basically asking about Tan's prior investments in Chinese chip companies, as well as the Cadence settlement that they had completed when he was the CEO over there. And so, you know, there's there's concerns seemingly from the politicians, I guess Republicans, being Tom Cotton and the president, um, but I don't know if this means that we'll actually see Tan step down. I think it also though brings into question the kind of government subsidies that the company has gotten, right? Like will they continue to be able to receive those? Uh, will they not? Will Trump pull back on those? Will there be any issues beyond that? So, I think those are big concerns right now and it's still unknown.\n\n02:34 Speaker B\n\nYeah, most definitely. And as you mentioned, the backdrop for this company is company is already really troubled, right? You know, Lip Bu Tan hasn't been the CEO for very long. Pat Gelsinger was the CEO. And there have been a lot of questions about his strategy to make Intel more of a foundry, more of a manufacturer of chips for other companies. That was a strategy that didn't seem to catch on. Um, Tan coming in here trying to sort of put his imprint on the company, Dan. And so, this feels like just yet another hit to a company that's already struggling.\n\n03:38 Speaker A\n\nYeah, I mean, look, there's there's no doubt, and look, Tan has said it himself that they're wildly behind in AI. They have to catch up. They're they're trying to figure out what to do with that foundry business. It's still, I mean, the main customer is still Intel, right? And they say that it'll take a while for them to start getting third-party partners. There's been questions about whether or not the chip technology that they're using, Athena, will actually be used for third-party customers. They kind of put those questions to bed during the most recent earnings call. You know, there's then questions about whether or not there's delays. There's been different reports about that with 18A. And you know, what what that means then for 14A, the coming technology. So, they're really under the gun obviously. They're they're nowhere near the likes of Nvidia or AMD when it comes to AI. They they won't be for quite some time until they can come up with an AI chip that's capable of competing.

The government still expects economic growth in 2025 to reach the level of 3.1%, despite the impact of the new levies, Liu said.\n\nTSMC manufactures the most advanced chips used in artificial intelligence, and the island’s technology exports drove growth to a blistering 7.96% in the second quarter, the fastest pace in four years. The trillion-dollar company accounts for almost 40% of the weight of Taiwan’s benchmark stock index, and its rally Thursday helped lift the broader benchmark.\n\nTSMC’s shares rose 4.89% to a record NT$1,180 Thursday, helping the island’s benchmark stock index outperform regional peers with a 2.4% gain. The Taiwan dollar also rallied as much as 0.9% against the greenback.\n\nUnited Microelectronics Corp., Taiwan’s second-largest chipmaker, may also reduce the impact of tariffs through its cooperation with Intel Corp., Liu said.\n\n“Investors had been apprehensive while awaiting the tariff rate for semiconductors, but exemptions for Taiwan’s largest company have allayed concerns,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. “Foreign equity inflows on the back of this news have helped pushed TWD stronger. With the dividend repatriation flows now largely complete, and with the USD back under pressure again, we could see further appreciation in TWD near-term.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, but cited Apple Inc. as an example of a company that won’t have to pay levies because of its investment in the US.\n\n“If you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge,” Trump said. “Even though you’re building and you’re not producing yet.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:24:54.443031+00:00"}

Here's when it may open Intel, the financially embattled chipmaker, has delayed the opening of its first Ohio factory to 2030 or 2031, multiple years after it was to open.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel's board chair on Aug. 6 with questions about the chipmaker's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan's ties to Chinese firms and a recent criminal case involving his former company Cadence Design.\n\nWriting to \"express concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security\", Cotton asked in the letter to Intel chairperson Frank Yeary whether the company's board was aware of the subpoenas sent to Cadence during Tan's time there as CEO before Intel hired him. Cotton asked what measures were taken to address those concerns.\n\nHe also asked whether Intel's board required Tan to divest from chip firms in China linked to the Chinese military or Communist Party, and if Tan adequately disclosed other ties to Chinese companies due to Intel's involvement in the Secure Enclave program, an initiative designed under the Biden administration to ensure a secure supply of microelectronics for defense.\n\nIntel received billions from the federal government to expand its production capabilities, including a $28 billion project underway in the Licking County portion of New Albany. That project has been beset by delays, pushing its completion back into the next decade.\n\nBecause of Intel getting federal funding under the initiative, Cotton questioned Yeary in the letter about Tan's disclosures related to investment, professional roles or other ties to Chinese companies.\n\n\"Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\" Cotton wrote. \"Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.\"\n\nIn a statement, an Intel spokesperson said, \"Intel and Mr. Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the U.S. defense ecosystem.\" The company said it would address the matters in the letter with the Senator.\n\nIn April, Reuters reported Tan - himself or through venture funds he has founded or operates - has invested in hundreds of Chinese companies, some of which are linked to the Chinese military. The Intel CEO invested at least $200 million in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms between March 2012 and December 2024, Reuters found.\n\nA source familiar with the matter had at the time told Reuters that Tan had divested from his positions in entities in China, without providing further details. Chinese databases reviewed by Reuters at the time had listed many of his investments as current, and Reuters was at the time unable to establish the extent of his divestitures.\n\nCotton's letter mentioned the Reuters story as a source.\n\nIt is not illegal for U.S. citizens to hold stakes in Chinese companies, even those with ties to the Chinese military, unless those companies have been added to the U.S. Treasury's Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List, which explicitly bans such investments. Reuters in April had found no evidence that Tan at the time was invested directly in any company on the U.S. Treasury's list.\n\nSeparately, last week Cadence Design agreed to plead guilty and pay more than $140 million to resolve charges for selling its chip design products to a Chinese military university, Reuters reported. The institution was believed to be involved in simulating nuclear blasts.\n\nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cadence said it was \"pleased\" to reach settlements with the Justice and Commerce departments.\n\nTan ran Cadence as CEO from 2008 through 2021 and was executive chairman until May 2023. The sales to Chinese entities occurred under his leadership at Cadence, which makes design software and other tools used to create chips.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

You are listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nWelcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Tim Beyers, your host. With me today, Jose Najarro who is one of our expert semiconductor and chip analysts. Jose, how are you feeling today? What do you think of the Intel news? We had Intel earnings. We had a release. I'm not sure it was such a great release, Jose, but what did you make of it?\n\nJose Najarro: Intel earnings were crazy, Tim. I think this is going to be the quarter that two or three years from now we see as the complete shift point of determining if Intel turned the ship around or did not. I believe this is that crucial quarter that is going to be looked back as the moment it all happened.\n\nTim Beyers: Look, this is super interesting. I'm quoting from the release now, Intel will no longer move forward with planned projects in Germany and Poland. The company also intends to consolidate its assembly and test operations in Costa Rica into its larger sites in Vietnam and Malaysia. In addition, Intel will further slow the pace of construction in Ohio. Just everything it is like a big stop sign is on display at Intel headquarters here. What do you expect in terms of sharpening spend for Intel? What is Lip-Bu Tan really after here?\n\nJose Najarro: First, and to put those into numbers, future construction was expected to be around $50 billion. Now, with all those delays and all those haltings, some were delayed, some were pushed back, like you mentioned, that 50 billion dropped down to 35 billion. Just a massive $15 billion in reduction on future construction. Now, Lip-Bu Tan, I think he mentioned it pretty well. The same day as earnings release, he actually had employee letter sent out to his team, which you can actually also find on the investor presentation website. I think he shared it with the community as well. The main concept, Tim, that was going is prior management seemed to have an open check on building all these different fabs and buying all these different equipment because they expected demand to eventually pick up. Lip-Bu Tan is like, I want to do it a little bit different. I'm only going to approve checks or approve these investments if we have the demand lined up. It makes perfect sense. Maybe prior management just got a little bit too excited about themselves and the future of it. Lip-Bu Tan still wants to continue with this market, but he wants to do it at what I consider a smart way of expansion.\n\nTim Beyers: Well, he's certainly being more cautious, isn't he? A couple of other stats for you here, $1.9 billion in restructuring charges, and this was just in Q2, and 800 million of non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation. I thought this was really telling, Jose. Talking about being smart and moving in the direction, one of the things he seems to be doing is getting rid of the stuff that was not working. These charges, particularly that accelerated depreciation, are apparently for excess tools with no identified reuse. That is brutal, meaning we wasted $800 million out the door. Add to that, the cash burn for the first two quarters of this year, is about six billion dollars, and that's before you account for 1.35 billion in stock-based compensation over that period. The cutbacks, the reframing, what do you think this says about the durability of Intel for the long-term?\n\nJose Najarro: I think Lip-Bu Tan is trying. Obviously, I think when you start off as a CEO, you have the opportunity to do the massive restart button or touch that button right off the bat, because I guess that's your main job at starting off. That's what he did. He definitely hit the restart button pretty hard. He even talked a little bit about the target workforce. Intel, typically, for the past 5, 6, 7 years, Tim, has had over 100,000 employees. He wants to drop that down to 75,000 by the end of this year. That alone completely reshapes Intel.\n\nTim Beyers: It's a big cut.\n\nJose Najarro: Now, with those restructuring costs, the great thing is, there might be a little bit of light within there, is what he's doing is there was a lot of older equipment that still had, in theory, plenty of life available to itself if they had the demand. They had purchased a lot of new equipment for some other A18, A14. What he wants to do is, look, even though this older equipment, in theory, still has life available to it, let's push that old equipment out and we got to use this new equipment instead because we bought it. We got it new. It has better yield rates. Now we have to write off that older equipment that still had its life to it because we don't have the demand for it. The restructuring definitely was painful, but at least it was more on older equipment, opposed to equipment that just got bought a year or two ago.\n\nTim Beyers: Fair enough. This restructuring is going to be ongoing. You mentioned there, 18A and 14A. These are the newest and smallest form factor manufacturing platforms for chips, and this is where they're going to build their most advanced AI chips, for example. Make a prediction for me, Jose. You're looking ahead, big investments in Intel Foundry, trying to streamline, trying to restructure. In what year do you think Intel Foundry, as a functional part of this business, is going to turn profitable? When do you think it's going to happen?\n\nJose Najarro: Let's see. I think this is how I would say my optimistic timeline would be. Right now, Intel is releasing 18A for internal usage, and it's going to stay for internal usage. The actual chips won't come out until later this year. The consumer and everybody is not going to see how strong 18A is until 2026. 2026 is going to be that era or that time when we validate, at least Intel as a strong manufacturing player. Then that will potentially give customers a reason to try out maybe 14A in the future, but that takes some time. If I was to get some form of profitability, it would definitely be, well, 2028, maybe even 2029. It's definitely going to be at the end of this. If it happens, it's most likely to happen at the end of this decade, not within the next two years or so.\n\nTim Beyers: I'm going to go 2030. We're going to take a quick break here. Up next, is now the right time to be investing in the semiconductor industry?\n\nShivani Pau: We've grown up surrounded by beauty ideals that promised confidence but often delivered shame. In a special episode of A Millennial Mind, I sat down with Nicola Adams to explore how appearance-based compliments and body talk shape our self-worth without us realizing it. In partnership with the Dove Self-Esteem Project, we unpack the tools to change the conversation for ourselves and for future generations. Listen now and download the free body confidence journal at dove.com/y2k.\n\nTim Beyers: We're back. I'm here with Jose Najarro, and we are talking about semiconductors. We just talked about the Intel earnings, Jose, and lots of things to improve there. They have a lot of restructuring underway, a lot to do, and not a very long time to do it. But there were other earnings. We had earnings from ASML, and despite the top and bottom line expectations beating on both those counts, the company now says the tariffs have made forecasting impossible for the moment. How concerned are you about that? Didn't we just get a deal with the EU over the weekend?\n\nJose Najarro: Hopefully, the deal with the EU helps improve the commentary from leadership from ASML. I think with ASML, looking at it in the whole semiconductor market, is maybe not the best approach, because ASML at the end of the day, only really has a handful of big customers, Tim, it has the only ones. For those that are not familiar, ASML makes these important critical machines that are used for the manufacturing of semiconductors. Only manufacturers go out there and buy ASML machines. Those are your TSMCs, your Intels, like we just talked about in the prior segment, and your Samsung. Those are usually the top three giants. If any of them see any hiccup in maybe, I don't need to build a new supply chain line right now, you're going to see those bookings, those revenue really fluctuate. As we heard from Intel, they're slowing down on CapEx. That definitely can be seen as a negative take for ASML. Now, on the other hand, we did have some great earnings from TSMC, which prompt that they are going to increase capital expenditure. I think for ASML, the long-term thesis is still pretty much intact.\n\nBy 2030, they still believe that they can expect somewhere between €44-60 billion by fiscal year. I think most recently last 12 months is about 32 billion. There's still a nice growth opportunity. I think that's still in place. I think right now it's just the short-term of how manufacturers are going to look at this consumer demand for semiconductors. I think we might see a bit of a hiccup this year, maybe even next year, but I think the long-term tailwind for long-term investors is still pretty much in the good side of ASML.\n\nTim Beyers: Do yourself a favor, Fools. If you want to get a sense of what ASML makes, go look up a short video or get a picture of one of these big EUV machines. They are giant. They look like they belong in a supervillain's layer. They are enormous. But you did mention Taiwan Semiconductor. Net revenue was up 44% year-over-year, and that missed expectations. What the heck is going on here? This is my other question for you, Jose. Are the expectations baked into semiconductor stocks too high at this moment?\n\nJose Najarro: First, let's talk about that expectations baked thing. I think for AI semiconductor companies, the answer is yes. We've seen a lot of great sentiments on AMD, on NVIDIA, and some of these other players. I think on other segments, there are semiconductor players in the automotive space, in the analog, in the industrial robotics, industrial markets. All those are still pretty weak, so there's not much expectations there. Another one, there's not much expectations in, Tim, are the equipment players. We saw it from ASML. There's not much expectations right now in the short-term for those companies, but I do believe those sectors in the long-term, have a good opportunity, even though the short-term automotive, we don't know when that market will pick up, but I do believe we're going to get smarter vehicles. We're going to need more vehicles, electrified vehicles, a little bit autonomous vehicles in the next five years. Growth opportunities for a lot of markets. I think the one that's running hot and might have too much expectations would be more the AI chip market.\n\nTim Beyers: I think that's fair. We have some data from the Semiconductor Industry Association, just to take this a little further. They said that annual global sales across all semiconductors are on track to grow 11.2% in 2025 and global sales in 2026 are going to grow 8.5%. A little bit of deceleration there. Is that at all surprising to you or is this just part of the cycle? Because this has historically been a cyclical business.\n\nJose Najarro: I think it's part of the cycle, Tim. We still have uncertainties of how consumers are going to be doing with bending with any random events that might come with tariffs or which are outside job market or anything. I do believe maybe a lot of these short-term expectations are somewhat a little bit conservative or cautious to make sure they try to account some of those random events that could occur that could bring some of the consumer market down. In the long-term, I think by 2030, we still have a lot of firms believing that the semiconductor market will hit a trillion dollars. For 2030, trillion dollars, how we get there in the short-term might be a little bit wonky, but as you're seeing more demand for AI, eventually, we're going to have AI products entering the consumer space. You need more chips on your phone, more chips on if we have augmented AI glasses, autonomous vehicles, and the list goes on. So many products that you can start to add AI to, and we're already seeing that in place. When is the consumer going to pick that up? I don't know, but definitely before 2030.\n\nTim Beyers: Next, we're going to do a bit of trivia, and then we're going to do a ranking of some of the best semiconductor stocks across the value chain. Up next, a little trivia about the semiconductor value chain, and we're going to rank some stocks in that value chain.\n\nJose, as I tend to do on these shows, we like to have a little trivia, something to educate, as well as maybe inform and get a little laughs from time to time. But this one, I think is going to be interesting. Fools, if you don't know this, the semiconductor value chain is pretty extensive. It's also global. Jose, here and Fools get in your answers. Let us know what you think in comments to this podcast. Can you name all the links in the semiconductor industry value chain, and my hint to you, which you probably don't need, but there are seven. This is from Gemini Advanced. It gave me seven links in the semiconductor value chain. What do you got for me?\n\nJose Najarro: Hopefully, I get this right, Tim, and hopefully Gemini didn't hallucinate with us here. But for me, let me just say, I would think the first when I think of semiconductors is your materials. Your silicon, your gold, copper, whatever is needed to make that semiconductor product. Those materials needed for the manufacturing process.\n\nTim Beyers: There you got one. I'll count them off as you get them.\n\nJose Najarro: Then after that is, what do you do with those materials? You make the products. But how can you make the products? The equipment? Your companies like ASML. The manufacturers of the equipment needed to make the semiconductors. Be it your ASML, your Lam Research. But overall, the equipment needed for manufacturing.\n\nTim Beyers: You're going to have to break up those manufacturing pieces. I'll give you a hint there, but I'll say that's two. Keep going.\n\nJose Najarro: We'll break that up, maybe in a bit. Then Number 3 would be who uses those equipment? It'll be the manufacturers themselves. It'd be your TSMC, your Intel, your Samsung, your advanced packaging players, your OSATs. That would be my Number 3 is materials, equipment makers.\n\nTim Beyers: You got that one.\n\nJose Najarro: Manufacturers. Then after that is, what are these players manufacturing, and how are they getting these designs? For me, the next would be that software, your EDA solutions, the way you build those blueprints. That'll be your Cadence, your Synopsys.\n\nTim Beyers: There's another. You got four.\n\nJose Najarro: Then after that is who's actually designing this? It'd be your fabless, your designers in theory, your NVIDIAs, your AMDs, everybody else. That would be the next on the list.\n\nTim Beyers: That's five.\n\nJose Najarro: The next thing is, once you have a semiconductor product, you still need to make the end good. Your OEMs or your ODMs who end up making the PCs, who end up making the AI servers, who end up making the phones with the semiconductor products. It would be however that gets built. Then after that, I would have to guess is the end user, either being maybe your consumer who buys the product or your Cloud server providers who are buying these servers to make the Cloud in space.\n\nTim Beyers: That's a fair argument, but it's not on the list.\n\nJose Najarro: No.\n\nTim Beyers: But I think you credibly got six there. I'll give you the list, and this is the order it goes in. EDA, electronic design automation. You got that one. Chip design, fabless companies. You got that one. Raw materials and equipment. That was the first thing you said. That's right. I told you they broke out some of the equipment manufacturing. The next one they had is wafer fabrication. You mentioned Lam Research. Wafers and then assembly packaging and testing. Again, breaking it out. But then you mentioned directly integrated device manufacturers. You mentioned them. Absolutely right. Then distribution and OEMs. I think you mostly nailed it there, but I want you to rank. Since we just talked about the value chain, let's rank a few companies on that value chain. I've got six for you. If you can give me a 1-6 and then we'll close things out here. I've got Cadence in EDA. Equipment, ASML, fabless design, NVIDIA, also Micron, similar, but in memory. Wafer manufacturing, Lam, because you mentioned them earlier. Then at the foundry level, we have distribution and manufacturing at scale, Taiwan Semi. Those six, Cadence, ASML, NVIDIA, Micron, Lam Research. In terms of ability to outperform over the next five years, give me your 1-6 ranking.\n\nJose Najarro: Obviously, I'm going to be looking at today's prices, and that's going to play a good role into this. I would say, Number 1 for me would be ASML, Tim. It's weird. The reason being is, I think the market is not expecting a lot from them, but I think the overall long-term tailwind is there.\n\nTim Beyers: Fair enough.\n\nJose Najarro: Number 2, I'm going to go with NVIDIA. I think while NVIDIA is probably the most expensive, four trillion dollar, I put it in two because I do believe the AI market is going to grow from here. We're still in early innings. We're just in the search and some research of it, but AI is going to do more than that. Number 3, I'm going to go back to a semiconductor equipment. I do like Lam Research. Lam Research has a little bit more unique play in the memory market. I do believe the memory market has a nice growth story ahead. It doesn't matter if NVIDIA is the winner or who is the winner. Lam Research provides equipment to build a lot of these HBM solutions. Number 3 would be Lam Research. Number 4, I think I would put Micron. I think Micron, while it is normally a little bit more risky play because of the cyclicality within the business. I think right now HBM, as long as they continue, and that's important. As long as they continue to innovate, I think Micron has a nice future from here. Number 5, I'm going to put TSM. The world can't run without TSM right now. We see Intel doesn't have the demand. Samsung is not doing too well either. TSMC continues to see nice strong growth.\n\nTim Beyers: They are the heavy.\n\nJose Najarro: While it is crucial, Number 6, I'm going to go with Cadence. I think Cadence is extremely important. I just do think valuations in some of these software EDA plays has maybe a little bit balloon that maybe don't make me too confident on market opportunities right now. But luckily, the market always gives us opportunities. If we had a better price point, Cadence would definitely be a little bit higher than it is in the list right now.\n\nTim Beyers: There you go. We have ASML, NVIDIA. Give it to me one more time. ASML NVIDIA, you put Micron fourth.\n\nJose Najarro: Lam Research.\n\nTim Beyers: Lam, Micron.\n\nJose Najarro: TSM.\n\nTim Beyers: Taiwan Semi.\n\nJose Najarro: Cadence.\n\nTim Beyers: Then Cadence. Great. Thanks for that, Jose.\n\nFools, advertisements are sponsored content and provided for informational purposes only.

With Intel’s likely retreat from advanced chip manufacturing, America’s future and the future of its leadership in AI and all advanced electronics will be firmly in the hands of two firms: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) and Samsung , two firms headquartered on the other side of the planet. TSMC is by far the dominant player, controlling over 90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing output. The Taiwanese chip manufacturer produces nearly 100% of Nvidia’s GPUs, which are the engines that enable AI. It also manufactures most of the chips for iPhones and 5G communications.\n\nAll of these announcements strongly imply a gradual exit from the chip manufacturing business, turning Intel into a fabless company over time. Given that Intel’s internal demand is no longer big enough to justify continued capital investment in leading-edge technology, this may be the right strategy for Intel.\n\nIntel appears to have only a few external customers for its current technology (called 18A), and the CEO recently said on July 24 that “Going forward, our investment in … [Intel’s most advanced process technology, 14A will] be based on confirmed customer commitments,” continuing a business model that has largely failed. Unsurprisingly, the CEO also announced the shuttering of its plans for German and Polish plants, further delaying its proposed Ohio plant, and a massive lay-off. More spending reductions will inevitably follow.\n\nU.S. advanced semiconductor manufacturing has been withering for some time. The once-leading Intel appears to be dropping out of the race. Missed deadlines, poor execution, and a misguided strategy to retain manufacturing within Intel while also serving as a foundry for its fabless chip competitors resulted in a dearth of customers. Recommendations (including those from the four of us) to split off Intel’s foundry business and create a fully independent entity to supply its competitors, thereby giving itself a fighting chance, have never been adopted.\n\nA little over five years ago, the Trump administration announced Operation Warp Speed to deliver a vaccine for COVID-19. It was one of the most stunning successes of Trump’s first term. Recognizing a crisis, the U.S. government facilitated a public-private partnership that likely saved millions of lives in record time. Now we must do it again. As a country, we have a strategic imperative to win in artificial intelligence and secure our supply chains for critical technologies, including communications, computing, and advanced military systems. Time is of the essence. Yet the Administration’s plans for AI and self-sufficiency are in serious jeopardy unless we have American-owned, leading-edge chip manufacturing plants on American soil.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile TSMC and Samsung have committed to building more plants in the U.S., these will not solve the problem. Neither company will bring its latest technology here. The newest generation of chips must first be developed in a plant geographically close to its R&D teams. In the case of TSMC, those teams are in Taiwan; for Samsung, South Korea. The only R&D team that has been developing advanced generation technologies on US soil, fabricated in the latest generation U.S.-owned plants, is Intel. But as Intel retreats, America’s future in AI and other advanced technologies is increasingly reliant on a single firm, located a stone’s throw from mainland China.\n\nTo be sure, TSMC’s technological prowess is impressive. Moreover, its promise to invest $100 billion in Arizona is laudable. However, the fact is that we are giving TSMC too much power over the allocation of capacity, pricing, and human capital to drive AI into the future. In the case of Taiwan, business risk is compounded by the obvious geopolitical risks attendant to its status. These dependencies are intolerable if the U.S. is to protect its own economic and national security interests.\n\nFortunately, the Trump Administration has dealt itself enough cards to rectify this obvious vulnerability. The Administration recognizes that the United States needs advanced chip-making capabilities within our own country. To this end, by executive order March 31, the President created the United States Investment Accelerator at the Department of Commerce. It is responsible, among other things, for administering the CHIPS Program Office. Billions remain unspent from this Congressional program. Perhaps billions more can be retrieved from Intel, given its apparent surrender in the race with TSMC. In addition to these billions, the Trump Administration on July 22 also wrested from Japan a commitment to invest more than $550 billion in the United States.\n\nWith CHIPS money, Japan’s partnership, and government investment —either direct or through Trump’s recent executive order to create a sovereign wealth fund —the federal government has the opportunity to launch “Operation Warp Speed II” and put America back on the leading edge of chip manufacturing. Speed is essential: As Intel downsizes and lays off thousands of people, we are losing and will continue to lose the best people. Soon, we will be without a viable foundation on which to build a new, world-class American foundry, for which Intel’s assets are critical.\n\nHere’s a plan:\n\nFirst, similar to the first Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration should build a public-private partnership, where future customers (e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Google, Amazon, Apple and others), Japanese investors such as Softbank, and private equity, backed by government financing and/or investment, would buy Intel’s fabrication assets before the lack of investment and the rust of time makes them worthless and leave the United States dangerously dependent on a single manufacturing firm.\n\nSecond, the Trump administration has been very effective in persuading leading U.S. companies to invest in America’s future. They should be encouraged to partner and invest in a new American Foundry and to buy from it. Nvidia, Broadcom, Google, and others may have turned down Intel’s offering, but they cannot as easily turn down the opportunity to help create an independent, leading-edge domestic competitor to TSMC. American companies want (and need) alternative sources of supply, and this plan can provide them.\n\nBuilding a new American Foundry for advanced semiconductors is the best strategy to keep the United States and American firms at the leading edge of AI and advanced electronics, and to ensure that critical supply chains are not disrupted by geopolitics, pandemics, or natural disasters.

But what does the future hold for Intel’s stock price? If you’re considering investing in this chip giant or already own shares, you’re probably wondering where the stock is headed. Let's breakdown Intel's 2025, 2026 and 2030 stock predictions.\n\nCurrent Overview of Intel Stock\n\nIntel (INTC) is one of the world's leading semiconductor companies. The stock has been trading around $18 – $21 per share, with a market cap of roughly $99.67 billion. Intel, once the undisputed leader of the chipmaking world, has been facing intense competition from the likes of AMD and Nvidia. With the rise of AI, cloud computing and 5G, these competitors are gaining market share and Intel has had to rethink its strategy.\n\nRecent headlines surrounding Intel focus on its massive investments in chip manufacturing facilities, particularly in the U.S. Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has made it clear they're in for the long haul with plans to reclaim dominance by 2025. While Intel is still a big player in the semiconductor game, the stock has been relatively stagnant due to delays in their chip production road map, which hasn't helped investor confidence.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\n\nDespite all this, Intel's fundamentals remain solid. With an annual revenue of around $53.1 billion in 2024 and a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around -5.01, Intel looks undervalued compared to its competitors. But is now the time to buy? Let's dig into the predictions.\n\nIntel Stock Price Prediction for 2025\n\nCurrently, Intel's stock is trading at $22.85, but analysts aren't overly optimistic about its short-term prospects. While Intel has made large investments in manufacturing to reclaim market share, experts predict that 2025 might be another challenging year. Due to strong competition from AMD and Nvidia and Intel's struggles to innovate quickly enough, forecasts suggest the stock may remain flat or experience modest growth, potentially reaching $22.85 in June.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:25:20.039959+00:00"}

As enterprises scale up generative AI, autonomous vehicles, and data-driven cloud infrastructure, Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become an essential tool across sectors. After a 171% surge in 2024 and another 25% gain so far in 2025, some investors may wonder whether Nvidia is now priced too high for continued upside.\n\nHere, we outline Nvidia's current financial standing and uses a structured forecasting methodology to estimate potential price targets for 2025, 2026 and 2030. We'll explore a blend of analyst sentiment, algorithmic projections and valuation data to frame Nvidia's possible path over the short and long term.\n\nCurrent Overview\n\nAs of July 2025, Nvidia is trading above the $160 level, up more than 25% year-to-date. The company holds a market capitalization of more than $4 trillion, with a trailing P/E ratio around 55.96. The figure is elevated by market standards, but it is lower than its recent historical average, which hovered closer to 68.\n\nNvidia's fundamentals remain strong. Its data center division continues to drive revenue, capitalizing on surging AI demand across big tech, cloud services and emerging enterprise applications. Gross margins remain near 70%, and Nvidia consistently reports earnings surprises above consensus expectations.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\n\nFrom a sentiment perspective, Nvidia is still a favorite among institutional investors and analysts. According to our Analyst Ratings, 43 out of 48 analysts rate NVDA as a Buy or Strong Buy. The average 12-month price target sits around $181.27, with a low target near $100 and a high at $250. Still, concerns about valuation, rising competition from AMD and Intel and regulatory scrutiny around AI infrastructure have some investors questioning how much upside remains.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:25:21.987341+00:00"}

Early reports suggest Panther Lake chips have roughly three times the defect rate they should, and volume ramps are lagging. That's a headache so close to the planned Q4 launch, especially when smooth ramp-up was supposed to prove we're past the worst of manufacturing woes.\n\nStill, investors seem to be looking past the short-term noise. Maybe a rebound in PC and data-center spendingor a clean bill of health at the August 12 bond covenant updatewill do the trick. The real verdict, though, will come with Q3 production progress and any signs that Panther Lake irons out its kinks.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:25:25.625189+00:00"}

Here's when it may open Intel, the financially embattled chipmaker, has delayed the opening of its first Ohio factory to 2030 or 2031, multiple years after it was to open.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The production process that Intel hoped would pave the way to winning manufacturing deals and restore its edge in churning out high-end, high-margin chips is facing a big hurdle on quality as it puts newer technologies to the test, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters.\n\nIntel is in the middle of a $28 billion project to construct two microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany. The project broke ground in 2022 and was originally projected to open this year, but the company's financial struggles among other factors have pushed back that timeline to 2030 or later. Just last month Intel announced unspecified further delays for the project known as Ohio One.\n\nFor months, Intel has promised investors it would increase manufacturing using a process it calls 18A. It spent billions of dollars developing 18A, including the construction or upgrades of several factories, with the goal of challenging Taiwan's chipmaking heavyweight, TSMC. Intel wants to round out its business designing chips that it largely makes in-house and TSMC helps it produce, with a contract manufacturing business that can compete with this key supplier. But whether Intel revives advanced chip production in the U.S. and gets its contract foundry on solid footing depends on closing the technology gap with TSMC.\n\nRelated Intel article: Gov. Mike DeWine responds to news Intel will 'further slow' construction on Ohio factories\n\nEarly tests disappointed customers last year, but Intel has said its 18A is on track to make its \"Panther Lake\" laptop semiconductors at high volume starting in 2025, which include next-generation transistors and a more efficient way to deliver power to the chip. The chipmaker has hoped that producing such an advanced in-house chip would grow external interest in its foundry, at a time when new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has explored a major shift to course-correct that fledgling business, Reuters previously reported.\n\nYet only a small percentage of the Panther Lake chips printed via 18A have been good enough to make available to customers, said the two people, who were briefed on the company's test data since late last year. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because Intel did not authorize them to disclose such information.\n\nThis percentage figure, known as yield, means Intel may struggle to make its high-end laptop chip profitably in the near future.\n\nYield may inch up or down as a foundry optimizes its manufacturing process. Companies also calculate yield in a variety of ways, which can make this critical data a moving goal post, the two people and two additional sources with knowledge of Intel's manufacturing operation said.\n\nYields generally \"start off low and improve over time,\" Intel's Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner told Reuters in a July 24 interview.\n\nFor Panther Lake, \"it's early in the ramp,\" he said. In a statement on July 30, Intel added: \"Our performance and yield trajectory gives us confidence this will be a successful launch that further strengthens Intel’s position in the notebook market.\"\n\nIntel in the past has aimed for a yield north of 50% before ramping production because starting any earlier risked damaging its profit margin, three of the sources said.\n\nIntel typically does not make the lion's share of its profit until yields reach roughly 70% to 80%, key for a chip as small as Panther Lake where many defects would make it a tough sell, the three people said. Profit also flows from market expansions and building up factory output, Intel said.\n\nAn immense yield increase would be a tall task by Panther Lake's fourth-quarter launch, the two people with knowledge of Intel's manufacturing operation said. But without such a jump, Intel may have to sell some chips at a lower profit margin or at a loss, the two sources briefed on test data said.\n\nPanther Lake is \"fully on track,\" Intel said in its July 30 comment. Intel did not specify the yield threshold at which its chips become profitable.\n\nThe company has warned it could exit leading-edge manufacturing entirely if it does not land external business for 14A, which is 18A's next-generation successor.\n\nIntel's 18A process involved big manufacturing changes and introduced newer technologies all at once, such as a next-generation transistor design and a feature that would improve the delivery of energy to a chip. This created manufacturing risks due to the complexity of fabricating chips, three of the sources said.\n\nMore on Intel: 'This thing is going to happen': Licking Countians remain optimistic, despite Intel delay\n\nIntel took on this challenge to close the performance gap with TSMC, but its aggressive timeline for a rollout of unproven systems set it up for failure, said the two people briefed on the company's test data. One likened the effort to a \"Hail Mary\" football pass.\n\nIn April, Intel said it had begun a crucial step toward printing Panther Lake chips via 18A known as \"risk production.\" The company also showed off several laptops it said used Panther Lake chips at the Taiwan Computex expo in May.\n\nBut problems have persisted.\n\nOne way chip manufacturers gauge progress is to measure the number of defects per area of a chip, which can vary based on a semiconductor's design. Relative to industry standards, the Panther Lake chips had about three times too many defects for Intel to start high-volume production, the two sources briefed on test data said.\n\nAs of late last year, only around 5% of the Panther Lake chips that Intel printed were up to its specifications, these sources said. This yield figure rose to around 10% by this summer, said one of the sources, who cautioned that Intel could claim a higher number if it counted chips that did not hit every performance target. Reuters could not establish the precise yield at present.\n\nIn the interview with Reuters, Zinsner disputed these figures and said \"yields are better than that.\" He did not give a number for July or late 2024, and Intel declined to provide this data.\n\n\"Our expectation is every month they'll get better and better, such that we're at a yield level that is good for production-level Panther Lake at the end of the year,\" he said, adding: \"I wouldn't say that margins are accretive even at those yield levels, so we still have to make improvement.\"\n\nTan has tapped supply-chain contacts more than usual for Intel and has given them data to help improve chip yields, Zinsner said.\n\nFor now, Intel remains partly dependent on TSMC to make its in-house designed chips.

When the U.S. CHIPs and Science Act was signed in 2022 — providing $52 billion in subsidies to boost domestic chip manufacturing — the U.S. produced only about 10% of global chips. Despite this small manufacturing footprint, more than half of global semiconductor companies are headquartered in the U.S.\n\nSince then, some progress has been made toward boosting domestic chip manufacturing. Both Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have received funding from the CHIPs Act. TSMC has also committed to spending “at least” $100 billion over the next four years on chip manufacturing plants in the U.S.\n\nBut setting up chip manufacturing plants takes time. Intel recently announced it was delaying construction on its Ohio chip manufacturing facility, again, highlighting the challenges of rapidly scaling up production.\n\nThe tariff announcement comes as the industry awaits the administration’s decision on AI chip export restrictions — rules that control which countries can purchase advanced semiconductors used in AI systems.\n\nThe Trump administration formally rescinded the Biden administration’s chip AI export rules in May. Those rules had established a country-specific, multi-tier approach to restricting chip exports based on national security concerns. The Trump administration then released its AI Action Plan in July, which emphasized the need for the U.S. to implement chip export restrictions but was light on the details of what that could look like.\n\nAccording to reporting from Semafor citing industry sources, the Trump administration is now debating whether or not it should go through with its plan to rescind and replace Biden’s AI export rules.\n\nFor more on the semiconductor industry’s tumultuous year, we’ve compiled a regularly updated timeline of market news since the beginning of 2025.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:25:30.453798+00:00"}

It's the top producer of lithography systems, which optically etch patterns onto silicon wafers, and it serves all of the largest chip foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung and Intel.\n\nASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems are used to produce older and larger chips. It's also the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are used to produce the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips in the world.\n\nASML's monopolization of that technology makes it a linchpin of the semiconductor market. From 2014 to 2024, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 17%, its gross margin expanded from 44.3% to 51.3%, and its EPS rose at a CAGR of 22%. Over the past 10 years, its stock has rallied 610% and delivered a total return of 684% with its dividends.\n\nASML still seems like a sound long-term investment, but it's pulled back more than 30% from its record closing price of $1,085.93 per share last July. Let's see why its stock cooled off -- and if that pullback represents a compelling buying opportunity for patient investors.\n\nWhat happened to ASML over the past year?\n\nASML's net sales rose 14% in 2022 and 30% in 2023. That acceleration was driven by its rising shipments of DUV and EUV systems, the explosive growth of the AI market, stable service and upgrade revenue, and the gradual rollout of its newest high-NA EUV systems -- which are required to mass produce even smaller and denser chips (below the 2nm node) than its current low-NA EUV systems. ASML is barred from shipping its EUV systems to China, but it's still selling plenty of older DUV systems to Chinese chipmakers.\n\nBut in 2024, ASML's net sales only rose 3%, its gross margin stayed flat, and its EPS dipped 3%. Its growth cooled off as it lapped the AI market's initial growth spurt, its non-AI markets grew at a slower clip, and it was restricted from shipping some of its higher-end DUV systems to China. Its top customers also reined in their system upgrades.\n\nMetric Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Net Sales Growth (YOY) (9.5%) 11.9% 28% 46.4% 23.2% Bookings Growth (YOY) 23.7% 1.2% (22.8%) 9% (0.5%) Gross Margin 51.5% 50.8% 51.7% 54% 53.7% EPS Growth (YOY) (18.7%) 9.8% 31.5% 92.9% 47.1%\n\nBut in the first half of 2025, ASML's net sales rose by the double digits again as its gross margins expanded. That recovery was driven by AI tailwinds for the DRAM memory chip market, which offset a lot of the pressure from the unpredictable tariffs and tighter export curbs against China, and more upgrades to its high-NA EUV systems.\n\nFor the full year, ASML expects its net sales to rise 15% as its gross margin expands by nearly a percentage point to 52%. Analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow 14% and 24%, respectively. From 2024 to 2027, they expect its revenue and EPS to increase at a CAGR of 10% and 17%, respectively.\n\nWe should take those long-term estimates with a grain of salt, but ASML should dominate the crucial EUV market for the foreseeable future. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 25 times next year's earnings, it pays a forward dividend yield of 1%, and it will remain one of the most straightforward ways to invest in the secular expansion of the semiconductor market.\n\nTherefore, I think it's a great idea to accumulate more shares of ASML this year as the bulls look the other way.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:25:36.055362+00:00"}

While Intel remains committed to 18A—which will support its next three generations of products—canceling development of the next node, 14A, would mark a major twist. According to Bernstein analysts, the consequences for the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market would be significant, particularly for suppliers tied to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Intel accounts for 20–25% of logic foundry capex and 10–15% of total semiconductor capex. Lasertec Corp (TYO:6920) and ASML (AS:ASML) are among the most exposed, with Lasertec deriving an estimated 28% of revenue from Intel and ASML about 9%. “It is especially negative to Lasertec as Intel contributes a bigger part of its backlog,” analysts led by David Dai wrote, estimating about 40% exposure. High NA EUV adoption could also be delayed, as Intel was expected to be the first mover in that space. For materials suppliers, the benefits would skew toward TSMC’s (NYSE:TSM) ecosystem. Hoya, the sole EUV mask blank supplier to TSMC, could theoretically expand its market share to 100% if Intel exits manufacturing and AGC loses its role as Intel’s supplier. “Ibiden also has sizeable exposure to Intel but should be immune, assuming Intel continues advancing its backend packaging technology,” the analysts added. On the foundry side, TSMC stands to gain the most, with Samsung Foundry also well-positioned. “TSMC clearly will benefit if Intel turns fabless,” the team noted. They also added that Samsung (KS:005930) could emerge as a strategic alternative in leading-edge logic manufacturing. As for Intel, Bernstein sees a degree of desperation behind the announcement. “One semi-plausible thesis around this is that it is a cry for help to the administration coupled with a veiled threat,” the analysts said. Furthermore, they cautioned that Intel’s announcement could hurt its ability to attract major customers, especially if those customers begin to doubt the company’s long-term commitment to manufacturing. Ultimately, the decision, “while potentially necessary for Intel’s longer survival in some form, creates substantial disruption and uncertainty around both the business and the stock which it seems prudent to avoid,” Bernstein concluded. Intel shares dropped 8% on Friday after the company signaled a possible exit from chip manufacturing. CEO Lip-Bu Tan also announced plans to cut more jobs, halt construction on two planned facilities in Europe, and slow progress on a third in Ohio, effectively abandoning his predecessor’s strategy of investing heavily in new plants to regain manufacturing leadership.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:25:50.470933+00:00"}

Growing demand for graphics processing unit (GPU)-optimized servers tailored for AI workloads has been at the core of SMCI’s success. Super Micro Computer’s integration of Intel Gaudi, NVIDIA Blackwell Chips and AMD processors in its servers is likely to bring in more customers in high performance computing, AI and hyperscale space.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Super Micro Computer, Inc. Quote\n\nAnother key factor supporting the segment’s momentum is Super Micro Computer’s early availability of systems built on NVIDIA’s new Blackwell GPU architecture, alongside continued strength in Hopper-based systems. The expansion of the company’s Datacenter Building Block Solutions, which offers customers a one-stop integrated solution for servers, storage, networking and cooling, is expected to have further boosted adoption among enterprises and hyperscalers during the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nSMCI has also been capitalizing on strong customer interest in both air-cooled and DLC rack-scale platforms, which are essential for the next wave of AI data center expansion. Leadership in DLC technology has also been a powerful competitive advantage for Super Micro Computer. As AI training models become more resource-intensive, data centers are increasingly adopting DLC solutions to meet energy efficiency and density requirements. This trend is likely to have boosted the Server and Storage Systems segment’s revenues in the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, as many customers chose to wait for newer AI platforms, such as NVIDIA’s Blackwell, before placing orders, this might have hurt the company’s order book in the to be reported quarter. SMCI’s perpetual contraction of margin due to a variety of reasons like unfavorable product and customer mix, competitive pricing to acquire more customers, cost rise due to DLC AI GPU cluster deployments and higher upfront costs associated with ramping up production for its DLC technology is a matter of concern for the investors in the fourth quarter.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:26:01.053076+00:00"}

But no-one is immune from buying too high. For example the Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) share price dropped 59% over five years. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 32%. Even worse, it's down 13% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. Importantly, this could be a market reaction to the recently released financial results. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.\n\nSince Intel has shed US$12b from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver five years Intel's earnings per share dropped significantly, falling to a loss, with the share price also lower. At present it's hard to make valid comparisons between EPS and the share price. But we would generally expect a lower price, given the situation.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\n\nNasdaqGS:INTC Earnings Per Share Growth August 1st 2025\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\n\nWhat About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?\n\nWe'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Intel's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. Its history of dividend payouts mean that Intel's TSR, which was a 55% drop over the last 5 years, was not as bad as the share price return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nInvestors in Intel had a tough year, with a total loss of 31%, against a market gain of about 18%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade.

But Trump is essentially extorting certain companies to get things he wants from them. Clever CEOs are playing along, whether shareholders like it or not.\n\nExhibit A consists of Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which are basically buying export licenses from the Trump administration so they can sell semiconductors in China. Both companies have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from chip sales in China in exchange for the right to sell there.\n\n“My political head is spinning again with this new pay-to-play plan with Nvidia and AMD,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in an Aug. 11 analysis. “I pray for the sake of American free market capitalism that it stops here.\"\n\nThe Nvidia and AMD deals immediately bring to mind competitor Intel (INTC), which hasn’t yet agreed to cough up an export toll. Here’s a safe guess: It, too, will pay a similar fee for similar privileges.\n\nAt the moment, Intel is doing damage control. On Aug. 7, Trump directly attacked CEO Lip-Bu Tan, saying on social media that he “must resign, immediately.” Trump and some other Republicans seem to be concerned that Tan had improper connections with China’s military at another firm he ran until 2021.\n\nTan, a US citizen, met with Trump on August 12, to demonstrate his commitment to American interests, according to the Wall Street Journal. Something changed, because Trump called the meeting a \"success.\" That may indicate that money is forthcoming. Watch for Intel to pony up, just as Nvidia and AMD did.\n\nNvidia’s 15% gratuity to the government for chip sales to China will cost the firm about $3 billion per year. The company’s stock dipped on the news, then drifted up. Investors may have first thought only of the bottom line, then decided the payment would be better than losing chip sales to China completely. The hit to AMD would be smaller because its China sales are lower. AMD stock also dipped then rose following the news. Intel stock rose on news of Tan’s chat with Trump, as buyers hope the company’s damage-control effort pays off.\n\nTrump has engineered this whole scenario. In April, Trump tightened restrictions on US chip sales to China, essentially blocking the sale of certain chips. Nvidia said that move would cost the company $5.5 billion in lost revenue.

NeoLogic recently raised a $10 million Series A round led by KOMPAS VC with participation from M Ventures, Maniv Mobility and lool Ventures.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/neologic-wants-build-more-energy-120000626.html", "published_at": "2025-08-13T12:00:00Z", "source": "TechCrunch", "text": "When NeoLogic started building its more energy-efficient CPUs for AI servers, folks in the industry told its founders Avi Messica and Ziv Leshem that their idea wasn’t viable.\n\n“Most of the people that we have met say it’s impossible,” Messica told TechCrunch. “Some of them told us, at the time, that the innovation is impossible because you cannot innovate in logic synthesis. You can’t innovate in circuit design. It’s too mature.”\n\nIsrael-based NeoLogic nevertheless set out to prove them wrong, and the fabless semiconductor startup has been building a server CPU that uses more simplified logic — how a chip processes information — with fewer transistors and logic gates to run faster while requiring less power.\n\nNeoLogic was founded in 2021 by Messica, CEO, and Leshem, CTO, who together have 50 years of experience in the semiconductor industry. Leshem spent decades working on chip design at companies like Intel and Synopsis, while Messica focused on circuit design and the manufacturing side.\n\n“We co-founded this company more than four years ago because Moore’s Law was dead,” Messica said, referring to the 1960s observation that the number of transistors on microchips doubles every two years.\n\nAround a decade ago, Messica said, companies stopped trying to scale transistors down in size, because transistors had gotten so small, there wasn’t much more progress to be made there.\n\nBut, he says, NeoLogic wasn’t convinced. The startup is working with two hyperscaler partners on the design of the server CPUs, but Messica would not disclose their names. The company plans to have a single-core test chip by the end of the year, and hopes to get its server CPUs into data centers by 2027.\n\nNeoLogic recently raised a $10 million Series A round led by KOMPAS VC with participation from M Ventures, Maniv Mobility and lool Ventures. The company will use the funds to expand its engineering team and continue developing its CPUs.\n\nThe funding round comes as data centers are straining existing energy resources with no relief in sight. The ongoing AI boom has data center power usage expected to double in just the next four years.\n\nMessica hopes that NeoLogic’s energy-saving potential will help make its server CPUs too attractive for the market to ignore.\n\n“It affects everything,” Messica said of the potential energy savings. “If you talk about next-generation data centers, it affects the construction costs; it affects the amount of capital that you’ll invest because you can shave off roughly 30% of the cost. And it affects the water usage. It has an impact on society, and basically that was our vision roughly five years ago.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T14:39:24.148610+00:00"}

Shares rose 3.5% on Monday during the day as reports circulated about the meeting.\n\nCiting unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Tan was set to meet with Trump on Monday to explain his personal and professional background and to propose ways that Intel and the government can collaborate.\n\nLast week, Trump called for Tan's resignation in a Truth Social post minutes after Fox Business covered Republican Sen. Tom Cotton's recent criticism of the CEO over his ties with China. In a letter to Intel, Cotton expressed \"concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations,\" given Tan’s investments in Chinese businesses through his venture capital firm, Walden International.\n\nTrump wrote in his post last Thursday, \"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately.”\n\nTan responded by saying reports about his career contained \"misinformation.\"\n\n\"There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles ... I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I’ve built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem — and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,\" Tan wrote in a memo to employees.\n\nIntel also issued its own statement following Trump's comments, emphasizing its commitment to \"advancing US national and economic security interests\" and to making investments \"aligned with the President's America First agenda,\" including domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nTan was named Intel's CEO in March, taking over after his predecessor Pat Gelsinger was ousted by the board last year.
