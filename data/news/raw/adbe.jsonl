The company provides software for design and website creation. It's ideal for collaborating on projects. Back in 2022, Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) announced plans to acquire Figma for $20 billion, as it saw the business as a big part of its long-term growth. Regulatory hurdles, however, led to the deal being abandoned.\n\nNow, anyone can invest in Figma. And after the first few days of trading, the stock looked to be in high demand, hitting a high of just under $143 on Aug. 1 after opening at $85 the previous day. But since then, the stock has been sliding, as investors appear to be growing worried about its rapidly rising valuation.\n\nAre the concerns about Figma's valuation justified, or is the market simply taking a breather from a hot start? Here are the bullish and bearish cases for investing in Figma today.\n\nThe bullish case for investing in Figma\n\nOne of the attractive features of Figma is that it offers relatively affordable plans. For professionals, plans that feature Figma's full suite of design products cost just $16 per month. With Adobe, just a subscription to Photoshop alone costs $23 per month. And for the full suite of Creative Cloud products, users can pay as much as $70 per month.\n\nFigma may be appealing to users who don't need the advanced capabilities that come with Photoshop and other Adobe products. At a time when consumers are looking to cut costs, Figma's products can be attractive alternatives, especially since they make collaboration easy. Figma's business was enticing enough for Adobe to pursue it, but regulators in Europe saw the companies as potential competitors in the future, which is ultimately why the acquisition fell through.\n\nThe proof of Figma's popularity is evident in its strong growth. Last year, the company's revenue totaled $749 million, which was an increase of 48% year over year. And through the first three months of 2025, its sales totaled $228 million, representing a 46% increase.\n\nThe company currently has a net dollar retention rate of 132%, which means consumers are spending more with the business now than they did in the previous year. And a staggering 95% of Fortune 500 companies use Figma, with two-thirds of its users being non-designers, highlighting just how easy its software is to use.\n\nThe bearish cash for avoiding Figma\n\nFigma's business is promising, but it also comes with risks. A big one is a lack of profitability. In each of the past two years, the company has reported an operating loss. And while this year, it has been doing well, through the first three months, its earnings per share (EPS) totaled just $0.04. That would translate into an annualized EPS of $0.16 -- putting it at a price-to-earnings multiple of close to 500, given a share price of around $80. Even with respect to sales, the stock is expensive, trading at a price-to-revenue multiple of around 50.\n\nWhile the company has high gross margins, its operating expenses are also high. In the most recent quarter, they accounted for approximately three-quarters of Figma's top line. Without lower overhead and operating costs, it's going to be difficult for the company to generate much earnings growth.\n\nWhen investors are paying such high multiples for a business, they are effectively paying a premium for future growth. The problem is that artificial intelligence is enhancing many design tools and, thus, can give users many more alternatives. Such alternatives may even be more advanced than Figma's. That can make it challenging for the company to continue to grow at a rate fast enough to justify its high valuation. Amid slowing growth, the stock's valuation could drop drastically.\n\nShould you buy Figma stock today?\n\nFigma may seem like the shiny new tech stock to own right now, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it. There's growing competition in the design space, and for users looking to cut costs, there are plenty of free options to consider (I've been a Gimp user for years), which is why I'm not sold on Figma's long-term growth potential. It's doing well right now, but that's while its numbers still aren't all that big.\n\nUnless Figma's stock comes down significantly in price, I would steer clear of it.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:32:46.092663+00:00"}

Shutterstock shareholders have three options for their payout: they can receive approximately $28.85 in cash per share, exchange each of their shares for about 13.67 shares of Getty Images (GETY) common stock, or opt for a mixed package of 9.17 shares of GETY stock and $9.50 in cash for each Shutterstock (SSTK) share they own.\n\nShutterstock is down 32.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $19.66 per share, it is trading 46.5% below its 52-week high of $36.75 from August 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Shutterstock’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $402.02.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future.

The firm views the company's strategic shift away from underperforming clean technology investments as a positive, which should increase margins.\n\nWolfe Research upgraded Cummins (CMI) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $480 price target following the Q2 report. The firm believes that with growing data center exposure and leverage to an eventual truck upcycle, Cummins is \"very well positioned right now.\"\n\nSeaport Research upgraded Paramount Skydance (PSKY) to Neutral from Sell with no price target. A \"broad, technologically forward strategy\" has been announced, as expected, but without significant details or updated financial projections, which the firm believes will be lower than when the merger was announced last year.\n\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Elf Beauty (ELF) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $134, up from $114. The firm contends that consensus \"looks materially too low,\" noting that its forecasts are 18% above consensus in terms of FY27 adjusted EBITDA.\n\nPhillip Securities upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Neutral from Reduce with a price target of $127, up from $112. The firm cites stabilizing travel demand for the upgrade. It sees \"modest\" sales growth through 2025 for Airbnb, driven by stable travel demand and growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\n\n\nMelius Research downgraded Adobe (ADBE) to Sell from Hold with a $310 price target. The firm believes the software-as-a-service companies are in the \"early innings\" of multiple contraction given the shift to artificial intelligence, and cuts Adobe's 2026 and 2027 estimates.\n\nHSBC downgraded Trade Desk (TTD) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $56, down from $84. The company's Q2 report points to \"structural issues,\" the firm says, adding that Trade Desk is seeing a deceleration in growth despite a strong advertising market overall. Jefferies also downgraded Trade Desk to Hold from Buy with a price target of $50, down from $100.\n\nLake Street downgraded Tandem Diabetes (TNDM) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $12, down from $75, following a transfer in analyst coverage. While the firm appreciates \"the valuation is compelling\" and thinks the company should probably demand a higher multiple, shares may be range-bound until faster U.S. growth, competitive share-taking and gross margin improvement to support AEBITDA profitability are seen.\n\nRaymond James downgraded Haemonetics (HAE) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $78, down from $105.

So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that Adobe does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Adobe's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Earnings and Revenue Growth August 11th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Adobe is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.7% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.8% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:32:56.467642+00:00"}

AI is already transforming businesses. And it's already making some investors quite wealthy.\n\nThe right AI investments could make you plenty of money, too. But which stocks are great picks right now? Wall Street analysts have some ideas you might want to check out. Here are three AI stocks that analysts think could soar more than 40% over the next 12 months.\n\n1. Atlassian\n\nFinancial data and infrastructure provider LSEG surveyed 31 analysts in August who cover team collaboration and productivity software company Atlassian (TEAM -0.79%). Twenty-five of them rated the stock as either a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" The remaining six analysts recommended holding shares of the software company.\n\nWhat's even more striking is their expectations of how the stock will perform. The average 12-month price target for Atlassian reflects an upside potential of around 60%. Even the most pessimistic analyst thinks the stock could jump 23% over the next 12 months.\n\nAtlassian certainly needs a strong rebound. The stock has plunged roughly 30% year to date and is almost 50% below the 52-week high set in February. Several factors caused this steep decline, including disappointing quarterly results earlier this year and insider selling.\n\nHowever, Atlassian's business remains strong. The company's revenue jumped 22% year over year in its latest quarter to nearly $1.4 billion. CEO and co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes noted in the quarterly update, \"AI is fundamentally changing the way we work, and creating significant tailwinds for Atlassian in the process.\"\n\n2. Salesforce\n\nSentiment on Wall Street is also remarkably strong for Salesforce (CRM -0.53%). Of the 54 analysts LSEG surveyed in August, 42 rated the software stock as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\" Ten analysts recommended holding Salesforce, with one outlier thinking investors should sell the stock.\n\nSalesforce could have a lot of room to run. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock is 45% above the current share price. One especially bullish analyst thinks Salesforce could skyrocket more than 80% higher.\n\nLike Atlassian, though, Salesforce hasn't been a winner so far in 2025. Its stock is down almost 30% year to date. Some analysts are skeptical about the company's planned acquisition of data management provider Informatica for $8 billion.\n\nSalesforce, though, views the Informatica deal as a smart move to bolster its agentic AI strategy. While the company awaits the closing of the transaction, it recently launched Agentforce 3, a platform that helps organizations deploy AI agents at scale.\n\n3. Adobe\n\nWall Street is upbeat about Adobe's (ADBE 1.37%) prospects, too. Twenty-seven of the 40 analysts surveyed by LSEG in August rated the AI-powered software stock as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" Of the remaining analysts, 11 recommended holding Adobe, with two rating the stock as an \"underperform.\"\n\nThe average 12-month price target for Adobe reflects an upside potential of around 42%. One analyst, though, thinks the stock could soar nearly 79% higher over the next 12 months.\n\nIt's pretty much the same song but a different verse when it comes to Adobe's stock performance this year. Similar to Atlassian and Salesforce, Adobe has disappointed investors with its shares sinking more than 20%. The stock is more than 40% below its 52-week high set in September 2024.\n\nSome investors are concerned that Adobe's integration of generative AI into its suite of products could take longer than hoped to deliver a solid return on investment. Increasing competition is also seen as a threat.\n\nOn a positive note, though, Adobe reported record revenue in Q2 of $5.87 billion, up 11% year over year. And while there's some hesitance outside the company about its AI integration, customers seem to like what Adobe has done so far. CEO Shantanu Narayen noted in the Q2 earnings call, \"The creative opportunity is expanding across audiences with AI as an accelerant.\"", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:32:57.824077+00:00"}

It seems like it is going to happen over two. Service-based businesses with a high headcount, those are going to be really vulnerable, even if they have robust businesses from the last era of tech.”\n\nSo far, few companies have failed as a result of the proliferation of chatbots and so-called agents that can write software code, answer complex questions and produce photos and videos. But with tech giants like Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. pouring hundreds of billions into AI, investors have started to get more defensive.\n\nWix.com and Shutterstock are down at least 33% in 2025, compared with a 8.6% advance for the broad benchmark. Adobe has fallen 23% amid concerns clients will look to AI platforms that can generate images and videos, as Coca-Cola has already done with an AI-generated ad. ManpowerGroup Inc., whose staffing services could be hurt by rising automation, is down 30% this year, while peer Robert Half Inc. has shed more than half its value, dropping to its lowest in more than five years.\n\nThe souring sentiment among investors comes as AI is changing everything from the way people get information from the internet to how colleges function. Even companies at the vanguard of the technology’s development like Microsoft have been slashing jobs as productivity improves and to make way for more AI investments. To many tech-industry watchers, the time is nearing when AI becomes so pervasive that companies start going out of business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:33:06.636593+00:00"}

Despite modest rebounds, the design software firm’s stock has given back much of the increase that briefly mesmerized Wall Street.\n\nFigma’s 250% first-day pop was the largest in at least three decades for a US-listed company that raised more than $1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. After further gains last week that lifted the stock to more than quadruple the price IPO buyers paid, Figma is now trading at around $80, down from a peak of $142.92 on Aug. 1.\n\n“Figma was a testimony to the speculative nature of this market, abetted by some of the peculiarities of the IPO process,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Folks will probably lose interest and move onto the next situation if the stock persists below its opening print, even with the stock still up more than double over its IPO price.”\n\nPart of the raucous debut can be credited to a tiny pool of available shares to trade — just 7% of the outstanding stock is in the public domain — meaning it was partly a product of an imbalance in demand and supply.\n\nWhile recent debutants like Circle Internet Group Inc. have seen eye-popping returns, the drop off in trading volume and chatter on social media platforms that cater to individual investors show the group moved on after a few days as activity stalled. Recent IPOs including CoreWeave Inc. and Circle have more than tripled from their IPO prices, though both have wiped out more than 30% of their value from closing highs.\n\nFigma’s market value currently stands at roughly $39 billion, down from a closing peak of almost $60 billion. However, the current price is still well above the range investors had been pitched in meetings before the IPO.

That’s certainly what they promised when they entered office, and their appointments certainly signaled that they would be pursuing a more aggressive approach.\n\nThat has to be juxtaposed against the Trump administration, that seems to want to cut deals and settle cases or potentially go around its expert antitrust officials.\n\nWhat did you make of the recent firings of two DOJ officials around the HPE deal?\n\nThey had very skilled professionals who are well respected on both sides of the aisle at the Antitrust Division, and two of those officials were removed. It’s extraordinarily concerning and would be highly out of order, and suggests that the administration is not focused on doing the right thing for the right reasons, but instead trying to settle cases or cut deals based on pretextual arguments or political favors. I hope that’s not the case.\n\nAD\n\nCritics say that antitrust enforcement was politicized under Biden, too, for example, by making organized labor a focus in some merger reviews.\n\nI think it’s a false equivalency to suggest that protecting labor and protecting the ability of people to work and bask in the benefit of competition in terms of wages is somehow political. John Sherman — the namesake of the Sherman Act — talked at the time about protecting the ability of farmers to earn a living as one of the motivating factors for enacting antitrust laws.\n\nAntitrust is a matter of law enforcement, and to the extent a defendant feels like it’s being targeted or there’s overreach, they have the opportunity to go to court and challenge it. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but that’s why we have a process, and that’s why we have an independent judiciary.\n\nOur track record is something I’m quite proud of. We beat Google twice in court. Our cases have survived legal scrutiny by courts, including our cases against Apple and Ticketmaster. We brought important cases in real estate. We beat a case against American Airlines to help lower ticket prices. The Figma IPO just last week is another great example of our success at DOJ. We had a similar result with the Nvidia-Arm deal. Both were abandoned in the face of a challenge, and both resulted in companies staying independent and having success.\n\nHow should antitrust regulators be thinking about the growth of AI?\n\nAntitrust is most important at times of great change — when industries are experiencing an inflection point. That’s when, particularly in the tech space, incumbents have the greatest incentive to stifle new technologies.\n\nThe AT&T case helped give rise to integrated circuits and chips, which helped give rise to personal computers, and the IBM case preceded the growth and development of Microsoft. US v. Microsoft was brought at the dawn of the internet at the urging of companies like Netscape and helped give rise to the Googles and Facebooks and Amazons. Now we’re facing a similar inflection point, and companies like Google and others have every incentive to try to keep those new startups from reaching their full competitive potential and transforming the industry.\n\nA lot of the deals in AI are acqui-hires and licensing partnerships, rather than mergers. Is the antitrust toolkit equipped to respond?\n\nThey absolutely have the tools to go after those deals. You have to elevate substance over form. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s a duck. There’s a longstanding tradition for corporations to try to outsmart the law, but it’s the job of law enforcers to stay one step ahead.\n\nYou won a case declaring Google a search monopoly, right at the time that AI is threatening to upend everything. If, five years from now, search has been totally eaten by AI, and Google looks back and says, “See, we were right, and the DOJ was wrong,” is that still a win for you?\n\nDuring the Microsoft case [in the late 1990s], Microsoft made the argument that the internet and mobile was going to kill the operating system and therefore, there was no need for antitrust enforcement.\n\nThe government won the case. In the process, they established a really important precedent, which helped us win the most recent case against Google. It also allowed the internet and mobile devices and ecosystems to thrive without being stifled by an operating system monopoly of Microsoft.\n\nThe purpose of antitrust isn’t to pick winners or losers. It’s to preserve the competitive process so that companies can figure out in the marketplace what wins and what loses. The goal of bringing a case against a company like Google is to stop the anti-competitive behavior, deprive it of the fruits of its violations, and make sure markets are competitive going forward. What happens from there is up to industry.\n\nThere was a sense, perhaps a little unfair, that during the Biden administration there was a shift away or broadening beyond the consumer welfare standard. Do you agree that such an antitrust approach should have a broader theory of the case?\n\nConsumer welfare is a bit of a red herring, but it’s often used as a euphemism for less enforcement rather than more enforcement.\n\nIt was never the case that antitrust laws were only supposed to benefit consumers. It was always about the competitive process, because competition generates all sorts of benefits for society — greater innovation, lower prices, better working conditions, better wages, and frankly, a de-concentrated economy, which is not only relevant to corporate power, but political power.\n\nWhen you have highly concentrated markets, it could lead to companies that have not just an amazing amount of influence over consumers’ daily lives, but extraordinary influence over the political sphere, in terms of lobbying.\n\nM&A seems to be coming back. We’ve seen particularly consumer goods companies that are making promises about synergies and price cuts that often never materialize. How should antitrust regulators be looking at those promises?\n\nThose promises are made out of convenience and in order to encourage enforcers to approve a deal. One of the concerns that I had expressed during my tenure was relating to consent decrees and settlements. The government would approve the deal, require some sort of divestiture, and a year later, the divested assets were no longer competing effectively in the market. We have to be very careful about “improving deals,” and then signing off on transactions with consent decrees that don’t adequately fix the problem and provide no recourse in the event that the merger results in anti-competitive effects down the line.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:33:13.637834+00:00"}

The deal would ultimately fall apart, and today, most Figma's shareholders are likely thankful it did.\n\nFigma went public on Aug. 1, and its stock price more than tripled, quickly catapulting to a more than $59 billion market cap, due to insatiable demand from investors. Large IPOs have seen success this year, as the market has begun to thaw after a few difficult years. While Figma is certainly a very promising company and the stock has begun pulling back to a market cap of $44 billion, it's still valued for more than twice as Adobe's offer. Does Figma truly deserve this monstrous valuation?\n\nThe right ingredients to make a big splash\n\nAs I mentioned above, large IPOs like CoreWeave and Circle have performed tremendously well. It could perhaps be due to a lack of IPOs in recent years or exuberance around the crypto and artificial intelligence sectors. IPOs that can show big growth and some semblance of profitability have been met with high praise and excitement.\n\nAnd that's exactly what Figma offered. Between the first quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2025, Figma generated average quarterly revenue growth of 10%. In the second quarter of 2025, Figma grew revenue 41% year over year, and is now on pace for $1 billion in annual revenue. The company also achieved decent profitability in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. In its preliminary second-quarter results, management projected $9 million to $12 million in operating profits.\n\nAt Figma's initial projected valuation of $13.6 billion to $16.5 billion, that didn't look so bad in today's environment. Plus, Figma has an AI angle. The company is essentially the Google Sheets of design and user interface, allowing designers and coders to collaboratively build an array of projects with high-quality graphics. In 2023, Figma released Dev Mode, which easily translates designs into code. Other AI features on Figma include the ability to automate many tasks and First Draft, an AI tool that allows users to transition from a blank canvas to user interfaces that can be edited with a simple prompt.\n\nFigma already counts 95% of Fortune 500 companies as clients. Management also sees huge potential to incorporate more AI tools and capture business from the 1 billion new applications that are expected to be made by 2028.\n\nFact or Fiction: Figma should trade close to a $60 billion market cap?\n\nAt this valuation, Figma trades somewhere in the range of over 44 times 2025 revenue, assuming the company keeps growing quarterly revenue at a 10% rate. That is an extremely expensive valuation. If investors do view Figma as an AI play or a monopoly in the space, that could lead to a higher premium valuation.\n\nHowever, there's no certainty that Figma will hold this position forever because AI is clearly going to have a big use-case in design and coding. After all, OpenAI's ChatGPT already demonstrated some pretty impressive capabilities in this regard. Recently on CNBC, Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field said that superintelligence is not likely to replace Figma's graphics engine or technology.\n\n\"I think that's not stuff that you can learn from looking at code and sort of various places on the internet,\" said Field. \"It's not part of the pretraining data mix. I believe that doing that at scale -- it's quite difficult.\"\n\nHowever, it's really tough to know how far AI and superintelligence can go. Figma will also likely need to invest heavily in AI. I certainly think Figma has strong potential, and I did expect the stock to jump out of the gate. But at this kind of valuation, the stock has run too far, too fast. The risk-reward proposition is no longer favorable, which is why I think investors should wait for dips before buying.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:33:19.142756+00:00"}

Adobe Systems currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nDigging into valuation, Adobe Systems currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 16.42. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 23.49, which means Adobe Systems is trading at a discount to the group.\n\nIt's also important to note that ADBE currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.32. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Computer - Software industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.2.\n\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 73, placing it within the top 30% of over 250 industries.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:33:20.879143+00:00"}

Its margins are elite. But is this design darling worth 300x earnings?", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/figma-300x-earnings-bubble-hype-145423722.html", "published_at": "2025-08-06T14:54:23Z", "source": "GuruFocus.com", "text": "Figma monetizes by seat type: high-value creator seats for designers and discounted seats for collaborators and engineers. This tiered structure expands TAM and increases average revenue per customer. In Q1 2025, 70% of revenue came from Organization and Enterprise plansa clear sign that land-and-expand is working.\n\nThe product's simplicity hides its depth. Over 95% of the Fortune 500 has adopted Figma. Its viral, bottom-up go-to-market strategy turns one free user into an enterprise contract over time. Design teams start for free. Product managers join in. Developers get Dev Mode seats. Eventually, IT upgrades to an organization-wide license.\n\nIt started with interface design. But it didn't stop there. FigJam allows for collaborative whiteboarding. Dev Mode helps engineers ship faster. Figma Slides and Sites aim to replace presentation tools and even light web development. The roadmap is clear: become the operating system for digital product creation.\n\nFigma builds browser-based tools for digital product design. Designers use it to create wireframes, prototypes, and UI/UX flows. Developers use it to inspect designs and export code. PMs and marketers comment directly inside shared files. No downloads. No version control nightmares. Just a seamless, multiplayer canvas in the cloud.\n\nRight after being listed, it was trading publicly with a market cap around $60 billion, and after a recent pullback, now trades around a $40 billion market cap, Figma offers a rare opportunity to own a generational software business at a more reasonable multiple. Figma has emerged as the category king in browser-based design collaboration. But this story isn't about hype. It's about fundamentalsand whether this beloved product has the staying power and economic muscle to justify its price tag.\n\nIn that spirit, let's talk about Figma ( NYSE:FIG )the company that Adobe ( NASDAQ:ADBE ) tried to acquire for $20 billion in 2022, only to be blocked by regulators. The $20B Adobe acquisition wasn't just a headlineit was a validation. When the heavyweight in creative software offers a massive premium to eliminate a competitor, you know it sees something dangerous. And when regulators block the deal on antitrust grounds? That's not just a moat. That's a regulatory-confirmed threat.\n\nWhen I evaluate a company, I don't look at momentum charts or earnings surprises. I ask a more fundamental question: Would I want to own the entire business for the next 10 years? Not the stock. The business.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnd it's not just usage growth. Figma's plugin ecosystem (with over 10,000 community-built extensions) makes it more valuable the more you use it. Want to add stock images? Charts? Sync to Jira? There's a plugin for that. These integrations create lock-inand reinforce Figma's moat.\n\nA Financial Engine Hiding in a Design Tool\n\nLet's look under the hood. Figma's revenue has grown at an extraordinary pace:\n\nFigma at 300x Earnings: Bubble Hype or the Next Great Compounder?\n\nThat puts Figma on a $900M+ annualized run rate. More importantly, its growth is efficient. Net revenue retention was ~134% in 2024, meaning existing customers increased spend by 34% before adding new logos. Gross margins stand at 88%. Operating margin hit 17% in Q1 2025. Net income reached $45M.\n\nThat makes Figma one of the rare high-growth SaaS companies that's already profitable. Its Rule of 40 score (growth rate + operating margin) was 63 in Q1well above the benchmark of 40. This isn't a grow-at-all-costs story. It's a business with real earnings power.\n\nCapex is negligible. Free cash flow is strong. There's no debt. And the company exited Q1 2025 with $1.54 billion in cash. This is a self-funding, capital-light business with plenty of fuel.\n\nValuation in Context: Figma vs Other Competitors\n\nOf course, all of this doesn't mean Figma is cheap. When it reached $60B market cap and projected ~$200M net income, Figma traded at roughly 300x forward earnings and 65x forward revenue. Now at a $38B market cap Figma trades at ~200x forward earnings and ~44x forward revenue. Still priceybut more grounded after the recent pullback. That puts it at the upper end of high-growth SaaS multiples.\n\nSo how does that compare?\n\nAdobe trades at ~15.9x forward earnings and ~6x forward sales. Gross margins: 89%. Growth: ~10% annually.\n\nCanva (private) was last valued at ~$26B with ~$2B in ARR. That's ~13x sales.\n\nAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) trades at ~46x forward earnings and ~8x revenue. Gross margins: ~82%. Growth: 23%.\n\nFigma at the hype, trades at nearly 300x forward earnings and ~30x revenue. Gross margins: 88.3%. Growth: 48%.\n\nFigma at 300x Earnings: Bubble Hype or the Next Great Compounder?\n\nIn plain terms, Figma is much more expensive than Adobe, Canva, or Atlassian. But it's also growing faster, with higher margins and earlier-stage reinvestment opportunities.\n\nWIX (NASDAQ:WIX) apears to be one of the closest comparablescapital-light, sticky, and widely used. But WIX's ARPU (Average revenue per user) remains low because users log in infrequently. Adobe and Figma, by contrast, are deeply embedded into daily workflows. Designers, PMs, and developers live inside the product for hours every day. That kind of engagement drives much higher ARPU and makes Figma more comparable to Adobe or Atlassian in terms of monetization potential.\n\nSo how big is the market?\n\nTake the ARPU of Adobe's most-used cloud productaround $300400 per yearand multiply that by the estimated 300 million users across design, product, and engineering teams (a proxy drawn from Atlassian's global user base). Even if Figma captures just 10% of that market, you're looking at $912 billion in annual revenue potential.\n\nWith a capital-light model and a path to 30% net margins, Figma could generate multi-billion-dollar earnings over time.\n\nThe real question isn't whether Figma is expensive today. It's whether it can grow into that valuationand whether its competitive advantages are durable enough to sustain long-term compounding.\n\nCompetitive Edge and Moat\n\nWhat's stopping someone from cloning Figma? Technically, not much. But strategically? A lot.\n\nFigma's moat comes from a few intertwined forces:\n\nNetwork effects: The more people inside a company use Figma, the more valuable it becomes. Teams standardize on it. New hires already know it. Switching tools would be painful. High switching costs: Enterprise customers build design systems, component libraries, and workflows directly inside Figma. Leaving would mean breaking all of that. Ecosystem lock-in: Thousands of plugins, tutorials, community-created templates. No rival offers that breadth. Brand dominance: Designers love Figma. PMs tolerate it. Developers respect it. That trifecta is rare.\n\nAdobe failed to beat it with XD. Sketch has faded. Canva serves a different market. Miro, Notion, and others nibble at adjacent spaces but can't match Figma's depth in interface design.\n\nAnd while AI is a potential disruptor, Figma is leaning into it. Figma Make (prototype from text prompt) and other AI tools are being built in-house. The goal: automate the boring parts of design without replacing the designer.\n\nManagement: Aligned and Focused\n\nDylan Field still leads the company. He owns ~50% of voting rights. His strategic moves post-IPO suggest discipline. Instead of splashy M&A, Figma doubled down on its core platform. It scaled responsibly. It expanded pricing tiers. It accelerated product cadence.\n\nThe one wart? In 2024, the failed Adobe acquisition triggered a massive $889M stock comp expense. But this was a one-off to retain talent. Strip it out, and Figma would've been profitable in 2024 too. Field also brought in heavyweights like Bill McDermott (ServiceNow CEO) to the board. That blend of youthful vision and enterprise wisdom is a good sign. And he's not the only one leaning in. Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management has recently added to its position, purchasing 60,000 shares of Figma. That kind of vote of confidence from a high-conviction, innovation-focused investor tells you something. ARK isn't in the business of indexingthey're betting on exponential curves. If they believe Figma is still early in its compounding journey, it's worth paying attention.\n\nDylan built Figma from scratch, rejected early buyout offers, and steered through the Adobe drama. He's not optimizing for short-term optics. He's playing a longer game. Another key signal? Only 10% of total shares were sold during the IPO, and 30% of the capital raised was reinvested back into Figma. The limited float has fueled some of the post-IPO volatility, but it also tells you something else: the insiders didn't cash out. They held on. That kind of convictionespecially from a founder like Dylan Field with majority voting controlshouldn't be ignored. They're still playing the long game. That's exactly the kind of alignment I want to see.\n\nRisks Worth Watching\n\nEvery great story has risks. For Figma, they include:\n\nOverpricing seats: As Figma adds roles and charges per seat, cost-sensitive customers might balk. CFOs could push back.\n\nEnterprise saturation: 95% of the Fortune 500 use Figma, but only ~1,000 pay $100k+. Can those accounts grow to $500k+?\n\nComplacency: If Figma slows innovation, competitors will catch up.\n\nAI disruption: If generative tools reduce the need for manual design, seat counts might shrink.\n\nFounder concentration: Dylan Field has majority voting control. Great if he stays sharp. Risky if he drifts.\n\nThat said, none of these risks are fatal. They simply require focus.\n\nRiding the Volatility: Risk or Opportunity?\n\nFigma's recent valuation haircutfrom $60B to $40Bwasn't about fundamentals. It was a reminder that even the best businesses can't escape short-term volatility. Short-term traders might flinch. But long-term investors should see the share price plunge as a potential gift. When price diverges from value, opportunity knocks. If the core business remains intactand it doesthe volatility is your entry point, not your exit sign.\n\nSo, Would I Buy the Whole Business?\n\nIf I could buy Figma outright for $40 billion, I'd be acquiring more than just a design tool. I'd be getting a $900 million-plus run-rate business growing at 45% a year, with 88% gross margins and real free cash flow. I'd be getting a product that dominates its category and is entrenched inside 95% of the Fortune 500. I'd be buying into a thriving ecosystemthousands of plugins, loyal users, and workflows that teams can't live without. I'd be backing a founder-CEO who still owns the mission, executes relentlessly, and plays long-term. And I'd be inheriting a pristine balance sheet with zero debt and over $1.6 billion in cash. In short: this isn't just softwareit's a compounding engine hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe only question is whether I'd be overpaying for perfection.\n\nIf Figma compounds at 50% a year for the next five years and settles at a 30% net margin, the math gets simple fast: a ~900 million revenue run-rate today grows to roughly $6.8$6.9 billion, which translates into about $2 billion in annual earnings at maturity. At today's ~$40 billion market cap, you're effectively paying ~20 those Year-5 earnings.\n\nIf the market still values a dominant, high-ROIC software franchise at 3540 earnings, that implies $70$80 billion of equity value; if it compresses to ~25, you're closer to $50 billion. In other words, at 50% compounding with 30% margins, today's price isn't euphoricit's a bet on execution and multiple durability. Deliver the growth and hold a sensible premium multiple, and this looks fair to attractive in hindsight; miss on either lever, and the upside tightens.\n\nBut one thing's clear: This is one of the best software businesses of the last decade. Whether you buy now or wait for a pullback, Figma deserves a spot on every long-term investor's radar. Because price is what you pay. Value is what you get. And in Figma's case, the value is real. The price? That's up to your risk tolerance.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:33:23.648300+00:00"}

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -8.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Adobe falls in, has gained 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAdobe is expected to post earnings of $5.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.27 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Adobe.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:33:35.565671+00:00"}

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Adobe's ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Adobe is:\n\n60% = US$6.9b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2025).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.60 in profit.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Adobe\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nAdobe's Earnings Growth And 60% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Adobe has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Adobe's moderate 5.4% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Adobe's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 22% in the same period.\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Past Earnings Growth August 4th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is ADBE fairly valued?

While Adobe cited the lack of a “clear path” to approval from the European Commission and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, the acquisition also faced regulatory scrutiny in the United States over concerns that it could prevent Figma from being an “effective competitor” to Adobe.\n\nKhan was FTC chair at the time, leading the agency to challenge Big Tech on fronts including startup acquisitions — to the point that companies tried to avoid this scrutiny with “reverse acqui-hires” in which they hired key team members and licensed technology rather than acquiring startups outright. (The practice seems to be continuing despite Khan’s departure from the FTC.)\n\nWhile her aggressive stance led to intense criticism from corners of the tech industry, she defended her approach by saying that only a tiny percentage of deals received “a second look” and arguing that founders would ultimately benefit from “a world in which you have six or seven or eight potential suitors” rather than “just one or two.”\n\nAnd although Khan — who’d been appointed by President Joe Biden — resigned at the start of the second Trump administration, her comments Friday paint the Figma IPO as a vindication for her approach, calling the IPO “a win for employees, investors, innovation, and the public.”\n\nOf course, Khan’s critics are more likely to see Figma’s success as coming despite regulatory scrutiny, not because of it. For example, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told Business Insider, “Figma is a massive success, but it’s because of the company’s innovative growth and not due to the FTC and [Khan].”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:33:43.215605+00:00"}

And with Friday’s further jump —6% in recent trading—its market capitalization is approaching $60 billion, close to half of Adobe’s (ADBE).\n\nThat’s also roughly three times the $20 billion Adobe offered to pay for it in 2022, in what was widely seen as an acknowledgement that Figma could—at least in some ways—be beating the design giant at its own game. (Pressure from regulators, who viewed the bid as a bald attempt from Adobe to knock out competition, killed that deal.)\n\nFigma Eyes AI With Its 'Most Innovative Days' Ahead\n\nIn the less than 10 years since Figma launched its software publicly in 2016, it’s become a mainstay of the design world, particularly for its strengths in real-time collaboration, interactive features, and AI integrations. An estimated 95% of Fortune 500 companies use it, with its clients including many tech heavyweights like Amazon (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), and Netflix (NFLX).\n\nFigma reported first-quarter net income of $44.9 million on revenue that jumped 46% year-over-year to $228.2 million, according to a regulatory filing. CEO Dylan Field, a budding billionaire thanks to this week's gains, said he expects further growth, with big plans in AI.\n\nFigma’s revenue surged 48% last year to $749 million.

Since then, Field has led the company to meteoric success and a historic IPO.\n\nFifteen years ago, Dylan Field was a freshman computer science student at Brown University. On Thursday, the company he started in college and now runs, Figma, made its blockbuster debut on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the largest U.S. venture-capital-backed tech IPO in four years.\n\nFigma’s stock surged 250% on its debut, making it the largest first-day pop for a billion-dollar tech IPO and cementing its status as a bellwether for a resurgent tech IPO market. Demand was so intense that many hopeful investors received only a handful of shares, while trading was temporarily halted due to volatility.\n\nClosing at $115.50, the IPO instantly catapulted Figma’s valuation to nearly $68 billion—more than triple Adobe’s failed $20 billion acquisition offer for the company just two years ago.\n\nThe multibillion-dollar company, however, began with an idea thought up by Field and cofounder Evan Wallace, who was a Brown teaching assistant at the time. The duo explored the potential of new browser technologies and began brainstorming ways to democratize creative design through software. But it wasn’t until 2012, when Field was awarded the prestigious Thiel Fellowship, a $100,000 grant for young entrepreneurs willing to leave college that he and Wallace dove headfirst into what became Figma, the popular web-based design tool used for user interface and user experience design.\n\nField, now 33, was always a high achiever, especially with technology. At age three, he taught himself to use his family computer, and his interest in robotics began early in childhood. In the early 1990s, Field also worked as a child actor, starring in several commercials, including one for Windows XP. But ultimately his academic successes landed him at the Rhode Island Ivy League school and several competitive tech internships.\n\nThe Penngrove, Calif., native held several part-time gigs while studying at Brown, including a nine-month stint as a research assistant at Microsoft, a four-month data analytics internship at LinkedIn, and two internships at aggregation software company Flipboard—first as a software engineering intern and then a product design intern. His second Flipboard stint was part of the Kleiner Perkins Fellows Program, a highly competitive program that places selected students with companies in the Kleiner Perkins portfolio.\n\nIt was through his LinkedIn and Flipboard jobs that Field secured seed investments for his entrepreneurial ventures and eventually propelled himself to billionaire status by 33 years-old. Both his LinkedIn manager Peter Skomoroch and Danny Rimer, a general partner at Index Ventures who recognized Field’s potential during a Flipboard board presentation, helped the young founder finance his start.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:33:46.493980+00:00"}

You mentioned Figma's biggest customers there, but there are many more. In fact, you know, Figma boasts as a result of its AI tools that one of its customers that we know quite well here on Yahoo Finance, Vanguard, the investment management firm, it can design 50% faster because of Figma. And even the European car giant Volkswagen is another big customer of theirs as well. And in the IPO listing, you know, they they mentioned Netflix and Duolingo as well as as being customers too. But remember one key reason that Figma have gone public is down to the fact that there was a collapsed deal between itself and Adobe. That deal was originally announced back in September 2022, but fell apart the next year and it would have seen Adobe acquire Figma for a combination of cash and stock that would have valued the firm at roughly 20 billion dollars. Now on yesterday's closing price, Figma would have a valuation of 68 billion dollars. And now interestingly, it was actually the regulator here in the UK that objected to that deal. The competition and markets authority said that it was worried that the merger could lessen competition in the markets for things like product design, image editing, and illustration software. So the US IPO market, though it's improved over the second quarter, you know, according to S&P Global, there've been 59 offerings that have raised about 15 billion dollars. That's up from 45 offerings that raised 11.2 billion in Q1. But another major center is London and the story here is not so bright. Fundraising from new listings has actually fallen to a 30 year low. The London Stock Exchange Group revealed better than expected earnings yesterday, but the markets didn't like what they heard. Shares fell pretty sharply and they're actually carrying on falling sharply today as well. I actually did catch up with the the boss of the of LSE, as it's better known, David Schwimmer and he's really insisted. He says that London can still compete with New York when it comes to new listings.\n\n04:54 David Schwimmer\n\nSome of the challenges of going to New York. A lot of companies, if they're not above a certain size and have a, I'll say a particularly hot story, they get lost in the US capital markets in in New York. They don't get the right attention from investors, from research analysts. Uh and so we've had conversations with companies like that who are actually looking for an environment where they will get the appropriate attention from investors. So is it a great market for some companies? Absolutely. But there are many companies where it makes much more sense to be listed and trading in the UK. So is London better than New York?\n\n06:06 David Schwimmer\n\nI would say for certain companies, absolutely.\n\n06:48 Speaker B\n\nSo he insists London is better than New York. One thing he also insisted was that London still remains the number one destination for business in Europe. Uh but you know, he faces big challenges. He says there are IPOs coming. He says watch out next week for a European listed company that to to launch here in London as well. But you know, the competition is pretty hot and it's not just New York. There's also Hong Kong as well that's had a a pretty decent sort of last couple of months as well. But you know, the competition for listing is very hot at the moment and New York at the moment seems to be winning that battle.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:33:51.303772+00:00"}

Less than two years ago, in December 2023, software giant Adobe abandoned a $20 billion acquisition of Figma, the maker of cloud-based design tools for building website and app interfaces. The deal unraveled after antitrust regulators in the US and Europe expressed such vociferous concern that Adobe didn’t even bother with seeking formal approval.\n\nFigma shareholders ought to thank them: The company’s shares soared 250% in their New York Stock Exchange debut yesterday, yielding a market capitalization of $47 billion, or more than double Adobe’s offer. Other companies flirting with initial public offerings (IPO), like a certain Swedish fintech, may soon follow the encouraging developments.\n\nWake-Up Call\n\nThe IPO market, as you probably know, entered a bear-like hibernation after its 2021 peak. Central banks started hiking interest rates to lance white-hot inflation, the knock-on effect being an increased cost of capital (which makes it harder to borrow and finance growth). There was hope this slumbering bear would emerge from its cave this year, soothed by the honeyed business outlook of the new administration. Instead, the first half of 2025 ended up meh.\n\nOn the one hand, the US saw 109 IPOs, the most in the first half of a year since 2021. But the proceeds (the actual money raised in those offerings) fell to $17.1 billion from $18.8 billion in the first half of 2024, according to an EY analysis. To emphasize just how far things have fallen, the first half of 2021 saw 219 US IPOs that brought in $85.1 billion. Much of the gap can be explained by economic uncertainty due to the Trump administration’s saber-rattling about tariffs, which has left the Federal Reserve hesitant to cut rates so far this year. But Figma’s debut on Thursday was the latest in a series of encouraging signs:\n\nOn top of the software developer’s sterling debut, recent weeks saw online bank Chime and stablecoin issuer Circle debut (the former up 27% from Chime’s $27 June IPO price, the latter up over 490%). AI data center company CoreWeave, which debuted in March, is up almost 200%.\n\nSo take it as no surprise that buy-now-pay-later fintech Klarna, which filed for an IPO in March but punted amid the tariff uncertainty in the months to follow, is considering listing as early as next month, according to sources who spoke to Bloomberg News. The outlet reported that the recent run of strong debuts is a factor in Klarna’s thinking; EY’s research bolsters the case for momentum, noting that June accounted for nine of the 16 IPOs that raised more than $50 million in the second quarter.\n\nWhat M&A Has to Say: There are signs that another core part of corporate activity, mergers and acquisitions, is also proving resilient amid escalating tariffs. In the first half of the year, the value of announced M&A deals reached $1.2 trillion, the highest in three years, S&P Global research said this week. “As markets have largely shrugged off initial tariff uncertainties with multiple pauses, deals have resumed relatively quickly,” wrote the ratings agency. Listings could follow suit, as “the IPO market appears poised to build on recent momentum,” according to EY’s analysis (especially if trade negotiations stay subdued compared to a dramatic April that sent Klarna into a hibernation cave of its own for a few months).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:33:58.877386+00:00"}

The marketed range was raised on Monday to $30 to $32 a share from $25 to $28.\n\nFigma launched its listing on July 21 with its eye on a fully diluted valuation of as much as roughly $16 billion, well below the figure in the Adobe deal. That target was still positioned as a victory, coming after a tender offer last year valuing the design-focused company at $12.5 billion.\n\nInvestors have handsomely rewarded Figma for its rapid growth, and the IPO’s bankers made sure their enthusiasm wouldn’t go unnoticed.\n\nAccounting for employee stock options and restricted stock units, including RSUs for Field, the company’s fully diluted value is more than triple what Adobe had agreed to pay in cash and stock. Figma may never again be so cheap, and as it battles with Adobe and Australian startup Canva Inc. to dominate the use of artificial intelligence in creative tools, the company’s soaring shares may open the door to some dealmaking of its own.\n\nAdobe’s planned acquisition of Figma, which at the time would have been the biggest-ever takeover of a private software company, was panned by the Photoshop maker’s shareholders, who sent its stock down nearly 17% the day the deal was announced. Today that deal looks like a bargain.\n\nShares of the San Francisco-based firm closed at $115.50 each on Thursday in New York, more than tripling the IPO price of $33 apiece. The trading gives Figma the largest first-day pop in at least three decades for a US-traded company raising more than $1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It also makes Field one of the world’s richest people.\n\nThe design and collaboration software company led by Dylan Field, who started the firm in 2012 with a friend from Brown University, soared above the $20 billion mark it would have fetched had a sale to Adobe Inc. not been scrapped in 2023.\n\nThe finely choreographed process for the $1.2 billion IPO, culminating in a fully diluted valuation of more than $65 billion, also puts rivals on notice that Figma’s ambitions are expanding.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Figma Inc.’s 250% surge in its debut session is the kind of coming-out party every startup dreams of when it goes public.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe shares offered in Figma’s IPO were ultimately more than 40 times oversubscribed, with more than half of the orders receiving no stock, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nThe pacing almost perfectly mirrored Circle Internet Group Inc.’s debut in June, which similarly laddered its price and share count increases ahead of its 168% first-day pop.\n\nA key question for Figma’s long-term success is whether it can become a tool used by office workers beyond designers. The company’s suite of tools is seeing strong adoption by software developers, product managers, and marketers, said Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia Capital and a member of Figma’s board.\n\nSequoia, one of the most storied Silicon Valley venture firms, first invested in Figma in 2019. Around that time, companies were beginning to adopt Figma’s product en masse, Reed said.\n\nLike many software firms, Figma charges clients based on the number of users and the kind of seat those users have. It added Dev Mode to the platform in 2023 to enable closer collaboration with developers, and has more recently incorporated AI technology into many of its own tools. This year it introduced Figma Make, an AI-based product that lets the user turn prompts into functional prototypes.\n\nThe use of AI-focused software creation apps that are potential competitors to Figma, such as Lovable and Bolt, has rapidly increased this year. Weaving AI features into Figma’s products is a top priority, Field said in an interview. “We have so much room to explore how we can make great AI products and experiences.”\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nFigma’s financial metrics stand above most large-cap software companies, with growth north of 40%, a net-dollar retention rate of over 130% and high pricing power given the lack of a credible rival.\n\n- Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard, technology analysts\n\nClick here to read the research.\n\nGoing public allows Figma to have a big brand moment which centers the importance of design, Field said. “This is a time where we can create tremendous value for our community, our customers, and I think the public market is the right place to do it.”\n\nAI isn’t the only fashionable technology Figma is embracing. The company’s board approved a $55 million investment in a Bitcoin ETF run by Bitwise Inc. last year, and signed off in May on a $30 million investment in the cryptocurrency, its IPO filings show. The company bought 30 million of Circle’s stablecoin USDC, valued at $1 each, and plans to reinvest the holdings into Bitcoin directly.\n\nFigma has also authorized the issuance of blockchain stock that could lead to selling blockchain-based tokens as a form of its shares, though it currently doesn’t have specific plans to do so, according to the filings.\n\nAcquisition Currency\n\nFigma’s bulldozing IPO campaign has produced a well-capitalized company whose stock can be currency in acquisitions — one of the potential uses detailed in Figma’s IPO filings — and whose growing footprint in creative work could make it a fierce rival to the company that once tried to absorb it.\n\nThe company mentioned just two acquisitions in its filings, the largest of which is a $35.5 million deal for Payload, an open source headless content management system. Field likely has bigger deals on his mind, based on the founder letter included in the IPO filing.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV, Field reiterated the pledge he made in the IPO filing’s founder letter that the company would pursue M&A at scale.\n\n“There’s so much out there which can be applicable to the company when you think of the breadth of product design and development,” he said. “It has to be an amazing team, an amazing asset, and has to be something where we think the team is culturally consistent.”\n\nAfter its acquisition plans were thwarted, Adobe discontinued XD, its most direct Figma rival. Like many software companies, Adobe’s current focus is adding AI features to its flagship creative products like Photoshop.\n\nAustralia-based Canva’s AI features are intended to speed the design process. In April, the company introduced a conversation-based AI tool, which responds to voice and text prompts to edit photos, generate slide decks and re-size designs.\n\nThe soaring share price also puts into play the performance-based awards Field has, including a 10-year “moon-shot” compensation package awarded just last month that begins to vest once the 60-day average stock price exceeds $60. The highest hurdle requires shares to top $130.\n\nField’s stake is worth $6.1 billion. He will continue to control the company with 74.1% of the voting power after the IPO through his holdings of Class B shares that have 15 votes each, the filings show.\n\nThe company sold 12.47 million shares in the IPO, which priced Tuesday, while investors including Index Ventures, Greylock Partners and Kleiner Perkins sold 24.46 million shares.

After pricing its initial public offering (IPO) at $33, the stock opened at $85 around 2:00 p.m. ET, 158% higher than the listing price, and then continued to climb from there.\n\nThe surge came as little surprise. Figma went public with the stock market at all-time highs, and with risk-on tech stocks back in favor, stocks like Nvidia have soared as tariff fears have cooled. Figma also has just about everything investors could want from an IPO, which also seemed to set the stock up to skyrocket in its debut.\n\nA model start-up\n\nIPOs are inherently risky, but there are a number of features that investors look for to persuade them that it's worth taking the risk. Those include strong revenue growth, profitability, a large addressable market, and scalability of the underlying product or service.\n\nFigma is the rare IPO that has all those qualities, and even better, it has a stamp of approval from the biggest company in its industry. Adobe (ADBE 1.37%), of course, tried to buy the company for $20 billion back in 2022, but regulators blocked the deal.\n\nThat event may be the biggest endorsement for Figma's IPO, as not only did the leader in design software want to acquire it, but it was also willing to pay a steep premium of $20 billion at the time. Additionally, the combination of the two companies was so feared by regulators that they blocked the deal on account of it having a negative impact on competition in the design software industry.\n\nYou can't ask for an IPO to prove itself much more than that, and the fact that Figma's IPO price valued the company for less than what Adobe offered nearly three years ago seemed like a gift to investors able to get their hands on the offering.\n\nFigma by the numbers\n\nIt's not just the Adobe deal that gives Figma street cred. Its quarterly numbers are rock-solid.\n\nOver its last four quarters, revenue has grown 46% to $821 million. Even better, the company is already generating wide operating margins on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis at 17%. There are plenty of software companies that have been public for years that remain unprofitable, as software investors tend to reward growth over profitability.\n\nFinally, it has a 91% gross margin, showing its core product is highly cost-efficient. That high gross margin makes it easier for the overall business to turn a profit, giving the company more money to spend on product development, sales, and overhead.\n\nThe operating margin of 17% also indicates that Figma's product and competitive position are strong enough that it doesn't need an outsize sales force to sell the product, a good sign for the long-term health of the business. Already, 78% of the Forbes 2000 uses Figma, showing big business has embraced the product. However, there is plenty of room for it to ramp up spending, as Figma believes it has a total addressable market (TAM) of $33 billion. That TAM is likely to grow.\n\nIs Figma a buy?\n\nIPOs are risky in part because it generally takes time for a stock to reach its equilibrium price, and investors may have to see a few more quarters of earnings reports before the post-IPO volatility runs its course.\n\nAs a business, Figma appears to have a bright future ahead of it, but after tripling on its IPO day, the stock now has a market cap of roughly $60 billion, giving it a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of around 70. That's a sky-high valuation for even the brightest of IPOs.\n\nAt that price, I'm more inclined to wait on the sidelines for now to see whether some of the IPO euphoria fades. I'd prefer to see the P/S ratio fall below 50, which is still pricey, before considering it a buy. That may not happen, but its current valuation seems hard to sustain, especially considering the much larger Adobe has a market cap of only $150 billion.\n\nInvestors shouldn't ignore valuation, but there's a lot to admire about Figma. It deserves a healthy premium from the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:34:06.801826+00:00"}

This would lead to one of his signature seed investments, in a startup called Figma.\n\nOn Thursday, Figma went public with the stock popping from the $33 IPO opening price to close at $115.50 and a $47 billion market cap. And Griffith could not be more effusive in his praise for the company.\n\n“You go to one of these user conferences and you’re like, there’s 15,000 people here and 5,000 have Figma tattoos,” Griffith smiled. From the earliest days, the founders of this company that offers software for designers had “a fervent desire to win and deliver and redefine this ecosystem.”\n\nYet in 2013 at that first meeting, co-founders Dylan Field and Evan Wallace were untested. And at that point, so was Iconiq. It was known then as the very secretive wealth management firm for many of Silicon Valley’s richest tech moguls, like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey.\n\nFigma, however, already had a champion: Field had been an intern at LinkedIn under its then CEO Jeff Weiner. Weiner was an angel investor (and bought more stock at later rounds, too) and introduced Field to Griffith.\n\n“We got connected to Figma before we had an early fund, before we had any venture fund,” Griffith told TechCrunch. The investor remembers trekking out to meet the founders. “It was like two guys and the dog in an apartment in Palo Alto, and they were working on these newfangled graphics and design capability in a browser.”\n\nThe demo showed how light could be manipulated when editing a photo in a browser. At the time, browser-based design software, based on WebGL, was revolutionary. Tech giant Adobe had the graphics design market locked up with its desktop software. “I thought it was insane,” Griffith recalled.\n\nThe idea was so unproven Alexis Ohanian, who was investing out of his then firm Initialized, passed on Figma when he saw the product years later in 2016, he noted in a tweet this week. Ohanian called Figma a member of his “embarrassing miss-list.”\n\nBut Griffith wrote a check. Seed shares, by the way, were priced at $0.0878 each, Figma disclosed in its S-1A. And Griffith wrote more checks as Figma raised additional rounds. The company raised a total of about $332 million in venture funding through 2024, PitchBook estimates.\n\n“We invested in the seed. We invested in the Series A. We invested further. We did some secondary and we also invested more meaningfully a year ago,” Griffith said.\n\nIconiq did not wind up owning at least 5% of the company, a bar that would require Figma to publicly disclose the size of its stake. But it owns enough that the IPO will be celebrated at the Iconiq offices.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:34:08.650373+00:00"}

The trading gives Figma the largest first-day pop in at least three decades for a US-traded company raising more than $1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThe first-day trading gives Figma a market value of $56.3 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings.

The soaring share price also puts into play the performance-based awards Field has, including a 10-year “moon-shot” compensation package awarded just last month that begins to vest once the 60-day average stock price tops $60.

The company and its early shareholders raised $1.2 billion in its IPO on Wednesday, with shares priced at $33.

Adobe, with a market cap of around $152 billion, will now be Figma’s key public markets competitor as the upstart chases market share. Praveer Melwani, Figma’s CFO, told Fortune on Thursday morning that it will be business as usual for Figma moving forward, with possible acquisitions in the pipeline.\n\n“Candidly, the way we’re running this—or the way the offering shaped up—it’s a majority secondary transaction with a small portion of primary that facilitates to pay the tax that’s owed on the RSU [restricted stock unit] settlement,” said Melwani, who became Figma’s first business operations head in 2017. “So, we’re net neutral from a cash impact on technology. The story stays the same.

Greylock venture partner John Lilly told Fortune that Figma and Field are well-positioned.\n\n“The way we’re going to be interacting with more systems and technology over time means interfaces have to be designed right,” said Lilly. “Figma is the way organizations design together, it’s sort of the operating system… As long as we keep investing and keep making sure that we’re on top of AI—integrating the best tools and creating some of them—then AI looks like a huge opportunity to me.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:34:18.209313+00:00"}

What we saw there was once again another fast casual chain reiterating that consumers are really cautious right now. They're inflationary, inflation weary, rather, and they're really counting their pennies. They're looking for the best bang for their buck. And as we heard from Chipotle, value proposition is everything nowadays. And it seems like consumers are trying to assess where they can get that. And certainly what we saw here was that forecast when it comes to the next quarter, really, uh, you know, what we saw was that there was high expectations here. Now they're expecting that revenue to not be in line with what Wall Street had expected. The CFO though did say on the call that traffic as each month went on did improve. But Julie, they came out with that Dubai shake this past quarter. And so there was lots of optimism about what this could look like. They did say that even though consumers came in for just that pistachio viral shake, that it actually drove up the ticket there. But they did say that there was ways that they could certainly work on making sure that they hold on to that share, hold on to that value proposition. But despite a small single digit increase in same store sales growth, when you think back to a few years ago, we were posting double digits when it came to their same store sales growth, or as they call it, same shack sales growth.\n\n02:47 Speaker A\n\nHave you tried the Dubai shake?\n\n02:56 Brooke DePalma\n\nI didn't, but maybe now I will. That sounds really good. I'm reading about it right now. Okay. Next up, speaking of consumables, AB InBev, the parent company of Bud Light, dropping by the most in five years today. The company sold less beer than expected during the second quarter with a downturn in consumer spending in Brazil and China in particular, dragging on sales. And I believe you had a chance to talk to the company, Brooke.\n\n03:26 Brooke DePalma\n\nYeah, I spoke to the CEO this morning and what he said is that when it comes to China, the consumer that they're seeing there, they're overindexed in restaurants and bars, as well as the eastern region of the country, rather. And what they know is that this consumer there is staying at home. And so they really have to re-evaluate, especially as perhaps beer isn't top of mind for that consumer as well. And over in Brazil, the story there that really led to those volumes declines is poor weather, as well as a value-seeking consumer. And to bring it back home here in the US, he said that they're also seeing a value-seeking consumer here in the US. He said, quote, some pockets of consumers are more under pressure due to inflation in the last few years, and those once again are value-seeking consumers. And here in the US, we did see sales to retailers decline yet again. But he said that there's this momentum behind these value-oriented brands like Busch Light, as well as low carb, low calorie brands like Michelob Ultra. And those are two brands he certainly has an eye on, and he expects to outperform in this sort of environment.\n\n05:05 Speaker A\n\nAnd thanks, Brook. And finally, Figma raising $1.2 billion in its IPO. The company's set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange any moment now, as we start to see the IPO market just crack open a little bit once again.\n\n05:27 Brooke DePalma\n\nAbsolutely. And what we've learned this past year is when these sort of either data-driven, AI driven or crypto driven stocks debut on the exchange, or debut to the public market, what we've seen is investors really pleased, really excited, and really into these sort of trades. If you take a look at how Circle's performed, it's up more than 510% since it's opened back in June. We also know that CoreWeave, which actually got an upgrade from City today because of the Microsoft cloud computing segment doing really well this past quarter, we also have seen CoreWeave do really well. It's up more than 160% since it's debut. And also worth noting here that Figma's IPO comes after it had abandoned plans to sell itself to Adobe. And so this is certainly one that investors have their eyes on and we'll see if it ends up getting the same returns as previous of this year's IPOs have gotten.\n\n06:41 Speaker A\n\nYeah, I saw the latest indications here for it were for it to open at $65 to $70. The IPO price was $33. Not too shabby for Figma. All right. Thank you so much, Brooke.

Made famous by Warren Buffett, this strategy targets businesses that can sustain strong long-term profitability due to factors like distinct market positions, strong brand loyalty, cost advantages, network effects and regulatory barriers.\n\n\n\nAmong the companies that exemplify wide economic moats are Lam Research Corporation LRCX, Adobe Inc. ADBE, The Walt Disney Company DIS and Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM. These companies compete in industries with significant barriers to entry, which safeguard their market positions and promote consistent revenue growth by reducing the risk of new competitors.\n\n\n\nWide-moat companies typically derive their advantage from factors such as strong brand recognition, network effects, high customer switching costs, regulatory hurdles and economies of scale. These elements create formidable challenges for new or existing rivals attempting to gain market share. Consequently, these firms often benefit from solid pricing power, stable profit margins, and the capacity to reinvest in their businesses, further reinforcing their long-term competitive edge.\n\n\n\nThe attraction of investing in wide-moat businesses stems from their ability to deliver steady, long-term returns. In contrast to companies in highly competitive industries — where profits are more vulnerable to pricing pressure and intense rivalry — wide-moat firms tend to show greater stability during economic downturns and market turbulence. Their solid market positions and robust balance sheets enable them to weather challenges that might severely impact less well-protected competitors.\n\n\n\nInvesting in wide-moat companies provides a solid strategy for building long-term wealth, as these businesses typically produce steady cash flows and deliver shareholder value through dividend payments and stock price growth. While no investment is entirely risk-free, companies with strong economic moats provide a level of durability that many investors seek in an ever-changing market. Our Wide Moat Screen makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks at any given time — just like the ones mentioned above.\n\n\n\nReady to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas? Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Screens and discover your next big opportunity.\n\n4 Wide-Moat Stocks to Buy Now\n\nLam Research benefits from its leadership position in wafer fabrication equipment, specializing in etch and deposition technologies critical to semiconductor manufacturing. Its deep expertise, long-term customer relationships, and the enormous capital requirements of its industry form a powerful competitive moat. Technology inflections in the semiconductor industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration, are expected to continue driving sustainable growth and increasing LRCX’s served market for its products and services in the deposition, etch and clean businesses.\n\n\n\nLam Research has high exposure to the memory segment, which is likely to see tremendous growth in the long run. The semiconductor memory market is being driven by the growing proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Blockchain, cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and Internet of Things. The huge explosion of data as a result of these advanced technologies requires it to be stored, processed and analyzed to increase efficiency and drive the growth of the business. This has been leading to increased demand for memory chips. In addition, increasing adoption of semiconductor components across various industries, including automotive, consumer electronics, and IT & telecom, remains a tailwind.\n\n\n\nLam Research is at the center of the AI revolution, with its advanced fabrication tools playing a crucial role in enabling high-performance computing. Also, with AI applications requiring more efficient and high-speed memory, high-bandwidth memory adoption is accelerating. Additionally, Lam is benefiting from increased complexity in semiconductor manufacturing, where etch and deposition technologies are crucial. These factors position this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock as a key enabler of next-generation AI chips. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n\n\nAdobe maintains dominance in creative software through tools like Photoshop and Illustrator. Its products are deeply embedded in professional workflows, creating high switching costs, while its subscription model ensures recurring revenues.\n\n\n\nAdobe’s tools, like Acrobat AI Assistant and Adobe Express, are attracting business professionals and creators. Acrobat AI Assistant uses conversational interfaces to make it easier for users to read digital documents and gain insights within a short timeframe. Adobe Express utilizes AI to empower consumers to quickly design and publish content through conversational AI in an easy-to-use, all-in-one application. Adobe is integrating these solutions to facilitate a smoother creation-to-consumption process across mobile apps, web browsers and desktop offerings. Adobe’s monthly active users across these categories surpassed more than 700 million users at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nAdobe’s strategy of offering an AI-powered, comprehensive creative platform that extends from idea generation through creation to mass production and delivery is addressing the needs of Creative and Marketing Professionals. Firefly is enhancing the capabilities of Creative Cloud desktop applications. The Firefly App is attracting users for AI-powered content ideation, creation and production, and its support for third-party models, including from Alphabet GOOGL division Google’s Imagen and Veo, Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI’s image generation and Black Forest Labs’ Flux, is a key catalyst. Adobe Firefly App availability on mobile is expected to further boost its popularity.\n\n\n\nAdobe, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, is leveraging Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and native applications to deliver unified and personalized customer experiences. The launch of AEP AI assistant enables teams across the business to interact with data smoothly and efficiently. The innovative solution helps customers leverage their first-party customer data and deliver more relevant, high-impact advertising experiences driven by direct customer relationships.\n\n\n\nDisney benefits from unmatched brand equity, irreplaceable content libraries, and a global media ecosystem that spans streaming, merchandise and theme parks — each reinforcing the other and creating a powerful network effect. Disney has successfully transformed its streaming business from a loss-leader to a profitable growth engine. The business generated $336 million in operating income during second-quarter fiscal 2025, demonstrating sustainable profitability after years of investment. Disney+ added 1.4 million subscribers to reach 126 million total, defying analyst expectations and showcasing platform resilience. This profitability milestone validates Disney's strategic focus on quality content and effective pricing strategies.\n\n\n\nESPN continues reinforcing its position as sports' dominant platform, with fiscal second-quarter delivering its most-watched primetime ever and 32% viewership growth in the key 18-49 demographic. The ESPN streaming service launch in Fall 2025 represents a major revenue catalyst, creating an entirely new revenue stream from Disney's most profitable content. Combined with strategic partnerships like the Disney-Amazon AMZN advertising integration and Disney-ITV content sharing initiative, the company has created sophisticated monetization capabilities that significantly enhance revenue per user. Disney's bundle strategy continues driving higher retention rates while expanding international reach.\n\n\n\nDisney's $60 billion capital investment program over 10 years represents the largest theme park expansion in the company’s history, with multiple projects delivering through the second half of 2025. The company increased its parks’ capital expenditures to $4.3 billion in second-quarter fiscal 2025, targeting 20-25% capacity increases by 2027 with a projected mid-teens return on invested capital.\n\n\n\nMagic Kingdom's largest-ever expansion includes the new Villains Land and Cars-themed Frontierland replacement, both beginning construction in 2025. Monsters, Inc. Land at Hollywood Studios will feature Disney's first suspended coaster, while Animal Kingdom's Tropical Americas adds Indiana Jones and Encanto attractions. These developments address the persistent demand-supply imbalance that has enabled this Zacks Rank #2 stock to maintain premium pricing power.\n\n\n\nYum! Brands benefits from a strong franchise model and global scale. Brand loyalty, supply-chain efficiencies, and broad geographic reach give it an edge over regional competitors. The company’s KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands are global leaders of the chicken, pizza and Mexican-style food categories, respectively.\n\n\n\nYUM! Brands, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, is gaining traction with its next-generation growth initiatives aimed at capturing evolving consumer preferences. YUM’s “easy operations” pillar is focused on streamlining restaurant operations and empowering team members. The company has extended its Byte Restaurant Coach tool to an additional 5,000 stores. This digital platform supports consistent and scalable performance management through routine tools and training.\n\n\n\nTaco Bell U.S. also onboarded 1,500 more restaurants to the Byte Back of House platform, raising the total to 3,000 stores. This progress marks a step forward in developing a fully connected kitchen ecosystem aimed at enhancing efficiency and enabling data-driven operational decisions. YUM plans for full system-wide adoption in 2025.\n\n\n\nYUM! Brands reported steady progress in global development in the first quarter, with 751 store openings across 68 countries. KFC led the development effort, opening 528 units — the second-highest first-quarter total in the brand’s history — driven by strong performance in key markets such as China, India, Japan and Thailand. With a global average payback period of less than five years, and even more attractive returns in China, Thailand and the Middle East, KFC continues to be a cornerstone of YUM's expansion strategy. Meanwhile, Pizza Hut added 198 stores in 34 markets, and Taco Bell posted 24 gross openings. Taco Bell also remains on track to achieve 100 net international openings in 2025, with the strongest momentum in the U.K., Spain and India.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:34:23.885254+00:00"}

IPOs are moments of truth—will public market investors, literally, buy what VCs have been backing for years? It’s also an event that tests how people are thinking about the wider IPO market. Are we, after all this time, so back?\n\nOn Wednesday, Figma, the design software unicorn led by Dylan Field, completed its initial public offering, raising $1.2 billion in proceeds ($1.4 billion if you include the over-allotement) for the company and some of its early shareholders, signaling strong demand for its shares which will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange this morning. Figma seemingly sailed through its investor roadshow, upping its share price from the initial $25 to $28 range to the $33 it ultimately priced at. And after the company’s $20 billion planned merger with Adobe fell apart a year-and-a-half ago, the $19 billion valuation that Figma has fetched in its IPO is a pretty remarkable testament to its potential as a standalone business.\n\nDerek Hernandez, emerging technology senior analyst at PitchBook, says that even compared to successful IPOs of late, Figma is singular, with its year-over-year revenue growth approaching 50%, and its Q1 profitability (Figma’s Q1 net income was $44.9 million).\n\n“Figma stands out even among recent high-growth software IPOs like Circle and CoreWeave,” Hernandez said via email. “Figma has both scale and earnings and is a prime example of a high-growth, VC-backed company with a strong narrative that the market is eager for, positioning it as one of the most credible high-growth listings this year.”\n\nThis is, ultimately, high praise—in June, stablecoin firm Circle was priced at $31 a share, and closed yesterday at about $190, while CoreWeave’s initially muted IPO still has the company up about 150% year-to-date. High praise, of course, also means high expectations. This, perhaps, has long been true of Figma: A look at the company’s SEC filings shows that a staggering four top VC firms have stakes in Figma valued north of $1 billion—Index, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia.\n\nAnd while the fallout from the failed Adobe merger was public, that attempted merger also lingers in the background as a positive signal of sorts, “which served as a massive validation of Figma’s strategic importance and market position,” said Greg Martin, managing director at Rainmaker Securities, via email. Adobe looms in Figma’s past and its future, added Martin, who noted that Figma has both the opportunity and challenge of “overtaking Adobe as the leading design software company, with its cloud-native collaborative platform.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:34:27.652051+00:00"}

GE, ADSK, ADBE and SFM are some such stocks.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/add-4-garp-stocks-portfolio-135500175.html", "published_at": "2025-07-30T13:55:00Z", "source": "Zacks", "text": "If you are looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks offering the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.\n\n\n\nThe strategy helps investors gain exposure to undervalued stocks with impressive prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of value and growth investing. GE Aerospace GE, Autodesk ADSK, Adobe ADBE and Sprouts Farmers Market SFM are some GARP stocks that hold promise.\n\nGARP Metrics: Mix of Growth & Value Metrics\n\nThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.\n\n\n\nGrowth Metrics\n\n\n\nA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.\n\n\n\nAnother metric that growth and GARP investors consider is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for a strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan.\n\n\n\nValue Metrics\n\n\n\nGARP investing prioritizes the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.\n\n\n\nUsing the GARP principle, we ran a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\n\n\nLast 5-year EPS & projected 3-5-year EPS growth rates between 10% and 25% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)\n\n\n\nROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE than the industry average indicates superior stocks.)\n\n\n\nP/E and P/B ratios less than the M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)\n\n\n\nHere are four stocks from the five that made it through the screening process:\n\n\n\nGE Aerospace is a leading designer, developer and producer of jet engines, components and integrated systems for military, commercial and business aircraft. The company is well-known for its aero-derivative gas turbines for marine applications.\n\n\n\nGE Aerospace has been witnessing strength in its businesses, driven by robust demand for commercial engines, propulsion and additive technologies. Rising U.S. & international defense budgets, geopolitical tensions, positive airline & airframer dynamics and robust demand for commercial air travel augur well for the company. Its portfolio-reshaping actions are likely to unlock value for its shareholders. For 2025, GE Aerospace expects organic revenues to grow in the low-double-digit range from the year-ago level.\n\n\n\nThis Zacks Rank #1 stock has surged 62.1% in the year-to-date period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 16.07%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GE’s 2025 earnings has moved north by 6.5% to $5.87 per share over the past 30 days. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\n\n\nAutodesk develops model-based design, engineering and documentation software. The company serves customers in architecture, engineering and construction; product design and manufacturing; and digital media and entertainment industries.\n\n\n\nAutodesk’s performance is gaining from new business growth, steady subscription renewal rates and strong competitive performance. Higher demand for its cloud-based products, mobile solutions and design suites is expected to drive the company’s revenues over the long haul. The rapid adoption of BIM 360 products and the success of the maintenance of the subscription program bode well for the growth of the company. Autodesk’s top-line growth is expected to remain strong, thanks to the demand for its AEC, AutoCAD and manufacturing product families.\n\n\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 stock has returned 3.7% in the year-to-date period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.22%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADSK’s fiscal 2026 earnings has moved north by 0.1% to $9.64 per share over the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nAdobe’s tools, like Acrobat AI Assistant and Adobe Express, are attracting business professionals and creators. Acrobat AI Assistant uses conversational interfaces to make it easier for users to read digital documents and gain insights within a short timeframe. Adobe Express is using AI to enable consumers to quickly design and publish content through conversational AI in an easy-to-use, all-in-one application. Adobe’s monthly active users across these categories surpassed more than 700 million users at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nThe Firefly App is attracting users for AI-powered content ideation, creation and production, and its support for third-party models, including from Alphabet division Google’s Imagen and Veo, Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s image generation and Black Forest Labs’ Flux, is a key catalyst. Adobe Firefly App availability on mobile is expected to further boost its popularity.\n\n\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 stock has declined 16.6% in the year-to-date period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.53%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADBE’s fiscal 2025 earnings has moved north by 0.1% to $20.63 per share over the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nSprouts Farmers Market’s commitment to providing fresh produce and health-oriented products aligns with increasing consumer demand for healthier food options. The overall market for natural and organic food at home, which SFM targets, is estimated to be around $290 billion within the total $1.6 trillion spent on food at home. Its private-label products continue to gain traction, accounting for 24% of total sales, with 300 new items launched last year, fostering customer loyalty.\n\n\n\nSprouts Farmers plans to open at least 35 new stores in 2025, targeting approximately 10% unit growth, supported by a robust pipeline of 120 approved sites and more than 85 signed leases. Embracing a multi-channel approach, Sprouts Farmers continues to adapt to shifting consumer shopping habits. Significant investments in digital infrastructure, online ordering and delivery services have enhanced customer accessibility.\n\n\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 stock has returned 23.5% in the year-to-date period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 16.5%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SFM’s 2025 earnings has remained steady at $5.08 per share over the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nYou can get the remaining stock on this list by signing up now for a 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software.

The software maker priced the Figma IPO at 33, above the expected range of 30 to 32.\n\nThe software maker will trade under the ticker FIG. The Figma IPO has been widely anticipated on Wall Street. The offering values Figma at $19.3 billion.\n\nThe Figma IPO is expected to raise about $1.2 billion as currently priced. Snowflake (SNOW) pulled off the biggest IPO by a software firm, raising $3.4 billion in 2020.\n\nFigma offers cloud-based tools for the collaborative design of websites, apps and other digital products. Federal regulators blocked Adobe's $20 billion bid to acquire Figma in 2023.\n\nFigma IPO To Spark Rebound?\n\nA strong showing by Figma could herald a rebound in the IPO market, said Matthew Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital.\n\n\"A warm reception for the biggest software listing by market cap in over three years would open the door to a lot of pre-IPO companies waiting on the sidelines,\" Kennedy said. \"Arguably just as important, Figma will be the most richly valued enterprise software IPO since the 2021 boom: It will be the first software company since then to go public at over 20 times sales.\"\n\nHe added: \"I think we'll see more high-profile software IPOs like Netskope, Avalara, and SymphonyAI in the near-term. One of the largest private unicorns, Canva, is a direct comparison to Figma, so if the deal does well they'd have a very easy time pricing an IPO.\"\n\nAccording to Renaissance, 122 offerings have been priced in the U.S. so far this year, up 47% year-on-year while 139 offerings have been filed, up nearly 21%.\n\nBig Venture Capital Backers\n\nIn its S-1 filing for the Figma IPO, the software maker said it had $749 million in revenue in 2025, up 48% from a year earlier.\n\nThe software maker said it has 13 million monthly active users and over 11,100 customers that generate more than $10,000 in annual recurring revenue.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Figma noted 91% gross margins and 18% operating margins.\n\nVenture capital backers include Kleiner Perkins, Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital.\n\n\"(The Figma IPO) also is important because VC-backed tech is a key pillar of an active IPO market, and one that's been missing for over three years now,\" Kennedy added.\n\n\"The below-average deal activity since 2022 has coincided with a lack of VC-backed tech deals during the same time. So the return of deals like Figma signals a rebound in the IPO market as a whole.\"\n\nAdobe Stock Falters\n\nMeanwhile, Adobe stock has retreated 15% in 2025.\n\nThe maker of digital media and marketing software posted a modest beat-and-raise report for its fiscal second quarter ended May 30.\n\nAdobe earned an adjusted $5.06 a share, up 13% year over year, on sales of $5.87 billion, up 11%, in fiscal Q2. Wall Street had expected Adobe to earn $4.97 a share on sales of $5.8 billion.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on X, formerly Twitter, @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWant To Trade Options?

The company said today that it is rolling out an image-upscaling feature, an object blending, and an upgraded object remover to Photoshop.\n\nThe company said that the Generative Upscale feature will enhance an image up to 8 megapixels. This is useful for restoring details to old photos, upscaling images for prints, or adopting assets for various platforms.\n\nIn 2024, Adobe teased a feature called Project Perfect Blend, which works on correcting colors, shadows, and lighting for new objects being added to an existing image. The idea is to have the new object, such as a sofa chair in a room, blend in with the environment.\n\nNow Adobe is rolling out this feature under the Harmonize moniker, letting you place an object in a scene, remove its background, and have Photoshop use Firefly models to adjust color, lighting, shadows, and visual tones to fit the object in the scene.\n\nThe company is also rolling out an improved object-removal tool. Previously, when you used generative fill to remove the object, the tool considered the whole scene to fill in the gap of the removed object and at times, that resulted in unwanted artifacts in the image. The company has reworked the algorithm to have it focus on just removing the object and filling the gap with the background.\n\nIn a demo seen by TechCrunch, when Adobe’s director for product management at Photoshop, Joel Baer, used an earlier version of object removal to remove a small bowl of pico de gallo from a picture, the tool just added a green blob. The new version was able to successfully remove the object and replace it with the background.\n\nAdobe is also adding a few small features to Photoshop, including a better way to manage putting assets in a shared and organized space. Plus, the company lets you choose the version of the Firefly model you want to choose while using AI features.\n\n“We have talked to photographers, designers, and content creators to understand what are the pain points in their workflows and what slows them down. These new features will help them save time, remove friction from their workflows, and take on some of the time-consuming tasks on their behalf,” Shambhavi Kadam, senior director of product management for Photoshop, said in a briefing.\n\nThe Generative Upscale, Harmonize, and improved object-removal features are available in beta for Photoshop on desktop and web versions. The Harmonize feature is also available on the new Photoshop iOS app through an early access program.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:34:43.464105+00:00"}

For the design software star, the public offering represents a long and winding path since Adobe's (ADBE 1.37%) $20 billion acquisition of the company was blocked in 2023 over regulatory pushback that the deal would suppress competition in the design software industry.\n\nAfter dealing with the setback and offering severance to workers who wanted to quit, Figma has added new artificial intelligence (AI) features and continued to deliver solid growth. On the eve of its initial public offering (IPO), Figma appears to be as strong as ever.\n\nThe company competes with Adobe in design software, and it may be best known for user interface and user experience (UI/UX) design software, serving companies like Netflix, Uber Technologies, and Alphabet's Google. Figma's singular innovation is that it built design software within web browsers, rather than selling it separately as software, and its web-based applications have helped make its product successful and drive its growth.\n\nAdobe recognized the competition from Figma early on, so it's not a surprise the company tried to buy it. It even made earlier offers to acquire it. After the deal fell through, Adobe remains Figma's biggest, and significantly larger, competitor.\n\nCan Figma compete with Adobe? Let's take a closer look.\n\nFigma is ready for its close-up\n\nTargeting a valuation of $18.8 billion, slightly less than what Adobe offered to buy it for three years ago, Figma's IPO seems very reasonably priced.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company reported $821 million in revenue, giving it a price-to-sales valuation of 23. However, that valuation seems justified as Figma is growing rapidly, and is profitable.\n\nDuring that period, revenue is up 46%, and it reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating margin of 17%. It's also highly profitable at the product level with a gross margin of 91% and net dollar retention of 132%, meaning that existing customers increased their spending on the platform by 32% over the last four quarters.\n\nBy contrast, Adobe is much larger than Figma, with $21.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, but that also works to Figma's advantage as it demonstrates a large market for its service, and room to grow if it can grab market share from Adobe.\n\nFigma estimates its addressable market at $33 billion today, which also gives it plenty of room for growth.\n\nAdobe vs. Figma: Who's the winner?\n\nFigma competes directly with Adobe XD, a product Adobe launched to claw back market share from Figma, but the start-up has generally held its own.\n\nAccording to a survey of comments on platforms like Reddit, designers generally prefer Figma over Adobe XD.\n\nFigma's growth rate shows that it's succeeding by adding both new customers and new products. It now has a suite of tools that covers everything from product ideation to shipping the product. Seventy-six percent of Figma's customers now use at least two products, showing a healthy rate of cross-selling and adoption.\n\nInvestors should expect Figma to continue introducing new products as it expands and evolves, and aims to take market share from Adobe.\n\nIs Figma a buy?\n\nIPOs are notoriously volatile and difficult to predict, but Figma seems to be well positioned for success. Its valuation has already been validated by Adobe, and at an $18.8 billion market cap the pricing looks reasonable. Figma is also growing fast, and is already profitable on a GAAP basis, separating it from a lot of cloud software companies that have been public for years.\n\nIf Figma can continue its pace of product innovation and deliver strong growth, the stock looks like a good bet over the long term.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:34:45.039626+00:00"}

After more than 1,000 companies debuted on the public markets during the exuberance of 2021, the ensuing three years have been comparatively quiet, with 181, 154, and 225 IPOs in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. With approximately half of 2025 in the rearview mirror, we've already seen nearly 200 IPOs, putting the current year on a pace not seen in quite a while.\n\nOne of the most anticipated debuts is from the creative software company Figma, which is expected to go public as early as late July. If that name sounds familiar, it's likely because of the attempted 2022 acquisition by rival Adobe (ADBE 1.37%) that was terminated after antitrust concerns. Let's take a look at both companies to see which is more deserving of investors' capital.\n\nHow we got here\n\nWhen Adobe announced its plan to acquire Figma, much commentary was generated about the move and its associated price tag of $20 billion. To some, it seemed like an expensive but necessary move to bring a rival's software offering under Adobe's suite of products. To others, it was an admission that Adobe was losing ground to newer entrants in the creative software space. In the end, it didn't end up mattering as the deal fell apart and Figma remained private.\n\nSince the merger was terminated in December 2023, Adobe's stock has fallen by 38%. Meanwhile, Figma is seeking an IPO valuation of $13 billion, about $7 billion shy of the price Adobe was willing to pay.\n\nSoftware showdown\n\nFigma offers web-based collaborative design tools that can be used for a variety of design tasks, including creating flyers, mobile app interfaces, and web designs. At its core, Figma offers many of the same tools available to subscribers of Adobe's creative suite of software, including applications like Photoshop and Illustrator.\n\nHowever, the focus should be on how the products differ. Figma is web-based, meaning it will work in a web browser. Adobe's products are applications that need to be downloaded. There is also a substantial collaboration feature offered by Figma that doesn't exist in the Adobe suite.\n\nIt doesn't take a tech genius to see how a product that allows users to easily work on any device that has a web browser while seamlessly collaborating with others would be a compelling challenger to an incumbent like Adobe. That said, there's more to consider before making a bet on this new IPO.\n\nAdobe has a substantial reputational and incumbency advantage. In the professional world and at the enterprise level, the Adobe software suite is substantially entrenched. That's not to say it can't be disrupted, but it's an uphill climb.\n\nAdditionally, both Figma and Adobe are building AI features into their products. Considering the cost of implementing AI, it's worth considering how much of a burden this would have on a smaller company like Figma compared to the deeper-pocketed Adobe.\n\nThe bottom line for investors\n\nThere's a case to be made that a web-based collaborative platform like Figma is perfectly positioned to take share from the entrenched Adobe. In that sense, the excitement around Figma's IPO makes sense. Buying shares of Figma at its expected market cap of $13 billion puts a potentially longer runway for growth in front of the company. By comparison, Adobe's market cap is nearly $158 billion.\n\nHowever, it's likely too early to declare the downfall of Adobe. Its incumbency advantage will be tough to disrupt, and as long as the race for AI continues, those spending requirements favor Adobe and its larger size and strong balance sheet.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:34:52.663258+00:00"}

Earlier in the week, the S&P 500 surpassed 6,300 for the first time.\n\nThe S&P 500 had a remarkable journey this year that saw the index take a major hit in April before making a solid rebound. The index hit a record high in February, driven by optimism that Trump’s pro-business policies would boost the overall market. But shortly after taking office, Trump introduced sweeping tariffs.\n\nConcerns about a potential global trade war triggered a sharp decline in stocks by April, with the index falling as much as 18% for the year and coming close to a bear market. However, the market began to recover once Trump declared a temporary halt on the tariffs and initiated trade talks with U.S. partners.\n\nSince then, there has been no looking back for the index.\n\nInvestor Optimism, Earnings Driving Rally\n\nThe second-quarter earnings season has so far been impressive, with more than one-third of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported their quarterly results, 80% of which have surpassed estimates, according to LSEG data.\n\nFriday’s rally came as Trump geared up to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, with expectations of striking a major trade deal.\n\nLately, deals have also been finalized with Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines before the Aug. 1 tariff deadline. Also, cooling inflation and a shrinking labor market have raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will resume its rate cuts if not in July, but soon. Market participants are hopeful that the Federal Reserve will implement at least two rate cuts, which will further boost the index.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:34:54.700933+00:00"}

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Adobe Inc. ( NASDAQ:ADBE ) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.9%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.9%) = US$324b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$324b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$150b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$237b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$371, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Discounted Cash Flow July 28th 2025\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Adobe as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.167. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Adobe\n\nSWOT Analysis for Adobe\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for ADBE.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Three that I've got my eye on are Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%), Adobe (ADBE 1.37%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%).\n\nAll three of these trade at a hefty discount to the broader market, yet are still quite promising. If you're looking for value in the AI space, this trio is an excellent starting point.\n\nHow do these three fit into AI?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the best-positioned of this trio. It's the primary chip fabricator for some of the leading tech companies, including Nvidia and Apple. Its chip production facilities fabricate chips that its customers have designed, placing TSMC into a neutral position in the AI race.\n\nIt performed phenomenally well over the past few years, with revenue in U.S. dollars rising an astounding 44% in the second quarter, which exceeded expectations. This strength is expected to persist for many years. Management guided at the start of 2025 that it expects its revenue to increase at nearly a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. Taiwan Semi is a key player in AI technology, and it holds an enviable position.\n\nAdobe makes leading graphics design tools that are the industry standard. Whether it's video editing or image creation, Adobe is a top option. However, investors are growing increasingly concerned that generative AI creation technologies could displace Adobe. Image and video creation using generative AI models has come a long way, and has reached a point where it's nearly indistinguishable from what humans create. As a result, many are forecasting the downfall of Adobe.\n\nHowever, I think that's a bit premature. Adobe has also invested heavily in generative AI and has its own Firefly product that allows seamless integration of AI with its existing editing tools. This allows Adobe to compete in this realm while also giving creators more control over the end product than what many generative AI models do. This could keep Adobe relevant within the graphic design industry, making the forecast of its downfall somewhat inaccurate.\n\nCurrently, Adobe is performing well and has posted consistent revenue growth over the past few years.\n\nIf Adobe is supposed to be getting displaced, don't tell it that, as it's still growing at a healthy pace.\n\nLast is Alphabet, the parent company of the Google Search engine. Its stock is running into the same fears as Adobe's, as investors worry that generative AI will replace Google Search. While some have made the switch, investors need to remember that Google is an ingrained habit among internet users around the globe. It would take a massive technological leap, which most users won't need anyway, to get them to switch.\n\nGoogle has already implemented the popular AI search overviews feature, which seamlessly integrates search results and AI, and that could be enough to maintain the vast majority of its dominant market share. If Google Search can maintain most of its market share, the stock is poised to move higher, as it trades at a significant discount to the broader market.\n\nHow cheap is this trio?\n\nAlphabet's stock trades at a deep discount to the broader market, despite strong results.\n\nConsidering that the S&P 500 trades for 23.8 times forward earnings, this seems like a reasonable price to pay for the upside that Alphabet provides.\n\nAdobe is similarly cheap, trading for 18 times forward earnings.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is actually more expensive than the broader market at 25 times forward earnings. However, it's expected to grow at essentially double the pace of the market over the next five years, so this slight premium to the market seems a bit low. As a result, I'm confident labeling Taiwan Semiconductor as a bargain buy right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:35:00.609287+00:00"}

It recently announced a $6 billion investment to set up a new data center in Lancaster, PA, with an initial capacity of 100 megawatts (MW) and a potential to scale up to 300MW. On the other hand, Amazon’s AWS is a structurally dominant force in the cloud space (and is also making aggressive inroads in the AI infra space) and commands a leading share of the cloud market, followed by Microsoft and Google Cloud.\n\nIncreased spending on AI infrastructure benefits both Amazon and CoreWeave, but not equally.

CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. High capex, even with a success-based model, exposes CoreWeave to execution risks if contract revenue does not materialize on time.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:35:06.529261+00:00"}

Spending on Walmart.com grew by 24% from its comparable deal period a year ago, six times faster than Amazon Prime Day’s year-over-year growth, according to credit and debit card transaction data compiled by Bloomberg Second Measure. Walmart’s web traffic increased 14% while Amazon’s was flat, and Walmart’s app use grew by 22% compared with Amazon’s 3%, according to consumer research firm Similarweb.\n\nIn an emailed statement, an Amazon spokesperson said: “These third-party data do not accurately reflect the highly positive customer response to this year’s Prime Day, which saw meaningfully stronger growth and customer engagement than suggested and delivered record-breaking sales and savings that surpassed all previous Prime Day events.”\n\nAmazon still dominates the $1.3 trillion e-commerce market in the US, capturing an estimated 40 cents of every dollar spent online, and Walmart’s online metrics are growing from a smaller base. Amazon’s 403 million web visits during its four-day sale didn’t grow from a year earlier but were still nearly six times those on Walmart for the same period.\n\nBut Walmart’s online momentum shows loyal Amazon shoppers can be lured away with discounts. Second Measure, which gathers data from a panel of 20 million US consumers, captured this phenomenon — showing that 8% of Amazon Prime Day customers also shopped online at Walmart this year, up from 5% in 2024.\n\nCompeting sales give shoppers a greater sense of control during economic uncertainty, encouraging them to spend, said Deborah Weinswig, chief executive officer of Coresight Research in New York. “Shoppers are more willing to do the work and navigate across multiple websites,” she said. “We saw people spending a lot more time browsing and comparing prices.”\n\nAmazon shares gained 1.7% at 11:15 a.m. in New York.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:35:08.351706+00:00"}

Ongoing litigation includes Disney and Universal suing image generation tool Midjourney, the New York Times squaring up against ChatGPT owner OpenAI and Microsoft, and the Wall Street Journal and New York Post versus AI startup Perplexity.\n\nEly Greenfield, chief technology officer at software maker Adobe’s digital media business, has spent over two years pitching a different path. Ever since the debut of a text-to-image model known as Firefly in March 2023, Adobe has touted the company’s own creative generative AI models that are only trained on content that it has rights to use, including Adobe Stock photos and licensed artistic content.\n\nFirefly’s models have been integrated in Adobe’s suite of apps including Photoshop and Illustrator, and thus far, businesses and individual creators have generated over 26 billion assets. Big names including toy maker Mattel and cosmetics manufacturer Estée Lauder have signed on to Firefly for creative ideation, editing, and asset generation purposes.\n\n“Every piece of content that we train on is something that we have acquired the license of, or that is published under a verifiable and known license,” says Greenfield.\n\nThis approach does come with some limitations. If Firefly were asked to generate an image of a Disney cartoon character, like say Mickey Mouse, “it would do a horrible job of it,” concedes Greenfield. “And that’s by design and on purpose.”\n\nGreenfield says that AI tools based on every image found on the internet produce less desired outputs, not just for potentially infringing on IP, but because it is representative of a vast trove of data that doesn’t always have the best quality. “There’s the raw science of how you build the model, but a massive amount of work goes into data curation and preparation,” says Greenfield. “The average piece of content on the internet isn’t necessarily what you want to put in your ad.”\n\nAdobe’s buttoned-up AI approach means the company’s off-the-shelf Firefly offering would have little use to a consumer-facing company like Coca-Cola. But under an enterprise licensing agreement, Adobe says it can train a private version of Firefly that’s exclusively trained on the beverage company’s branding and style.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:35:14.082380+00:00"}

Figma and some of its backers are seeking to raise as much as $1.03 billion in the listing.\n\nThough numerous tech companies including DoorDash Inc. and Airbnb Inc. deployed the approach in their debuts during the Covid era, capitalizing on the frenzied dealmaking that drove IPO volume to record highs, it fell out of favor as the market slowed. Its re-emergence may be a sign that the US IPO market is heating up once again.\n\n“Figma wants to show that it is a hot deal and encourage the right investors to pay up for it, and right now they are the only game in town,” said David Erickson, adjunct professor of business at Columbia Business School and a former co-head of global equity capital markets at Barclays Plc.\n\nInvestors seeking to participate in typical IPOs submit market orders, which are settled at the best available price. For hot tech IPOs like Figma’s, some investors submit jumbo orders with no specific price limit, in the hope of getting a large allocation. Such tactics can inflate the apparent level of demand for shares, potentially making it harder for bankers to settle on an offering price.\n\nFigma’s approach of requiring limit orders is designed to give the company more granular information on what investors believe the stock is worth, the person said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.\n\nThe design software firm’s IPO is expected to price on July 30, Bloomberg News has reported.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this software maker have returned -3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Adobe belongs, has gained 7.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAdobe is expected to post earnings of $5.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.27 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Adobe is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:35:24.338628+00:00"}

After its $20 billion acquisition deal with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) collapsed last year under regulatory pressure, the collaborative design platform is now heading for a public debut. In a fresh SEC filing, Figma laid out plans to raise up to $1.03 billion in its U.S. IPO, with a valuation that could reach $13.6 billion. The offering includes 12.47 million new shares priced between $25 and $28, while existing shareholders are offloading another 24.46 million. If priced at the top of the range, it could mark one of the biggest tech IPOs of the year.\n\nFigma lands in a market that's cautiously waking up. April's tariff shock briefly knocked the wind out of IPO activity, but momentum is building again. Recent filings from Circle Internet Group, CoreWeave, NIQ Global Intelligence, and McGraw Hill suggest investor appetite is resurfacingparticularly in the software and AI-adjacent space. Figma now has the chance to ride that wave. Its public debut will be a key litmus test not just for design startups, but for the broader tech sector's ability to find fresh capital after a year of stifled listings.\n\nMeanwhile, Adobe, which paid a $1 billion breakup fee to walk away from the Figma acquisition, hasn't had an easy year. The stock is down 18% in 2024, with investors jittery about the intensifying battle in AI-driven creative tools. In contrast, the broader software ETF index is up around 11% year-to-date.

Acrobat AI Assistant uses conversational interfaces to make it easier for users to read digital documents and gain insights within a short timeframe. Adobe Express is using AI to enable consumers to quickly design and publish content through conversational AI in an easy-to-use, all-in-one application.

Adobe’s monthly active users across these categories surpassed more than 700 million users at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nAdobe’s strategy of offering an AI-powered, comprehensive creative platform that extends from idea generation through creation to mass production and delivery is addressing the needs of Creative and Marketing Professionals. Firefly is enhancing the capabilities of Creative Cloud desktop applications. The Firefly App is attracting users for AI-powered content ideation, creation and production, and its support for third-party models, including from Alphabet division Google’s Imagen and Veo, Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s image generation and Black Forest Labs’ Flux, is a key catalyst. Adobe Firefly App availability on mobile is expected to further boost its popularity.\n\n\n\nAdobe is leveraging Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and native applications to deliver unified and personalized customer experiences.

The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $645-$930. This indicates a maximum upside of 71.5% and no downside.\n\nOkta Inc.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Okta operates as an identity partner in the United States and internationally.

While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Unfortunately the Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) share price slid 34% over twelve months. That's well below the market return of 16%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 6.7% in the last three years.\n\nSince shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring the unfortunate twelve months during which the Adobe share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 40%. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.\n\nIt's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.\n\nAdobe's revenue is actually up 11% over the last year. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.\n\nThe company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Earnings and Revenue Growth July 21st 2025\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year.

Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 3% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

Additionally, consumer preferences show a notable increase in alcohol gifting, while value-driven purchasing decisions are rising, as individuals seek brands aligned with their personal values.\n\nIn other trading, Indointernet was a standout up 24.9% and ending the day at IDR4,810.00.\n\nBest E-Commerce Stocks\n\nAdobe closed at $361.77 down 0.7%.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding finished trading at $115.73 down 1.1%.\n\nAmazon.com closed at $223.19 down 1.4%.

(NASDAQ:ADBE). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$421 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$340. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Adobe's current trading price of US$364 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Adobe’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhat Is Adobe Worth?\n\nGood news, investors! Adobe is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $558.32, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Adobe’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Adobe\n\nWhat kind of growth will Adobe generate?\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Earnings and Revenue Growth July 16th 2025\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 27% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Adobe. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since ADBE is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADBE for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ADBE. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:35:59.878986+00:00"}

Adobe, a leader in digital media, marketing, and creative solutions, has a proven track record of innovation and consistent value creation. The company's financial strengths include high gross margins, an impressive ROIC of 25.4%, and a low capex/sales ratio. However, it also has some concerns, such as high goodwill and intangibles at 44.9% of assets, significant stock-based compensation of 8.8% of revenue, and low insider ownership at 0.17%.\n\nIn contrast, ServiceNow, a rising star in cloud-based IT service management, has rapid growth and a strong balance sheet. However, it also has some weaknesses, including low insider ownership at 0.16%, a notable increase in shares outstanding by 21.8% in recent years, and very high stock-based compensation of 15.9% of revenue. Adobe's Investment Readiness Score of 81.6 edges out ServiceNow's 72.9, reflecting a stronger overall profile despite its challenges.\n\nThe market reality check reveals that Adobe's FCF yield of 5.87% is attractive compared to the 10-year U.S. bond yield of 4.2%, suggesting potential undervaluation. ServiceNow's FCF yield of 1.7% indicates a lower yield and significant overvaluation. Adobe's stability and growth potential make it a winner in this showdown, earning a place on the watchlist for a deep-dive exploration. ServiceNow, on the other hand, is removed from the watchlist due to its score falling below the 80-point threshold.\n\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Adobe Inc. by jackandjillonthehill on Value Investing Subreddit Page in May 2025, which highlighted the company's dominant position, high-margin software, and strong business fundamentals, including operating margins of 36% and free cash flow margins north of 40%. The company's stock price has depreciated by 2.02% since our coverage. Compound & Fire emphasizes Adobe's fair valuation, strong cash flows, and growth opportunities in AI and digital content and shares a similar view, on Adobe's financial strengths, including high gross margins and an impressive ROIC of 25.4%, but also notes concerns such as high goodwill and intangibles.\n\nAdobe Inc. is on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

This upgraded outlook implies nearly 12% year-over-year growth.\n\n\n\nThe company’s optimism is driven by momentum across its Digital Media and Digital Experience segments. The continued adoption of AI-powered tools, such as Firefly, Acrobat AI Assistant, and GenStudio, is enhancing product value, driving deeper user engagement, and expanding Adobe’s recurring revenue base, resulting in a 12% year-over-year increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in the fiscal second quarter.\n\n\n\nAdobe’s confidence is driven by strong financial discipline. The company generated $2.19 billion in operating cash flow and reported $19.69 billion in remaining performance obligations, with 67% expected to be recognized within a year. These metrics provide a strong foundation to continue investing in innovation while supporting profitability.\n\n\n\nAdobe’s disciplined execution, deepening AI adoption and reliable recurring revenue base position the company well to achieve or even beat its 2025 earnings goal.\n\nADBE Faces Competition From Key Rivals\n\nAutodesk’s ADSK core strength lies in its specialized 3D design tools like AutoCAD and Maya, serving the architecture, engineering and manufacturing sectors. Autodesk's robust cloud-based platforms, including BIM 360 and Fusion Lifecycle, support strong subscription growth. With rising demand for CAD and AEC solutions, Autodesk is well-positioned for sustained revenue expansion, though its premium pricing limits mass-market appeal compared to Adobe’s broader, more accessible creative suite.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft's MSFT competitive edge over Adobe lies in its dominance across cloud infrastructure and AI-powered productivity tools.

According to a post-Prime Day analysis by Adobe Analytics, GenAI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 3,300% year-over-year — which was more than the firm had originally forecast.\n\nAdobe’s e-commerce division provided an analysis of the U.S. retail landscape encompassing over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, including 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories. During the Amazon Prime Day event (July 8-11), U.S. retailers saw $24.1 billion in online spend, representing 30.3% year-over-year growth, or the equivalent of two Black Fridays. (Black Friday 2024 saw $10.8 billion in online spend, which was then a new benchmark for the holiday shopping event.)\n\nThe actual results from the firm’s Prime Day analysis came in slightly higher than its estimates, which predicted $23.8 billion would be spent with U.S. e-commerce retailers over the four-day period, representing 28.4% year-over-year growth.\n\nAs a result, the figures for the use of GenAI driving online shopping were higher as well, indicating increased consumer interest in using generative AI-powered chat services and browsers as online shopping assistants. However, this AI-driven traffic still remains much smaller than other channels like email or paid search, Adobe noted.\n\nPaid search, for example, accounted for a 28.5% share of U.S. e-commerce sales during the Prime Day event, up 5.6% year-over-year.\n\nAnother growing channel for driving retail clicks this year involved social media influencers, who drove 19.9% of U.S. online retail sales during the event. That figure was up 15% year-over-year, and data indicated that influencers converted shoppers into making purchases 10 times more effectively than social media overall.\n\nAmazon didn’t share specific Prime Day figures, only saying that it was the biggest event ever with record sales and more items sold than before. However, the company also expanded Prime Day to a four-day event this year, making comparisons to prior years difficult.\n\nAccording to one third-party analysis from Momentum Commerce, reported by Adweek, Prime Day sales during its first two days were initially down 35% year-over-year, then increased by day three to be up 165% year-over-year. This suggests that shoppers may have been waiting until the later sale days to see if their items would receive deeper discounts.\n\nAdobe noted that top categories driving U.S. e-commerce sales during the Prime Day event this year included appliances, where online sales were up 112%, compared to average daily sales in June. Other categories that saw strong growth included office supplies (up 105%), electronics (up 95%), books (up 81%), tools and home improvement (up 76%), home and garden (up 58%), and baby and toddler (up 55%).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:36:05.796404+00:00"}

Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and other major retailers have started to stage sales around Prime Day, and those promotions helped more than double the $10.8 billion in online sales merchants did last Black Friday, Adobe said.\n\n\n\nRetailers have described consumers as reluctant to make big purchases, but the sale managed to reverse some of that hesitancy, Adobe said. “Strong discounts during the Prime Day event drove many shoppers to ‘trade up’ to higher-ticket items,\" its analysis said.

But, he argues, “investors would turn more positive if Apple could acquire or invest a meaningful stake in an established AI provider.”\n\nApple shares have fallen 16% this year while traders bid up the shares of peers like Meta Platforms Inc., which is spending lavishly on AI. While Apple faces other problems, including its exposure to tariffs and regulatory issues, disappointment in bringing compelling AI features to its vast ecosystem of devices has become top of mind for investors.\n\nApple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The stock fell 1.3% on Monday.\n\nThe company has long shunned acquisitions in favor of building its own products. The largest acquisition in Apple’s history was a $3 billion deal for headphone maker Beats more than a decade ago.\n\nThere are signs that Apple may be warming up to such a move. Bloomberg News reported last month that executives have held internal talks about making an offer for AI startup Perplexity AI, which would add talent and help Apple develop an AI-based search engine. The startup recently completed an investment round that valued it at $14 billion.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush who is a long-time Apple bull, called buying Perplexity a “no brainer,” and said even if Apple paid $30 billion, that sum would be “a drop in the bucket relative to the monetization opportunity Apple can achieve on AI.”\n\nSince unveiling its AI vision more than a year ago, Apple’s roll outs of new features have underwhelmed, such as those unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference last month. The company has reportedly considered using AI tech from outside companies, rather than in-house models, to power a new version of its Siri digital assistant.\n\nKevin Cook, a senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, wants Apple to be more like Meta when it comes to hiring AI experts but stops short of calling for more dramatic changes, saying that concerns about its AI shortfalls are overblown.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:36:09.181587+00:00"}

After declining 7.2% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.\n\nWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.\n\nRSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.\n\nTechnically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.\n\nSo, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefiting from the inevitable rebound.\n\nHowever, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.\n\nWhy a Trend Reversal is Due for ADBE\n\nThe heavy selling of ADBE shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 28.07. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.\n\nThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ADBE has increased 2%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.\n\nMoreover, ADBE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

(ADBE) to ‘Neutral’ Rating; Lowers Price Target from $420 to $280\n\nFor Q2 FY25, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported revenue of $5.87 billion, a YoY increase of 11%. Meanwhile, its GAAP EPS grew by 13% to $3.94 per share. Furthermore, the company’s Digital Media segment achieved an ARR of 12.1% ($18.09 billion), contributing to record Q2 operating cash flow of $2.19 billion.\n\nDespite strong Q2 results, Redburn Rothschild reduced its price target for Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) from $420 to $280, downgrading it to a ‘Neutral’ rating. This downgrade, which occurred on July 2, 2025, is attributed to the much-anticipated IPO of Figma, which filed an update regarding its IPO offering on July 1, 2025. According to the official announcement, the rival firm has filed a registration on Form S-1 with the U.S. SEC for the proposed IPO of its Class A common stock. This potential IPO of Figma raises concerns around Adobe’s competitive position in the market, particularly after its failed $20 billion acquisition of Figma in 2023.\n\nNevertheless, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is progressing well and is already ahead of its $250 million AI revenue goal for FY25, thanks to its Firefly and Acrobat AI Assistant tools. Moreover, its full-year guidance remains the same, indicating FY25 EPS of $20.50-$20.70.\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) offers Digital Media and Digital Experience platforms, delivering creative, document, and experience-based solutions to creators, marketers, and enterprises globally.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Find out the best perks and a few hidden benefits that come with being an Amazon Prime member.\n\nAmazon stretched out its annual Prime Day sales event so that it lasted four days – twice as long as in the past – and, as a result, blew away previous sales figures.\n\nThe online retailing powerhouse – and tech giant – said Prime Day 2025, which ran from July 8-11, was its biggest ever, the company announced Saturday, July 12, in a news release.\n\nAmazon's 11th Prime Day drove record sales and a record number of items sold, larger than any previous four-day period that included a Prime Day event, the company said. (The promotion became a two-day affair in 2019; this year, Amazon expanded it to four days for the first time.)\n\nU.S. online spending during Prime Day's four days amounted to an estimated $24.1 billion, according to Adobe. Its Adobe Analytics sales data tracks online transactions across U.S. retail sites. The data, which is aggregated and anonymized, doesn't directly track Amazon's sales but does reflect overall spending and suggest Prime Day demand.\n\nHow did Amazon Prime Day 2025 compare to Black Friday 2024?\n\nSpending for Prime Day amounted to \"more than two Black Fridays – which drove $10.8 billion in online spending during the 2024 holiday shopping season – and sets a new benchmark for the summer shopping season,\" Adobe said in a news release. The total also surpassed Adobe's pre-Prime Day estimate of $23.8 billion in sales.\n\n\"This year’s extended Prime Day event delivered incredible savings to our members across millions of deals,\" said Doug Herrington, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Stores, in a news release. \"We're thrilled to see record savings for our customers, who found great prices on the everyday essentials and products they love.\"\n\nShopping: Here are the best still-live Amazon Prime Day deals you can buy today\n\nHerrington also saluted Amazon's employees, saying, \"Their efforts made this our biggest Prime Day yet, and I'm grateful for their contributions.\"\n\nIndependent sellers, including small and medium-sized businesses, also racked up record sales and a record number of items sold, according to Amazon.\n\n\"We saw impressive sales not just on our Prime exclusive deals but across our entire catalog,\" said Anne Maza, co-owner of the small business Olivia Garden, in a statement. \"Beyond the immediate revenue boost, we're especially thrilled about the increased brand awareness and the acquisition of new customers through the event.”\n\nA majority of shoppers (53.2%) made purchases on mobile devices, compared to on desktop computers, accounting for $12.8 billion of the spending, according to Adobe.\n\nThe sales racked up despite economic uncertainties driven by President Donald Trump's tariff strategy and flagging consumer confidence.\n\nAmazon Prime Day: What people bought\n\nAmong the products consumers snatched up during the Prime Day period, according to Adobe:\n\nKids’ apparel (up 250%, compared to average daily sales in June 2025)\n\n(up 250%, compared to average daily sales in June 2025) Home security products (+185%)\n\n(+185%) School supplies (+175%)\n\n(+175%) Refrigerators & freezers (+160%)\n\n(+160%) Games (+160%)\n\n(+160%) Headphones & speakers (+155%)\n\n(+155%) Car seats (+145%)\n\n(+145%) Luggage (+145%)\n\n(+145%) Vacuum cleaners (+140%)\n\n(+140%) Power tools (+135%)\n\n(+135%) Computers (+125%)\n\n(+125%) Smartphone accessories (+120%)\n\n(+120%) Storage furniture (+120%)\n\n(+120%) Televisions (+90%)\n\n(+90%) Small kitchen appliances (+90%)\n\n(+90%) Dorm essentials (+84%)\n\n(+84%) Exercise equipment (+80%)\n\nContributing: Paul Davidson and Betty Lin-Fisher, USA TODAY\n\nMike Snider is a reporter on USA TODAY’s Trending team.

Its annual recurring revenue doubled to about $7 million in a week, founder Roy Lee told TechCrunch. Lee also said he isn’t worried about rivals, nor cheating detectors.\n\nInsights from Brex: If your company is struggling to procure the right AI tools, you’re not alone, and you may find it interesting to know how corporate credit card company Brex has embraced the “messiness.”\n\nNew stripes: Stripe’s first employee, Darragh Buckley, who went on to found fintech startup Increase, has seemingly succeeded in achieving his long-rumored goal to buy a bank; but his interests are not what his competitors think, he told TechCrunch.\n\nMost interesting VC and funding news this week\n\nImage Credits:Revolut\n\nSeveral interesting deals and new funds were announced in the last couple of weeks — and there are more to come.\n\nIn talks: Revolut is reportedly seeking a new funding round at a $65 billion valuation; SpaceX is looking to raise $250 million at a $400 billion valuation; and Lovable is on track to raise $150 million at a $2 billion valuation.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Adobe Systems (ADBE) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this software maker a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Adobe is 14%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 12% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.9%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Adobe is 11.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9.4%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.5%.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:36:23.747212+00:00"}

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) we really liked what we saw.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Adobe is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.44 = US$8.3b ÷ (US$28b - US$9.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2025).\n\nSo, Adobe has an ROCE of 44%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.7% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Adobe\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Return on Capital Employed July 9th 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Adobe compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Adobe for free.\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nAdobe's ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 89% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Adobe has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And since the stock has fallen 12% over the last five years, there might be an opportunity here. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.\n\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

While there are a few stocks that I'd agree probably aren't the best buys right now, there are others that look like excellent investments.\n\nTwo phenomenal stock bargains that I think are worth buying right now are Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) and Adobe (ADBE 1.37%). Both are significantly undervalued compared to their historical averages, making them solid bargains from a historical perspective. However, investors need to know the reasons for these stocks being so cheap.\n\nBoth stocks have generative AI challenges\n\nAlphabet and Adobe are at the top of the world in their respective industries. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, which dominates the search engine market, and Adobe has the industry-standard graphics design tools. However, the problem some investors see with these two is that their primary market is directly in the crosshairs of industries that generative AI can transform.\n\nFor the search side, generative AI can aggregate results and relay information in one prompt. This eliminates some steps from a traditional search, but it can omit the source of the information. Generative AI models can also create images and videos with a simple prompt rather than requiring a human to design them from scratch. While you'd still need a human to input information to create these models, generative AI can dramatically speed up the creation process, so you wouldn't need nearly as many digital media specialists to perform the work.\n\nThe bear case for both companies is that generative AI completely upends their business models, resulting in revenue and profit declines. The market priced in their failure to some extent, but I believe that's in error.\n\nFor Alphabet, the Google Search engine isn't going anywhere. Google is how the vast majority of people navigate the internet, and the AI-powered search overview feature seamlessly integrates generative AI with traditional search. This will likely be sufficient for most users, maintaining Google's dominant position. While there will be some defectors, this hasn't surfaced in Google's results. In Q1, Google Search revenue rose by 10% year over year, signaling that this giant isn't going anywhere.\n\nFor Adobe, generative AI is a real threat. However, it has countered with its own generative AI product: Firefly. Firefly integrates with Adobe's existing product lineup, giving creators full control over their end product. It has also partnered with nearly every major player in the generative AI world, which suggests that Adobe's Firefly model is superior to what it can offer; otherwise, there would be no reason to partner with it. Adobe has pivoted into the generative AI space and is a leader in the industry. Although its business may not resemble what it was a couple of years ago, it remains a force to be reckoned with.\n\nAlphabet and Adobe have made the pivot into generative AI, yet the market hasn't fully come to terms with these two. This presents a prime opportunity for investors to capitalize on and acquire the stocks on sale as they trade at a significant discount to the market.\n\nAlphabet and Adobe look cheap compared to the broader market\n\nAs a baseline, I'll be using the S&P 500 for comparing valuations. The S&P 500 trades at 23.2 times forward earnings at the time of writing, and both stocks are substantially cheaper than that.\n\nBoth stocks trade in the mid-18 times forward earnings range, which is a significant discount to the broader market. Furthermore, most of the big tech companies trade from the high 20s to the low 30s times forward earnings, so it's a huge discount to their big tech peers.\n\nAs both companies showcased an ability to grow earnings at an above-market-average pace and are trading at a lower price tag than the market. the stocks look like phenomenal bargains to scoop up now. But you'll have to be patient, as the market will only realize these two aren't being disrupted through years of strong earnings reports.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:36:36.139979+00:00"}

Adobe’s data shows that it expects to see a 3,200 percent increase in generative AI-based traffic year on year during Amazon’s summer Prime Day event, which will run until Friday.\n\nThe company’s prediction follows increased use of generative AI for the 2024 holiday season; last year, during the season, traffic brought about by generative AI increased by 1,300 percent compared with holiday 2023.\n\nAdobe noted that while generative AI is rapidly gaining market share, the traffic it creates is still well behind tried-and-true sources like paid search and email.\n\nAccording to the data, more than half of Americans said they use generative AI to research products, while 47 percent of consumers in the U.S. use the technology for product recommendations. Other key functions included finding deals (43 percent), gifting inspiration (35 percent) and writing shopping lists (33 percent).\n\nA slew of companies, including Amazon itself, have invested in generative AI shopping assistant features on their own sites. The e-tail behemoth’s prominently displayed chatbot, Rufus, helps Amazon customers with product-specific questions, searches based on characteristics of a product and information distilled from reviews and product descriptions.\n\nBut retailers are far from the only way—and likely not the primary way—that shoppers are getting their generative AI fix. Earlier this year, OpenAI announced it had created a ChatGPT feature specifically for shopping inquiries. It allows consumers to set specific parameters for products they’re interested in—price, occasion, size, color and more—then helps them hunt down goods that match that criteria. Other technology companies, like Google, have also upgraded their AI-based features to include shopping tools.\n\nThat kind of movement is creating an influx of traffic that can be difficult for brands and retailers to trace, because the generative AI tools are querying the site on the consumer’s behalf. So, while a consumer may see a specific product come up in their ChatGPT shopping inquiry, if they choose not to purchase it, they may never click into a brand or retailer’s site, which marks somewhat of a departure from traditional search and e-commerce.\n\nThe trend of AI-assisted shopping is likely to continue through the end of the year; Salesforce projects that AI will influence $260 billion worth of online sales and $1.6 trillion in in-store sales for this year’s holiday season. Already, four in 10 U.S. shoppers use a large language model (LLM) during the course of their shopping journey, with 5 percent of U.S. adults starting their product discovery with such a tool.\n\nAdobe expects that during Prime Day, U.S. retailers will offer the greatest discount on apparel items, at 24 percent; data from market research company Numerator shows that one-third of Tuesday Prime Day shoppers said they purchased an apparel item, making it the top category for the day, as of 4 p.m.\n\nPer Numerator, despite 95 percent of Prime Day shoppers saying they felt satisfied with the deals Amazon offered, half of all consumers indicated they compared prices at other retailers, a task which AI is adept at helping with. About four in 10 shoppers also plan to shop at Target Circle Week, running simultaneously, and 44 percent of shoppers plan to shop Walmart Deals this week.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:36:37.809888+00:00"}

Amazon’s annual sale, which this year spans four days (July 8-11), is predicted to drive $23.8 billion in online spending across U.S. e-commerce retailers, as other businesses run their own competing sales alongside the popular shopping event.\n\nAdobe, whose e-commerce division regularly releases estimates for online shopping events like Black Friday and others, offers a view into online commerce by tracking transactions online. The firm’s analysis encompasses over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, including 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories.\n\nThis year, Adobe forecasts that Prime Day will be the equivalent of “two Black Fridays.” The $23.8 billion spent over the four-day period will represent 28.4% year-over-year growth and $9.6 billion more than the comparable period last year.\n\nMobile will be a large part of that equation, accounting for more than half (52.5%) of sales, but this year, generative AI will also play a role.\n\nDuring the Prime Day event, Adobe estimates that traffic from generative AI sources will increase 3,200% year-over-year. This is still a much smaller source than other channels, like paid search and email, but Adobe believes it will continue to grow as consumers see the value in using AI for shopping.\n\nThe company noted that GenAI-powered chatbots and browsers saw an initial surge in use during the 2024 holiday season, when traffic from those sources jumped 1,300% compared with the prior year from November 1 through December 31, 2024.\n\nThe company also cited a survey of 5,000 U.S. consumers, which indicated that people were using GenAI for research (55% of respondents), product recommendations (47%), finding deals (43%), getting gift ideas (35%), finding unique products (35%), and creating shopping lists (33%).\n\nOf those who used GenAI, 92% said it enhanced their purchase experience, and 87% said they are more likely to use AI for larger or more complex purchases.\n\nAI providers have been capitalizing on this trend by integrating AI into shopping, as Google has with Gemini-enhanced product search and as OpenAI has with the addition of shopping features in ChatGPT, for example.\n\nAdobe’s forecast says that consumers this Prime Day will be focused on discounts, with apparel having the biggest deals.

The ultimate shopping showdown is underway.\n\nAmazon's (AMZN) Prime Day deals will take center stage for most shoppers this week as the company extends its signature shopping period to four days. But this year, as in recent years, Amazon is not alone.\n\nWalmart (WMT), which showed a profit in its US e-commerce business for the first time this year, is on Amazon's tail as it doubles down on its e-commerce business, entices customers to join its Walmart + membership subscription, and leans into its strength — groceries.\n\nAmazon is \"clearly the big player this week,\" Mizuho analyst David Bellinger said. But, he added, others are in on the fun. That list includes Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), Lowe's, (LOW), Best Buy (BBY), Tractor Supply (TSCO), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), and even Ulta Beauty (ULTA) — all of which are running deals online as well as some in-store promotions.\n\nFront and center, Amazon's biggest threat: Walmart, with its Deals week that runs for six days and is open to all customers, not just members.\n\nAmazon's Prime Day event kicked off on Tuesday and is set to run through July 11 for members only. What started out as a single-day event back in 2015 is now 96 hours — double last year's Prime-a-thon.

In its fiscal 2025 report, Walmart brought in $121 billion in e-commerce sales, boosted by 8.3 billion items delivered the same or next day. Amazon trumps that in comparison with $247.03 billion in net sales for its online stores alone.\n\nIts rival's overwhelming lead aside, Walmart might gain ground thanks to the consumer climate. Consumers remain cautious — US retail sales for May fell 0.9%, a sharper drop than economists had forecast. That means shoppers this week will seek out the best deals no matter what membership they hold.\n\n\"Amazon's probably your first choice to search for stuff, but then you price compare,\" Bellinger said. That could be hurting Amazon, as spending is reportedly down 14% in the first four hours of the first day.\n\n\"Amazon's ... like the king of this week ... then everyone gets a 'drafting off of them' benefit,\" he added.\n\nConsumers will turn to discretionary items this week, such as household essentials, personal electronics, and back-to-school items, per the software analytics platform Adobe.

Amazon stock was lower, however.\n\nThe technology giant is promising millions of discounts on products across its e-commerce platform starting July 8 and ending July 11, double the duration of last year's Amazon Prime Day. Americans will spend $23.8 billion across the four days, according to projections published Monday by Adobe.\n\nThat would mark a 24% increase from the comparable period last year. The projections are based more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retailers, Adobe said. Retail competitors such as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have for several years offered competing July discount days.\n\nThe extended Prime Day comes as Americans are grappling with concerns about tariffs and the broader economy. Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy told CNBC last week that he expects shoppers with be excited about the longer discount window, \"especially at this time, where people are still a little worried about what's going to happen with trade and continuing to have lower prices.\"\n\nBut the longer time frame could be contributing to a slow start. Prime Day sales were down almost 14% in the first four hours of the event compared with the start of last year's sale for Amazon, according to data from Momentum Commerce that was reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe data could be weighing on Amazon stock. Shares were down 1.2% at 220.73 in recent action on the stock market today.\n\nBiggest Amazon Prime Day Deals\n\nMeanwhile, Adobe is forecasting that U.S. retailers will offer discounts most commonly between 10% and 24%. Adobe expects apparel to see the biggest discounts, followed by electronics, televisions, appliances and toys.\n\nAbout 52.5% of shopping will take place on a mobile device, per Adobe's forecast, a record high as app-based platforms benefit from what the analysts called \"impulse shopping.\"\n\nAnother factor to watch: generative AI powered shopping. Amazon last year launched an AI chatbot called Rufus that helps answer questions and direct shoppers toward products. As more shoppers and retailers test the technology, Adobe expects significant growth for sales driven by AI, after noticing the first \"material surge\" in such shopper behavior during last year's holiday shopping season.\n\nIncreased Competition\n\nAmazon rivals are also launching deals event this week. The Walmart Deals event is promising six days of discounts, also starting Tuesday. Target's Circle Week launched on Sunday.\n\nStill, analysts with eMarketer project that Amazon will capture more than 75% of the $17.2 billion that U.S. shoppers spend online during the four-day extended Prime Day event. That's up from about 60% of total U.S. e-commerce sales during last year's two-day event.\n\n\"With the extended time frame, Amazon will recapture demand that spilled over to competitors from shoppers who missed out on its deals,\" eMarketer analyst Sky Canaves wrote in a June research report.\n\nWhat Prime Day Means For Amazon Stock\n\nAnalysts with Bank of America project Amazon could ring up $21 billion in total sales over the four days, up 60% from last year's estimates. That includes $11.5 billion in direct sales for Amazon and $10 billion for third-party sellers that use the platform.\n\nTo BofA Securities analyst Justin Post, the extended deals window is a positive sign for the state of Amazon's e-commerce operations.\n\n\"Extending the savings window suggests that Amazon has greater retail logistics capacity to offer promotions, and that inventory availability is not a constraint, despite tariff concerns,\" Post wrote to clients last week.\n\nPost rates Amazon stock a buy with a price objective of 248. One risk to watch, Post added, is that a longer Prime Day window could weigh on third-quarter margins.\n\nShares of the tech giant are ahead roughly 2% year-to-date. Shares have bounced back from a steep spring slump after the U.S. eased tariffs on Chinese goods.

Adobe predicts the four-day shopping spree will equal the combined online spending of two Black Fridays.\n\n\n\nU.S. online sales are expected to soar to a record $23.8 billion during Amazon’s four-day Prime Day sales event, according to Adobe. The surge in spending marks a 28.4% year-over-year increase, as consumers hunt for deep discounts on back-to-school essentials, from clothing and electronics to backpacks and college gear. The four-day spending over the event is expected to be equivalent to two Black Fridays, in terms of online spending (read: 5 ETF Predictions for the Second Half of 2025).\n\n\n\nInvestors can tap the opportune moment with ETFs having a double-digit allocation to this online behemoth. These include ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN, Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS, Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY and VanEck Vectors Retail ETF RTH.\n\nNew Tactics: Deal Drops & Mobile Spending\n\nThe e-commerce technology giant has been promising millions of discounts on products across its e-commerce platform during the four-day event. It has introduced daily deal drops (limited-time offers) that encourage consumers to check back frequently.\n\n\n\nMobile shopping is expected to play a central role, with purchases from smartphones and tablets projected to reach $12.5 billion, or 52.5% of total sales. Adobe noted that mobile users tend to make more impulse purchases, making this channel a key driver of growth.\n\nDeep Discounts Across Categories\n\nAdobe expects Prime Day discounts to match last year’s levels, with the most attractive deals in apparel at 24%, followed by electronics 22% off, TVs 17% off, appliances 16% off, toys 15%, furniture 14%, computers 12%, and sporting goods 10% (read: 4 ETF Areas to Win Amid Slowing Retail Sales in May).\n\nAI Tools to Gather Traction\n\nGenerative AI-powered shopping assistants and chatbots are poised to play a bigger role this year.

The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Adobe belongs, has gained 6.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Adobe is expected to post earnings of $5.17 per share, indicating a change of +11.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.63 points to a change of +12% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.27 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Adobe is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:36:48.081701+00:00"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nSurrounding Amazon’s Prime Day shopping event, online spending is expected to reach $23.8 billion across U.S. retailers from Tuesday to Friday, according to an Adobe forecast shared with Retail Dive on Monday.\n\nThe anticipated performance would represent a 28.4% increase year over year when compared to July 16 through July 19 in 2024. Amazon’s Prime Day event will last four days for the first time this year, with its 2024 shopping event only consisting of two discount days.\n\nAdditionally, the expected online sales would mark the equivalent of two Black Fridays based on 2024’s $10.8 billion in online spend during the retail holiday, per Adobe.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWith the extension of Amazon Prime Day this year, shoppers are expected to take advantage of extra deals offered by the e-commerce retailer and its competitors, some of which have also extended their discount periods. Walmart’s discount event this month marks an extension for the mass retailer, now at six days compared to four in 2024.\n\n“[W]hat we aim to show is the incremental lift of extended deal days in driving consumer demand,” Vivek Pandya, director at Adobe Digital Insights, said in a comment to Retail Dive. “The strong growth Adobe is forecasting shows that discounts continue to be impactful in driving spend online (as consumers remain price sensitive), just like we had seen during the last holiday season.”\n\nPrice-conscious consumers could expect discounts in the range of 10% to 24% off listed prices, with the apparel category having the steepest discounts at 24% (increased from 20% in 2024). Consumers are also expected to utilize buy now, pay later services during the Prime Day shopping period, with Adobe anticipating BNPL to represent an 8% share of online spend compared to 7.6% last year.\n\nAmazon is aiming to target consumers looking for extra savings with the introduction of a “Today’s Big Deals” section this year. The feature will highlight a themed daily drop of products and refresh discounts as quickly as every five minutes on items from popular brands like Kiehl’s and Levi’s.\n\nAdobe predicts that the online shopping period surrounding Prime Day will also be a boom for back-to-school goods, such as backpacks and office supplies, when compared to June. Target’s competing event, Circle Week, was announced last month with a specific focus on school savings, featuring additional discount rates for teachers and students.

Some third-party merchants who previously sold China-made goods are pulling back this year. Consultants say it's a way for sellers to protect profit margins amid the trade war.\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated which retailers were covered by Adobe's forecast. The figures apply across all online retailers for Amazon Prime Days.\n\nTariffs and economic uncertainty are on the minds of shoppers as they prepare for Amazon's summer Prime Day sales.\n\nBut at least one company is forecasting that sales for the online sales event will break records as budget-conscious shoppers look for deals.\n\nAmazon is holding its annual Prime Day sales from July 8 through July 11 – twice as long as last year's event. The event, open to Prime members, has also offered early-access deals.\n\nStill, some Amazon third-party sellers are sitting out this Prime Day, amid pressures from tariffs.\n\nAdobe forecasts online sales to top $23 billion\n\nA record $23.8 billion in sales is expected to be spent by consumers across all online retailers for Amazon Prime Days, Adobe said in a forecast released on July 7. That's a 28.4% increase year over year and $9.6 billion more than the comparable period last year. Last year, online shoppers spent $14.2 billion during the two-day Amazon Prime event, according to Adobe. Adobe tracks online transactions covering more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and said their spending data is aggregated and anonymized. so it doesn't directly track Amazon's sales, but suggests demand for the Prime Day deals.\n\nAdobe said discounts for online retailers during Prime Days are expected to remain at historically high levels – on par with the major deals that consumers saw last year during the shorter sale. Overall, discounts across U.S. retailers will range from 10% to 24% off list prices with apparel expected to have the biggest deals at 24%, Adobe said. Other categories with major discounts include electronics (22%), televisions (17%), appliances (16%), toys (15%) furniture (14%), computers, (12%) and sporting goods (10%).\n\nConsumers are also expected to \"trade up\" to higher-ticket items, driven by strong discounts Adobe said.\n\nIn updated sales figures reported on July 9, Adobe said shoppers spent $7.9 billion at U.S. online retailers on July 8, the first day of the Amazon Prime Day event. That's a 9.9% growth from last year and marks the single biggest e-commerce day so far this year. That also beat the $6.1 billion spent on Thanksgiving Day 2024, but was under Black Friday, when $10.8 billion was spent.\n\nTariffs are affecting consumer purchase plans\n\nU.S. shoppers, in two separate surveys ahead of Prime Days, said looming tariffs were playing a role in how they are shopping.\n\nIn a 2025 summer spending survey of 1,024 U.S. shoppers by Smarty, an online shopping rewards app, shoppers were pretty evenly split in how tariffs were affecting their shopping habits for the Amazon sales. Thirty-two percent of shoppers said they were being more selective about purchases due to budget constraints, while 25% were planning to buy more items to avoid anticipated future price increases. Another 23% said they would focus specifically on categories likely to be affected by tariffs.\n\n\"This year's July Prime Day represents a perfect storm of seasonal shopping and economic anxiety,\" Vipin Porwal, founder and CEO at Smarty, said in a press release. \"Consumers are leveraging the discounts not just for immediate needs, but as a hedge against potential future price increases in tariff-affected categories. Prime Day will be an early indicator for consumer savviness in using major sales events as opportunities to make strategic purchases ahead of anticipated price changes.\"\n\nIn another study of 1,000 consumers by Akeneo, more than half or 57% of those surveyed said tariffs are impacting their Prime Day shopping habits with 25% saying they planned to skip or buy less because of possible price hikes. Four percent of shoppers surveyed said they planned to shop with other retailers, according to the survey by Akeneo, a software company that works with retailers on its products.\n\nSome sellers are not participating in Amazon Prime Day sale\n\nSome third-party merchants who previously sold China-made goods during Amazon's July event told Reuters earlier this year that they would be sitting out this year or reducing the amount of discounted merchandise they offer.\n\nThe pullback, Reuters reported, was a way for sellers to protect profit margins amid the U.S China trade war.\n\nIn April, Kim Vaccarella, chief executive of China-made tote bag company Bogg Bag, told Reuters that she had decided to skip Prime Day this year. Vaccarella said she wanted to retain some of her unsold U.S. inventory and hoped to sell to retailers and smaller, independent shops, at full price or for smaller discounts. She had also halted production of the bags, which sell for $70 to $200 on Amazon, while she worked to move manufacturing to Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nSmaller third-party Amazon sellers are more impacted by tariff costs than larger retailers, said Katherine Black, a partner at global management consulting firm Kearney where she leads food, drug and mass market retail.\n\n\"There have been a number of small suppliers that have said 'Look, I did some forward buys, but I'm holding that inventory to try to sell it close to full price to manage my exposure and I'm not going to participate this year,' \" Black told USA TODAY.\n\nPrime Day sales: I'm live-tracking the best Prime Day deals. Here’s what people are shopping today\n\nGood deals will still be available\n\nThere will still be plenty of deals for shoppers to choose from during Prime Days, Black said. She anticipates potentially seeing what she called big, showcase deals each day from big-named brands.\n\n\"Those are techniques we'll see when retailers are trying to drive traffic,\" she said.\n\nLauren Beitelspacher, a professor in the marketing division of Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, whose area of study includes retail thinks the Prime Day event will be successful, especially since consumers are more price-conscious right now with tariffs and there is tariff confusion.\n\n\"I think customers are just really looking for a deal wherever they can get one,\" she told USA TODAY.\n\nTen percent tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. began in April, with additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from more than 70 countries. President Donald Trump later delayed the reciprocal tariffs until July 9. The White House announced on July 7 that the deadline would be extended to August 1.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information and to fix a typo.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

Sketch Pro leverages multiple AI platforms, including Adobe Firefly and Google Veo 3, and boasts the ability to turn a concept into material ready for consumer testing within two hours.\n\nSketch Pro, which is already available in several markets, is positioned as helping Unilever navigate the transition from a marketing production model focused on linear TV to one centered on social-first storytelling. Unilever broadly is increasing its spending on social media and influencers to keep its brands tapped into culture.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSketch Pro offers another indication that legacy CPGs are undergoing a shift in their marketing strategy as social media becomes a more important channel and AI enables the level of speed needed to keep pace with fast-scrolling content feeds.\n\nSketch Pro was designed to support home care brands like Persil/Omo, Comfort, Cif and Domestos that have long relied on TV for mass reach but are contending with younger generations of consumers who don’t frequently tune in to broadcast or cable. TV production also tends to require a long lead time while brands today are expected to have lightning-quick reactions to moments and micro-trends bubbling up in culture, such as a gaffe from a public official that can be flipped into a marketing win.\n\nWhile Sketch Pro is billed as an internal “centre of excellence,” Unilever developed the concept with IPG Studios, Interpublic Group’s creative production agency. Sketch Pro emphasizes that it is not wed to a single AI platform, but instead promotes a flexible approach, with the goal of pushing creative boundaries. Among the group’s tools is Google’s Veo 3 AI video generator, which has recently garnered media attention for its ability to produce shockingly realistic content.\n\n“Our partnership with IPG supercharges our ability to ideate, iterate and deliver high-quality design assets with speed and cultural relevance, reflecting how consumers now engage with the home care category,” said Mario Dughi, global marketing director at Unilever, in a press statement.\n\nSketch Pro is currently live in London, São Paulo, Mumbai and Jakarta, while Unilever plans to expand the offering to 21 markets by next year. Around Ramadan, the Jakarta Sketch Pro Team was recently able to capitalize on holiday-related social trends to increase the visibility of brands including Rinso and Sunlight on TikTok by 22.5%, the announcement said.\n\nUnilever has made generative AI a focus as it tries to improve efficiency while cutting down on costs. Chief Growth and Marketing Officer Esi Eggleston Bracey in March detailed how the company is using AI solutions to create “digital twins” of products for brands like Dove that can be easily adapted across channels and formats. At the same time, Unilever is adjusting where it invests media dollars, with plans to allocate half of its marketing spend to social while significantly broadening its work with influencers.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:37:02.240593+00:00"}

DIS, Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. AEM, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Xylem Inc. XYL.\n\nBuy These 4 Stocks with Solid Sales Growth Amid Market Uncertainty\n\nMarkets began 2025 on a strong note but have since been gripped by heightened volatility due to the Trump administration’s tariff plans and geopolitical headwinds, which have resulted in uncertainty. The ambiguity has clouded expectations around the tariffs’ potential impact on the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions. Hence, investors are approaching the markets with increased caution.\n\nSo, the conventional method of selecting stocks is the need of the hour. One such way is choosing stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, The Walt Disney Co., Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., Adobe Inc. and Xylem Inc. are worth considering.\n\nWhen evaluating a company, investors often prioritize revenue over earnings, as growing sales indicate an expanding customer base and long-term potential. In contrast, stagnant or declining revenue can signal deeper operational challenges. While short-term profits can be achieved through cost-cutting, sustained earnings growth typically depends on consistent top-line expansion.\n\nHowever, revenue growth alone doesn’t paint a complete picture of financial health. A more effective investment strategy involves analyzing a company’s cash position alongside its sales. Strong cash reserves and healthy cash flow offer the flexibility to navigate challenges, invest in growth opportunities and maintain operational stability.\n\n4 Stocks with Robust Sales Growth to Bet On\n\nBurbank, CA-based Disney has assets that span movies, television shows and theme parks. DIS operates through three segments: Entertainment, Sports and Experiences.\n\nDisney’s expected sales growth rate for 2025 is 4.1%. DIS carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines, headquartered in Canada, is a gold producer. AEM has mining operations in Canada, Mexico and Finland, and exploration activities in Canada, Europe, Latin America and the United States.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines’ expected sales growth rate for 2025 is 24.6%. AEM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nAdobe, based in San Jose, CA, is a leading technology company. ADBE provides a personalized digital experience by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its solutions.\n\nAdobe’s sales are expected to rise 9.5% in fiscal 2025. INTU carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\n\nWashington, D.C.-based Xylem is one of the leading providers of water solutions worldwide.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Adobe, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Adobe\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Ownership Breakdown July 5th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Adobe?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Adobe. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Adobe, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Earnings and Revenue Growth July 5th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Adobe. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.7%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.5% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.8% of the company stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments.

Each is using AI in a different way, but all are seeing solid traction with their AI offerings.\n\nLet's look at why all five of these stocks appear to be solid investment options over the long term.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir has gone from polarizing to a powerhouse. Its revenue is not just growing quickly, it's accelerating. The first quarter marked the seventh straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth, up 39% year over year. U.S. commercial sales are leading the way, surging 71% last quarter, as customers embrace its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Meanwhile, its government business continues to see strong traction. U.S. government revenue jumped 45% last quarter, while the company also recently secured a large contract with NATO.\n\nAIP is what makes Palantir special. The platform doesn't just gather and analyze data; it structures it into an \"ontology\" that links digital inputs to real-world assets. This allows its software to use AI to identify risks and provide real solutions. The company has also recently added AI agents to its platform to automatically act on those solutions.\n\nCurrently, AIP is being used by companies across a wide range of industries to help solve very different problems. This breadth of use cases is why Palantir has such a huge growth opportunity still in front of it.\n\n2. GitLab\n\nGitLab is at the heart of secure software development. Already a leader in DevSecOps (development, security, and operations), the company just launched GitLab 18, which includes over 30 enhancements to its platform, highlighted by its new GitLab Duo Agent Platform. This allows users to deploy AI agents across the entire software development life cycle, not just for code generation, but for tasks like testing, documentation, and compliance.\n\nIt's addressing a key pain point, as according to a recent William Blair survey, developers spend only about 20% of their time writing code, leaving huge room for productivity gains in the remaining 80%. The launch also brought new features in security and compliance, while GitLab expanded partnerships with Amazon and Anthropic, reinforcing its DevSecOps leadership.\n\nGitLab has seen strong revenue growth, including 27% last quarter. Customers are expanding seats and upgrading to higher tiers as AI-driven development takes off. While some fear that AI might replace developers, GitLab is proving it can make them far more efficient, and that makes the company a long-term winner.\n\n3. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce is pushing to become a digital workforce leader with its Agentforce platform. Already the dominant player in customer relationship management software, it's using its huge installed base to launch a new AI agent ecosystem. With over 4,000 paying customers since its October launch, Agentforce is off to a strong start.\n\nThe company's strategy centers on unifying apps, data, automation, and metadata into a single framework called ADAM to power a digital labor force. It offers prebuilt agents and no-code tools through Agentforce so customers can build their own AI agents. It recently introduced a new flexible Agentforce consumption-based pricing model that is more aligned with outcomes in order to help increase adoption and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nIf Salesforce can become a digital workforce leader, the stock will have a lot of upside from here.\n\n4. ServiceNow\n\nServiceNow is quietly becoming one of the most important AI software companies in the enterprise space. The strength of its platform has always been connecting siloed departments and helping organizations streamline their operations, but AI is helping take that to another level.\n\nServiceNow is helping companies digitize operations and cut costs, which is exactly what businesses need in today's uncertain macroenvironment. Its generative AI assistant, Now Assist, does this in several ways, including providing an AI chatbot to handle questions, a text-to-code generator, and a case summarization tool. While best known for its information technology (IT) management platform, it has broadened into other areas such as HR, customer service, and more through its Now Platform.\n\nAI is already fueling growth, with Pro Plus deals, which include its AI solutions, quadrupling year over year in Q1. With the help of AI, it looks like the company has a huge opportunity ahead.\n\n5. Adobe\n\nAdobe isn't chasing AI, it's weaving it into everything it does. Its Firefly generative AI model allows users to create content from text prompts that they can further manipulate with Adobe's creative tools, such as Photoshop. Importantly, it also provides intellectual property protection, which is important for enterprises that want to avoid any potential lawsuits. The strategy is bringing in new users and keeping existing customers locked in.\n\nBut Adobe's AI push extends well beyond creative professionals. It's also embedding AI tools into its Document Cloud and Express solutions to help users create content, analyze documents, and even automate marketing. Acrobat and Express products hit 700 million monthly active users last quarter, and subscription revenue for this segment jumped 15%.\n\nWhile it's not seeing explosive growth, Adobe is a solid AI compounder with a sticky customer base and expanding use cases.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:37:10.477334+00:00"}

Despite a sequential decline of 15% Adobe’s bright prospects, driven by an expanding AI portfolio, are noteworthy.\n\n\n\nSeveral factors are driving Adobe’s cash flow growth. Its core Digital Media segment, led by Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, continues to deliver strong recurring revenues. Subscription models provide consistent income, while growing adoption of AI-driven features, such as Firefly, Acrobat AI Assistant and Express, expands customer engagement and product stickiness. Adobe benefits from a rising Remaining Performance Obligations of $19.69 billion, with 67% expected to be recognized within a year, offering visibility into future cash inflows.\n\n\n\nThe question now is whether Adobe can maintain this momentum. With $5.71 billion in cash and short-term investments as of May 30, 2025, Adobe is well-positioned to continue investing in product innovation, AI integration and strategic acquisitions. Strong cash reserves also give Adobe flexibility to navigate economic headwinds while continuing share repurchases, evidenced by the 8.6 million shares repurchased in the second quarter alone, and currently have $10.90 billion remaining as part of its $25 billion authorization.\n\n\n\nFor investors, these indicators reinforce confidence in Adobe’s ability to deliver long-term value. As the company evolves from a creative software leader to a broader digital experience and AI powerhouse, its financial strength is laying the foundation for enduring momentum.\n\nMicrosoft & Salesforce Challenge Adobe’s Market Hold\n\nMicrosoft MSFT competes with Adobe through its robust cloud and productivity suites, particularly Azure and Microsoft 365 Copilot, which are integrated with creative tools and workflow automation. Unlike Adobe’s specialized product lineup, Microsoft’s scale across cloud and AI ecosystems offers seamless cross-platform selling opportunities. In third-quarter fiscal 2025, Microsoft generated roughly $37 billion, up 16% year over year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections.\n\n\n\nSalesforce CRM directly challenges Adobe in the digital marketing and experience space with Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud and Gen AI-powered customer tools. While Adobe excels in creative workflows, Salesforce leads in CRM-based automation and enterprise reach. In first-quarter fiscal 2026, Salesforce reported $6.5 billion in operating cash flow, up 4% year over year, underscoring the company’s strength in monetizing its platform and expanding its digital experience footprint.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:37:14.283502+00:00"}

The ambiguity has clouded expectations around the tariffs’ potential impact on the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions. Hence, investors are approaching the markets with increased caution.\n\n\n\nSo, the conventional method of selecting stocks is the need of the hour. One such way is choosing stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, The Walt Disney Company DIS, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Xylem Inc. XYL are worth considering.\n\n\n\nWhen evaluating a company, investors often prioritize revenue over earnings, as growing sales indicate an expanding customer base and long-term potential. In contrast, stagnant or declining revenue can signal deeper operational challenges. While short-term profits can be achieved through cost-cutting, sustained earnings growth typically depends on consistent top-line expansion.\n\n\n\nHowever, revenue growth alone doesn’t paint a complete picture of financial health. A more effective investment strategy involves analyzing a company’s cash position alongside its sales. Strong cash reserves and healthy cash flow offer the flexibility to navigate challenges, invest in growth opportunities and maintain operational stability.\n\nSelecting the Potential Winning Stocks\n\nTo shortlist stocks with impressive sales growth and a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow of more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.\n\n\n\nBut sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. Hence, we have added other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.\n\n\n\nP/S Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.\n\n\n\n% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.\n\n\n\nOperating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs — an optimal situation.\n\n\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means that the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.\n\n\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.

But its S-1 filing comes at a moment when the market for venture-backed IPOs looks better than it has in some time, from the meteoric debuts of AI infrastructure company CoreWeave (up 290% from its IPO price) to the blowout triumph of stablecoin firm Circle (up 519%).\n\nAs Figma moves to capitalize on the bullish conditions for new issuers, a key question for its venture investors and employees is whether it can top the $20 billion valuation that Adobe was prepared to pay for it before the deal fell through due to intractable regulatory resistance, particularly in the U.K. A tender offer that Figma organized last year for employees to cash out some shares valued the company at $12.5 billion.\n\nAnd as investors champ at the bit for opportunities to ride the AI wave, Figma must make the case that it can harness the power of generative AI to tap into new growth without itself becoming a victim of AI.\n\n“We’re already investing heavily in AI, and we plan to double down even more in this area,” CEO and cofounder Dylan Field wrote in a “letter to investors” included in the prospectus. “AI spend will potentially be a drag on our efficiency for several years, but AI is also core to how design workflows will evolve going forward.”\n\nTo judge by its S-1 filing, the design company’s business is growing robustly. In Q1 2025, Figma’s revenue increased 46% to $228.2 million from $156.2 million in Q1 2024, according to the filing.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nAdobe Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman & CEO, Shantanu Narayen, for US$13m worth of shares, at about US$526 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$387). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.\n\nHappily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.5m for 3.55k shares. On the other hand they divested 32.95k shares, for US$17m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Adobe shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Specifically, Senior VP Jillian Forusz ditched US$176k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Adobe insiders own about US$274m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:37:48.146987+00:00"}

However, Trump announced sprawling tariffs soon after moving into the White House.\n\nFears of a global trade war led to the stocks tumbling in April, with the index retreating as much as 18% for the year and nearly entering a bear market.

A series of positive developments is also helping the benchmark.

China concerns and the loss of a key client have weighed on chipmaker Qualcomm.  Indeed, that is likely true with many technology companies whose heydays have come and gone.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/27/3-cheap-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/", "published_at": "2025-06-27T14:15:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "When investors hear the phrase \"cheap tech stocks,\" they might assume these are shares that have been left behind by the industry. Indeed, that is likely true with many technology companies whose heydays have come and gone.\n\nStill, there are some investment theses that remain intact even as tech enterprises face a variety of near-term challenges. These companies offer an opportunity for investors looking for high-quality stocks -- some of them at discounted valuations.\n\nHere are three tech stocks that offer investors potential opportunities for outsize returns.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) -- also known as TSMC -- has attracted attention as the world's largest and most advanced semiconductor foundry. It manufactures chips designed by Apple, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and other tech giants. Thanks to its technical lead, it claims a 68% market share, according to TrendForce.\n\nSo strong is its financial performance that first-quarter revenue surged 42% higher to almost $26 billion from the year-ago quarter. While expenses also rose significantly during that time, net income increased 60% to $11 billion over the same period.\n\nGiven this trend, it will likely not surprise investors to know that TSMC stock is near all-time highs. Overall, the stock price rose by around 20% over the past year.\n\nAmid its growth , its price-to-earning ratio stands at 27. While that is close to the S&P 500 average P/E ratio of 29, that earnings multiple is arguably cheap when also factoring in the aforementioned 60% increase in net income.\n\nAdmittedly, concerns about most of its foundries being located in the geopolitically contentious location of Taiwan may concern some investors. However, both the U.S. and China need its chips, reducing the likelihood of an attack. When also considering the artificial intelligence (AI)-driven demand and the reasonable P/E ratio, investors are highly likely to beat the market with TSMC stock.\n\nAdobe\n\nAdobe (ADBE 1.37%) first came into existence in 1982, and its software has long been a fixture in the tech industry.\n\nInvestors likely know it best for its Acrobat PDF software and other products that are part of its Creative Cloud, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. The segment managing those products accounted for just under 75% of Adobe's revenue in the second quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended May 30). Also, with these products having existed for decades, it has built a loyal user base.\n\nMost of its remaining revenue comes from its Experience Cloud. This offering entails a suite of cloud-based services for business customers that leverage advertising, marketing, analytics, and commerce to offer personalized experiences to one's customer base.\n\nBoth segments continue to grow yearly revenue in the low double digits. Nonetheless, competing products could pressure Adobe's growth, and more investors appear skeptical of its ability to monetize Firefly, its suite of generative AI models and tools.\n\nAll in all, Adobe's $5.9 billion in revenue for fiscal Q2 rose 11% compared to the same quarter last year. Still, expense growth closely approximated that of revenue And net income grew by just 8% to $1.7 billion due to higher interest expenses and lower non-operating income.\n\nInvestor concerns seemed to be influencing Adobe stock more than its financial growth, as the shares have fallen by almost 30% over the past year.\n\nStill, investors should note that Adobe sells at 24 times earnings, its lowest P/E ratio since the early 2010s. Given that valuation and the continuing popularity of its products, investors may find opportunity by buying at these levels.\n\nQualcomm\n\nQualcomm's (QCOM 3.89%) challenges in recent years have probably dampened investor sentiment toward the stock. The company has depended heavily on China, and tenuous U.S.-China relations could put the company in a weakened position. Moreover, Apple has begun producing smartphone chipsets in-house, which probably means it will lose this major client.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm has long worked to reduce its dependence on smartphones, pivoting into the Internet-of-Things (IoT), automotive, PC chips, and data centers. That approach has shown signs of early success.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025's second quarter (ended March 30), annual revenue for the IoT and automotive segments increased by 27% and 59%, respectively. That is far above the 12% revenue increase in handsets, though that segment still accounts for 63% of Qualcomm's revenue.\n\nAdditionally, after falling as recently as fiscal 2023, overall revenue rose 17% to year over year to just under $11 billion in the fiscal second quarter. Qualcomm also kept cost and expense increases in check, resulting in fiscal Q2 net income of $2.8 billion, a 21% increase over the same period.\n\nEven with these financial improvements, the company's struggles have weighed on the semiconductor stock, leading to Qualcomm shares falling by around 33% over the past year.\n\nNonetheless, considering the P/E ratio of 15, its valuation likely accounts for Qualcomm's challenges. As the company's other segments become more of a catalyst for the company, Qualcomm stock should surge in the coming years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:37:55.364765+00:00"}

Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$5.9b and statutory earnings per share of US$3.94. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nNasdaqGS:ADBE Earnings and Revenue Growth June 27th 2025\n\nAfter the latest results, the 38 analysts covering Adobe are now predicting revenues of US$23.6b in 2025. If met, this would reflect a modest 4.3% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be US$16.20, roughly flat on the last 12 months. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$23.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$16.05 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nView our latest analysis for Adobe\n\nThere were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$493, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Adobe analyst has a price target of US$605 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$380. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Adobe's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 8.7% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 12% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 13% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Adobe is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:37:57.361050+00:00"}

Given the widespread global presence of this software maker, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\n\nThe global economy today is deeply interlinked, making a company's engagement with international markets a critical factor in determining its financial success and growth path. It has become essential for investors to comprehend how much a company relies on these foreign markets, as this understanding reveals the firm's potential for consistent earnings, its capacity to harness different economic cycles, and its overall growth prospects.\n\nParticipation in global economies acts as a defense against economic difficulties at home and a pathway to more rapidly developing economies. However, it also comes with the complexities of dealing with fluctuating currencies, geopolitical risks and different market dynamics.\n\nWhile analyzing ADBE's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nFor the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $5.87 billion, experiencing an increase of 10.6% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of ADBE's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations.\n\nDecoding ADBE's International Revenue Trends\n\nAsia-Pacific generated $832 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 14.17% of the total. This represented a surprise of -5.03% compared to the $876.05 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Asia-Pacific accounted for $807 million (14.12%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $760 million (14.32%) to the total revenue.\n\nOf the total revenue, $1.54 billion came from Europe, Middle East and Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 26.24%. This represented a surprise of +3.49% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $1.49 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $1.5 billion, or 26.29%, and $1.36 billion, or 25.64%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nProspective Revenues in International Markets\n\nThe current fiscal quarter's total revenue for Adobe, as projected by Wall Street analysts, is expected to reach $5.89 billion, reflecting an increase of 9% from the same quarter last year. The breakdown of this revenue by foreign region is as follows: Asia-Pacific is anticipated to contribute 14.7% or $867.48 million and Europe, Middle East and Africa 25.5% or $1.5 billion.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:38:01.423456+00:00"}

The overall market for natural and organic food at home, which SFM targets, is estimated to be around $290 billion within the total $1.6 trillion spent on food at home. Its private-label products continue to gain traction, accounting for 24% of total sales, with 300 new items launched last year, fostering customer loyalty.\n\nHere are four stocks from the eight that made it through the screening process:\n\nUsing the GARP principle, we ran a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.\n\nGARP investing prioritizes the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.\n\nAnother metric that growth and GARP investors consider is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for a strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan.\n\nA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.\n\nThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.\n\nThe strategy helps investors gain exposure to undervalued stocks with impressive prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of value and growth investing. Sprouts Farmers Market , Adobe , GE Aerospace and ResMed are some GARP stocks that hold promise.\n\nIf you are looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks offering the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSprouts Farmers plans to open at least 35 new stores in 2025, targeting approximately 10%-unit growth, supported by a robust pipeline of 120 approved sites and more than 85 signed leases. Embracing a multi-channel approach, Sprouts Farmers continues to adapt to shifting consumer shopping habits.

In this article, we will summarize the bull’s thesis on ZETA. Zeta Global Holdings Corp.'s share was trading at $16.81 as of June 24th. ZETA’s forward P/E was 25.84 and according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nWhy Reddit Inc. (RDDT) Went Down On Wednesday\n\neverything possible/Shutterstock.com\n\nZeta Global (ZETA) has recently caught investor attention after a sharp 12% move, yet its valuation remains compelling. The company operates as a global marketing technology firm leveraging AI to deliver strong returns on investment, underpinned by a recurring revenue model and a net revenue retention rate of 114%.\n\nDespite rapid growth—revenues up 35.6% and EBITDA nearing triple-digit gains—ZETA trades at just 2.5x next-twelve-months (NTM) sales and 12.0x EV/EBITDA, significantly below peers like HubSpot (HUBS), Adobe (ADBE), and Braze (BRZE), which are growing more slowly yet command higher valuation multiples. These dynamics position ZETA as a potential private equity buyout target within 12–24 months, with the current price offering a 1.5x–2x upside if such a transaction occurs.\n\nWhile this possibility introduces some strategic risk for long-term holders, it doesn’t invalidate the core investment thesis—ZETA remains a strong candidate for a multi-year position given its growth and operating leverage. However, the prospect of a take-private deal could cap long-term gains for those seeking extended compounding.\n\nEven in a conservative buyout scenario, the expected upside is approximately 50%, while a public growth trajectory could deliver over 100% gains by FY27 based on forward revenue estimates of $1.7 billion and a 5.0x sales multiple. Ultimately, ZETA combines aggressive topline growth, operational efficiency, and industry-low valuation—an uncommon mix in today’s market. These factors suggest meaningful rerating potential regardless of whether the company remains public or is acquired, making it a high-upside, catalyst-rich opportunity worth close consideration.\n\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Zeta Global Holdings Corp. by jasmichelle7 in January 2025, which highlighted the company’s resilience post-short report, insider buying, and strong AI-driven marketing platform. The company’s stock price has depreciated by approximately 14% since our coverage. This is because the thesis has yet to be fully realized. Oliver | MMMT Wealth shares a similar view but emphasizes Zeta’s undervaluation and buyout potential.\n\nZeta Global Holdings Corp. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 40 hedge fund portfolios held ZETA at the end of the first quarter, which was 39 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ZETA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nAdobe Systems (ADBE) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this software maker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Adobe is 14%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 11.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.5%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Adobe is 11.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9.4%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.5%.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:38:20.415402+00:00"}

The company has been collaborating with original equipment manufacturers like HP to develop next generation of AI PCs. HP’s recent line up of cutting-edge AI PCs including EliteBook X, EliteBook Ultra and EliteBook 8 are powered by Intel Core Ultra series processors.\n\n\n\nIntel closely worked with HP to pinpoint a set of AI applications that can deliver significant benefits to end users. INTC fine tunes and optimizes the performance of CPU, GPU and NPU resources, enabling HP to validate the applications for real-world use cases. During the venture, Intel tested around 12 configurations in eight AI PC models.\n\n\n\nLeveraging Intel’s AI optimized software packages, the Microsoft Power BI used by 115 million users demonstrated 45% faster speed compared with previous generation systems.

Such staggering advancements can immensely boost efficiency across an organization’s internal processes.\n\n\n\nAI is moving from a niche capability to a critical must have component for businesses.

This SoC is the fourth such product in the Snapdragon X processor line, following the successful launch of the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core, Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite series. Several OEMs such as Dell, ASUS and Samsung expanding their collaboration with Qualcomm to develop AI PCs.\n\n\n\nAMD’s flagship Ryzen AI 300 Series is also witnessing broad industrywide adoption.

The S&P 500 particularly had a remarkable journey this year.\n\nThe index has bounced back strongly after coming close to a bear market in April and has been hitting fresh highs over the past month. The recent S&P 500 rally is driven by renewed optimism surrounding rate cuts and massive investment in tech on the domestic front.\n\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Adobe Inc. ADBE, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Analog Devices, Inc. ADI and Arista Networks, Inc. ANET, which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nS&P 500 Hits New Record High\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 1.1% on Tuesday to end at 6,445.76 points, a new record closing high. This is the index’s seventh record close in less than a month. This was also the index’s 16th record close of the year.\n\nTuesday’s rally came after fresh data showed that inflation increased less than expected. The consumer price index rose 0.2% sequentially in July after increasing 0.3% in May, and missed analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.3%. Year over year, CPI rose 2.7% in July, also lower than the consensus estimate of a rise of 2.8%.\n\nCore CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.3% in July, in line with the consensus estimate. On a year-over-year basis, core CPI rose 3.1%, slightly higher than analysts’ expectations of a 3% rise.\n\nConcerns grew over the past few months that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could push up prices of goods, which could weigh on the economy. However, the CPI reading alleviated those fears to a great extent, raising hopes of a rate cut in September. This sent stocks on a rally, taking the S&P 500 higher.\n\nMarket participants are now pricing in a 94% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut in September, according to the CME’s FedWatch Tool. This was 85% before the release of the CPI report.\n\nInvestor Optimism Helping S&P 500\n\nThe S&P 500 has had a stellar year so far, marked by sharp ups and downs. After reaching a record high in February on hopes that Trump’s pro-business agenda would lift the market, the index nosedived in April.\n\nThe decline came after Trump, weeks into his presidency, announced extensive tariffs, sparking fears of a global trade war.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T14:39:31.507266+00:00"}
