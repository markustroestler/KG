Investing in these companies is a genius move, as they are vital.\n\nOne of them, in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm, is ASML (ASML 2.81%). ASML makes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines used in the chip manufacturing process. Without ASML, the advanced chip technology used today wouldn't be possible. As a result, it's one of the most important companies in the world.\n\nHowever, ASML's stock is flat year to date and down around 35% from its all-time high. With other tech giants constantly hitting new all-time highs in the current market, is ASML well positioned to do the same?\n\nASML's machines are used by foundries worldwide\n\nASML's technology is vital for cutting-edge chip fabricators. The chip foundry industry has only three major players: Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, and Samsung. Taiwan Semiconductor has been the biggest winner by far and is constructing new fabrication facilities worldwide to meet rising chip demand, driven by AI, including a $165 billion investment in the U.S. alone. Demand for ASML machines is mainly coming from Taiwan Semi, because the other two have been losing business.\n\nIt's no secret that Intel's foundry business has struggled. It's currently losing money, and Intel's CEO has indicated that it isn't willing to invest heavily in the business in an attempt to revitalize it. It will invest in capacity only if it can find a customer first.\n\nConsidering Intel's poor track record in the foundry business recently, this is a terrible idea, as Intel needs to showcase its prowess before it can take such an approach. Intel's business will likely continue to deteriorate, which causes a headwind for ASML amid less demand for its cutting-edge machines.\n\nSamsung isn't seeing as much success as TSMC, but it's also not struggling like Intel. Samsung has invested in new plants and recently partnered with Tesla to produce its AI6 chips. This partnership could cause increased demand, leading to more ASML machines being purchased.\n\nWith some of ASML's major customers not needing the capacity and TSMC, which is known for pushing ASML's machines to their technological limits, sometimes reluctant to upgrade them, the future isn't as bright for ASML as one might expect.\n\nThis pessimism showed up in ASML's financial results. Before Q2 earnings, management was adamant that 2026 would be a growth year, just as it had expected 2025 to be. Now management is taking this stance: \"While we are still preparing for growth in 2026, we cannot confirm it at this stage.\"\n\nThat's concerning for investors, which is why ASML's stock has done so poorly. However, the outlook beyond 2026 is still bright, and long-term investors (those willing to hold for at least five years) should still be excited about the stock.\n\nASML's long-term outlook is still intact\n\nOne of the reasons ASML gave that 2026 might not be a growth year was uncertainty about tariffs. ASML is based in the Netherlands, so it is a potential target of U.S. tariffs. Management's commentary regarding 2026 was given before the U.S. and European Union reached a trade deal, so this outlook may shift now that a trade deal framework has been reached.\n\nRegardless, management's long-term outlook of revenue between 44 billion euros and 60 billion euros by 2030 hasn't shifted, so whether the growth comes in 2026 or beyond is irrelevant as long as you're patient.\n\nOver the past 12 months, ASML's revenue totaled 32.2 billion euros, so ASML's revenue could come in at the high end of the projection over the next five years. If it does, there's no doubt that ASML will be a market-crushing stock.\n\nIf ASML's revenue comes in on the lower end of that guidance, though, ASML's returns could lag the market's, making it a poor stock pick. Time will tell which of these paths ASML's stock takes, but considering the sheer demand for chips and the stabilization of trade relations, I think it's likely that ASML will come in on the high end of that range, making it an excellent stock to buy today.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:57:57.325761+00:00"}

So severe was the drop in some stocks that many continue to lag the performance of the S&P 500 in 2025 despite dramatic recoveries.\n\nFortunately, a few have managed to outperform the index. Moreover, some even remain solid buys. Investors looking for AI stocks that can continue to perform should consider these names.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nIn a sense, the performance of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%) may not come as a surprise. The company dominates advanced semiconductor manufacturing, as competitors such as Samsung and Intel failed to match its technical prowess.\n\nConsequently, top chip design companies such as Nvidia and Apple outsource most manufacturing to TSMC, which holds a 68% market share in the third-party foundry market. Since such companies cannot run AI workloads without its chips, TSMC is one of the most essential companies in the AI industry.\n\nSo, it is little wonder that Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI chip industry of 29% through 2030. This means that doubts about the economy are much less likely to affect TSMC.\n\nIndeed, one can find little that is sluggish about TSMC's performance. In the first half of 2025, it generated nearly $56 billion in revenue, a 40% increase from year-ago levels. Over the same period, costs and expenses rose 24%. Thus, its net income of almost $24 billion was 60% higher than in the first two quarters of 2024.\n\nIt sells at a P/E ratio of 28. That valuation is unlikely to deter investors, considering its rapid growth, and should translate into gains for TSMC stock over time.\n\nUpstart Holdings\n\nThe fact that Upstart Holdings (UPST 0.02%) is a market beater so far in 2025 may come as a surprise. Its stock lost 19% of its value following Q2 earnings. Additionally, it had posted net losses for years before the current quarter. At one point in the 2022 bear market, it had even lost 97% of its value.\n\nNonetheless, Upstart is worth following, especially considering its ability to transform the credit scoring market. Fair Isaac's FICO score, the industry standard, has not had a major update since 1989.\n\nIn contrast, Upstart's model leverages AI to consider attributes overlooked by FICO. It trained its model on over 90 million data points and is working to increase its advantage in AI during the year. Such efforts have helped it uncover loan opportunities overlooked by FICO without adding to lender default risks.\n\nMoreover, amid a sluggish economy, the Fed appears poised to lower interest rates, which should encourage more consumers to take out loans. So far, it mainly scores personal loans, but expanding into auto and home equity loans should significantly broaden its addressable market.\n\nDue to a modest profit in Q2, Upstart has earned only $3.1 million this year. Still, revenue of $426 million in the first half of the year is up 59% yearly.\n\nAlso, recent losses temporarily left it without a price-to-earnings ratio. Still, considering its revenue growth, investors are likely to perceive its forward P/E ratio of 39 as reasonable, making it feasible for interested investors to cash in on this potentially lucrative opportunity.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nAnother company banking heavily on AI is social media giant Meta Platforms (META 3.16%). Over 42% of the world's population uses at least one of its social media sites daily.\n\nAmid such saturation, its user base growth slowed to 6%. Thus, to maintain rapid revenue growth over the long term, it leveraged its treasure trove of personal data to help clients train AI models.\n\nIn 2025 alone, it pledged between $66 billion and $72 billion in capital expenditure (capex) to compete in this space, investing heavily in technical improvements and data center capacity to maintain its leadership.\n\nAdditionally, digital advertising continues to drive growth for now. In the first two quarters of 2025, Meta generated $90 billion in revenue, 19% more than the same period last year. In comparison, costs and expenses grew 10% over the same time, allowing its $35 billion in profit for the first half of the year to rise by 36%.\n\nDespite those increases, Meta's stock sells for around 28 times earnings. Considering its rapid growth and growing role in AI, that valuation should make Meta stock attractive to prospective shareholders.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:57:58.627973+00:00"}

ASML expects this growth to be driven by both an increase in Low Numerical Aperture (NA) EUV capacity and initial shipments of High NA systems. Moreover, advanced customers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung, and Intel, are expected to add around 30% more EUV capacity compared with 2024, which would further contribute to its revenue growth target.\n\nThe higher productivity NXE:3800E systems, which are now shipping at full specification of 220 wafers per hour configuration, will allow its customers to expand capacity with the same number of systems but at higher average selling prices, resulting in improved margins. In DRAM manufacturing, these systems replace complex multi-patterning deep ultraviolet (DUV) steps with single EUV exposures, reducing cost, shortening cycle times, and improving yields.\n\nAdditionally, demand is being driven by artificial intelligence (AI) applications, which are driving investment in both logic and memory chips. Logic customers are adding leading-edge node capacity, and DRAM customers are adding more EUV layers to their latest and future nodes.\n\nASML has also shipped its first EXE:5200B High NA system, which is designed for high-volume manufacturing and offers about 60% higher productivity than the EXE:5000, and is expected to contribute to the 2025 EUV revenue growth target.\n\nASML faces risks arising from macroeconomic uncertainties, rising geopolitical tensions and tariffs, which could hurt the timing of customer spending. Despite these risks, ASML expects total revenue growth for 2025 to be around 15%, supported by the product mix shift toward advanced logic and DRAM production using advanced EUV lithography systems. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ASML’s 2025 revenues is pegged at $37.83 billion, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 23.8%.\n\nHow Competitors Fare Against ASML\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) and KLA Corporation (KLAC) are also key players in advanced chipmaking tools. Applied Materials supplies equipment used in chip fabrication, especially for patterning and deposition steps that can complement or compete with EUV. KLA, on the other hand, focuses on process control and metrology, where its tools are vital in ensuring chip quality.\n\nBoth companies benefit from growing semiconductor complexity and are investing in next-generation technologies. While they don’t manufacture EUV systems, they are critical to the same ecosystem and could benefit from an AI-driven push for smaller, more complex nodes that support ASML’s EUV growth.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:58:01.413358+00:00"}

During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, which TSMC falls in, has gained 5.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, TSMC is expected to post earnings of $2.53 per share, indicating a change of +30.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +37.5%.

If the current pace holds, VOO is set for another $100 billion-plus inflow year, following a record $117 billion in 2024.\n\n\n\nThe fund has been powered by strong stock market gains, Vanguard’s investor-friendly reputation, its ultra-low expense ratio, better tax structure and the dividend reinvestment option.\n\nStock Market Remains Bullish\n\nThe S&P 500 has been on a solid surge driven by optimism over AI trade, a solid earnings season and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September.\n\n\n\nDemand for data centers, GPUs, AI-focused software and automation tools is driving investor enthusiasm across the board. Meanwhile, the overall earnings picture remains strong and resilient. The outlook for the current and coming quarters has started improving, with a favorable revision trend particularly notable for the Tech sector. Total Q2 earnings of S&P 500 companies are up 11.6% year over year on 5.9% revenue growth, with 80.4% beating EPS estimates and 79.1% beating revenue estimates. With this, aggregate Q2 earnings are on track for a new all-time quarterly record.\n\n\n\nThe latest economic data have raised the odds for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when it next meets in September. Lower interest rates will benefit the stocks, which are more sensitive to borrowing costs. It will also ramp up consumer spending, which bodes well for economic growth.\n\n\n\nFurther, President Trump announced a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, but exempted companies that manufacture in the United States or are committed to U.S.-based production, benefiting major players like Apple AAPL, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, Samsung and SK Hynix. This relief sparked a rally in chip and tech stocks (read: ETFs Set to Benefit from Apple's $100B U.S. Bet).\n\n\n\nThe gains came despite the tariff chaos. Trump began imposing higher import taxes on nearly 200 countries, ranging from 10% to 50%, last week.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:58:12.734852+00:00"}

As of this writing, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 8%, 10%, and 4%, respectively.\n\nYet, our three Motley Fool contributing analysts have their eyes on three stocks with gains far exceeding those of the major indexes: Roblox (RBLX -0.90%), MercadoLibre (MELI 2.29%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%).\n\nHere's what they like about them.\n\nGrow a Garden's popularity is helping to drive Roblox's stock price higher\n\nJake Lerch (Roblox): Shares of Roblox have more than doubled year to date, advancing some 132% as of this writing. Yet, I think there's still time for investors when it comes to Roblox. Here's why.\n\nFirst, Roblox's latest quarterly earnings report paints a clear picture: The company is hitting key benchmarks in its effort to establish itself as a key player within the global gaming market.\n\nRoblox's revenue for the second quarter (the three months ending on June 30, 2025) increased to $1.1 billion, up 21% from a year earlier. Daily active users and hours engaged rose by 41% and 58%, respectively.\n\nMuch of this growth is thanks to Roblox's latest blockbuster gaming hit, Grow a Garden, which has smashed popularity records previously held by other famous video games, such as Fortnite. In July, the game set another record with 21.9 million concurrent players, besting a previous record set in June.\n\nThe massive popularity of Grow a Garden isn't just good for headlines, but also for Roblox's bottom line -- and its stock price. Roblox's bookings, which represent future revenue flows, increased dramatically during Q2, rising to $1.4 billion, an increase of 51% year over year. Furthermore, the company raised guidance for third-quarter bookings to around $1.6 billion.\n\nGranted, it wasn't all good news. Roblox also reported an overall net loss of $278 million -- its most considerable quarterly net loss in more than a year. However, free cash flow remains positive, and the company's balance sheet is solid, with $2.6 billion in cash versus $1.8 billion in debt.\n\nRoblox stock has soared this year thanks to its solid growth and a big hit game. Investors who are willing to hold through volatility may want to consider the stock now, despite its big run-up this year.\n\nIt's onward and upward for this Latin American tech giant\n\nWill Healy (MercadoLibre): MercadoLibre is unlikely to stop at its 42% gain since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe company's e-commerce, fintech, and logistics businesses have successfully worked together and separately to drive rapid revenue growth and market leadership in their respective areas.\n\nThe company has capitalized on its first-mover status in Latin America in e-commerce, holding its own against competitive threats. It accomplished this in part through Mercado Pago, offering digital payment methods for cash-based customers. Investments in logistics locally gave it a competitive advantage over the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Sea Limited (NYSE: SE), and selling advertising on the site has also contributed to its success.\n\nAdditionally, Mercado Pago fostered success in fintech, and the company expanded this business to serve customers not buying on MercadoLibre's site. Likewise, the logistics network became known as Mercado Envios, and aside from fulfilling and shipping MercadoLibre orders, it acts separately to bring same-day and next-day delivery to parts of Latin America.\n\nWith that, its financials show growth potential and a few challenges. In the first half of 2025, revenue of nearly $13 billion grew 35% compared to the same period last year.\n\nStill, costs and expenses grew 36%. Expanded free shipping and higher marketing costs led to much of this increase. A 57% increase in the provision for doubtful accounts amid an expanding credit portfolio also weighed on expenses. With that, MercadoLibre reported a net income of $1.4 billion in the first two quarters of the year, rising 24% compared to the same year-ago period.\n\nAdmittedly, MercadoLibre did not offer specifics on its forward guidance. Nonetheless, given the company's history, investments in it are likely to pay off in future quarters. The company will probably make adjustments to improve the returns from its credit portfolio over time.\n\nFurthermore, while its price-to-earnings ratio of 59 points to a somewhat pricey valuation, such an earnings multiple will likely not deter MercadoLibre bulls given its revenue growth. As it stays on its current trajectory, an expanding market in its home region is likely to continue taking MercadoLibre stock higher.\n\nAI growth continues to trickle to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nJustin Pope (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): The tariffs announced on \"Liberation Day\" plunged non-U.S. companies into uncertainty, but Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has rebounded. The stock has surged over 23% this year.\n\nWhile Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's leading foundry (semiconductor manufacturer), is based in Taiwan, it has made serious investments to establish operations in the United States, helping the company gain a favorable status with the Trump administration. At the same time, the company is putting up stellar business results due to an insatiable appetite for chips used in artificial intelligence data (AI) centers.\n\nThe company's sales grew by a whopping 38.6% year over year in the second quarter of 2025, while its net income rose 60.7%. Counterpoint Research estimates that Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue share of the global foundry market has increased from 58% in Q2 2023 to 67% as of fourth-quarter 2024. That paves the way for continued growth, with data center spending potentially approaching $7 trillion over the next five years.\n\nWall Street analysts estimate that Taiwan Semiconductor will grow earnings by an average of 21% annually over the next three to five years. The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, a bargain valuation if the company grows anywhere near analyst projections. That makes Taiwan Semiconductor a solid bet to continue building on its year-to-date rally.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:58:14.210955+00:00"}

The products also use AI technology to improve the user interface, making it easy to use and simple to understand. The AI reads and responds in real text, based on natural language models; in practice, Palantir’s users don’t need to learn machine language or computer coding to communicate with the AI – they can simply enter their requests in clear text and receive responses the same way. The technology is also amenable to real-time translations, making Palantir’s products easy to market internationally – the system just needs to be told what language it is using, and its translation algorithms handle the rest.\n\nThe first AI stock we’ll look at here is one of the leaders in the field. Palantir is well-known for marrying AI technology and capabilities to the field of data analysis, a match that has matured into a solid product platform – AIP, or AI Platform – and a set of tools whose wide applicability has made them highly popular. Since its founding in 2003, Palantir has developed a reputation for innovation, and has built itself into a $441 billion giant of the AI industry.\n\nWith numbers like these, it’s no surprise that UBS analysts are combing through the sector to pinpoint the most promising AI stocks. Their latest deep dive zeroes in on two recent earnings reporters – Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) – to see which is the superior AI stock to buy. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nThis equals big money for the AI developers out there. Chip makers, AI app creators, data analysis firms – all of these and more have created an industry that was valued at $233 billion last year, and is estimated by Fortune Business Insights to hit $294 billion this year – and to show a CAGR of 29.2% through 2032, reaching $1.77 trillion that year. We should note that North American AI companies, mainly in the US, are leading this industry, with a 2024 market share of nearly 33%.\n\nTake advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off!

More and more companies are turning to the technology to enhance all sorts of functions, from customer service to chatbots to high-level data analytics and even to decision-making processes. According to Fortune Business Insights, up to 35% of all businesses have integrated AI into their work models.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company’s products and capabilities have proven particularly popular in government use, especially in the Department of Defense. This is clear from the company’s frequent announcements of new projects; DoD contracts and partnerships are regularly featured. Two examples: in July, Palantir announced that it had entered into a joint program, Warp Speed for Warships, with BlueForge Alliance, to accelerate warship production, fleet readiness, and digital transformation for the US Navy. And in June, the company launched a strategic partnership with Accenture, for the deployment of commercial-grade, AI-powered solutions designed to meet the high-priority operational challenges across a wide range of Federal agencies.\n\nIn its last quarterly report, covering 2Q25, the company announced a series of strong gains in key metrics. The company’s customer count was up 43% year-over-year, providing a base that supported a 48% YoY jump in revenue, to $1.004 billion – marking Palantir’s first billion-dollar quarter and beating the forecast by $60.5 million. At the bottom line, Palantir realized non-GAAP earnings of 16 cents per share, 2 cents per share better than had been expected. The company’s quarterly adjusted free cash flow came to $569 million, which represented a margin of 57%. And the company finished the quarter with cash and liquid assets totaling $6 billion.\n\nAbout the only thing that has grown faster than Palantir’s financial markers was the company’s share price. Year-to-date, shares in Palantir have far outpaced the broader markets. PLTR trades on the NASDAQ, which is up 11% so far this year, and it is a component of the S&P 500 index, which is up 9%; at the same time, for the year-to-date, PLTR has gained an impressive 147%. For the past three years, the stock’s gain is over 1,849%.\n\nCovering Palantir for UBS, 5-star analyst Karl Keirstead notes the company’s strong performance, yet he finds it impossible to ignore its high valuation. He writes, “Palantir reported its 8th straight quarter of revs growth acceleration, a turnaround that we’ve never seen before, from 13% growth in 2Q23 to a 2Q25 growth rate of 48%, while at a $4 billion revs scale. Palantir raised the full year 2025 total growth guidance to 45% from 36%, without compromising on the non-GAAP margin target, which was inched up to 46%. Palantir is benefiting from a confluence of mega-trends in AI application development, investments at the data layer and the modernization of defense tech, but valuation at 136x CY26E FCF remains our key hurdle…”\n\nThat hurdle leads Keirstead to rate PLTR as Neutral (i.e., Hold). His price target on the stock is $165, implying a one-year downside of ~12%. (To watch Keirstead’s track record, click here)\n\nThe Street generally would seem to agree with the UBS view. PLTR has a Hold consensus rating, based on 19 recent analyst reviews that include 4 to Buy, 13 to Hold, and 2 to Sell. The shares are priced at $186.96 and have an average price target of $152.12, suggesting that the share price will fall by ~19% in the next 12 months. (See PLTR stock forecast)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nNext up on the AI stage is AMD, a fast-rising contender steadily climbing the semiconductor ranks with a solid growth streak. It may not yet belong to the trillion-dollar club alongside Nvidia, Broadcom, and TSMC, but with a market cap near $280 billion, AMD is far from a lightweight. Over the past four quarters, it has pulled in roughly $30 billion in revenue, powered by a diverse portfolio spanning PCs, gaming rigs, and the surging AI/data-center market. Here, AMD isn’t merely keeping pace – it’s going toe-to-toe with Nvidia in AI accelerators and challenging Intel in PC microprocessors.\n\nThat competitive edge has been sharpened in recent years as AMD shifted from its roots in PCs and gaming toward a bigger slice of the AI pie. The company now offers a broad lineup of AI solutions across CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing, with the flexibility to tailor products for specific customer needs – whether in data centers, at the edge, or in enterprise applications. This diversification isn’t just theoretical; it’s showing up in high-profile wins and an expanding product pipeline.\n\nIn June, AMD landed Nokia as a customer for its 5th generation EPYC processors, which will power the Nokia Cloud Platform – a deal that underscores the broad applicability of its technology. Just a month earlier, AMD unveiled new high-performance computing products, including the Radeon RX 9060 XT and Radeon AI PRO R9700 graphics cards, plus the Ryzen Threadripper 9000 Series processors, targeting growth in gaming, content creation, and AI workloads.\n\nIn 2Q25, AMD reported gains in both AI-related and gaming sales, with AI/data center sales climbing 14% YoY to $3.2 billion and gaming revenue surging 73% to $1.1 billion. Client revenue hit a record $2.5 billion, up 67% vs. the previous year, helping overall revenue climb 32% to $7.685 billion, thereby beating the estimates by $260 million. Non-GAAP EPS came in at 48 cents, in line with expectations, while cash on hand totaled $4.44 billion. For Q3, AMD anticipates revenue of ~$8.7 billion, with a possible variation of $300 million, compared to the $8.32 billion consensus estimate.\n\nThat performance has caught the eye of UBS’s Timothy Arcuri, an analyst who ranks in 6th spot amongst the thousands of Street stock experts, who sees reasons for both caution and optimism.\n\n“AMD beat (on revenue) and guided above, but only to about where investor expectations were into the print. The bear would say that the beat was largely gaming-driven and while data center GPU is seeing a strong inflection in 2H, this was already baked into expectations and AMD did not raise the full year outlook for data center GPU despite all of the hyperscaler capex increases. In the very near-term, this may carry the day, but we think the path of travel for the business – and ultimately the stock – remains in a positive direction.”\n\nLaying out a supporting case for buying in, the 5-star analyst goes on to say, “First, excluding China, AMD’s data center GPU business is growing at a rate roughly similar to NVDA in C2H:25… Second, the outlook for market share growth in both the server and desktop portion of the CPU business is very strong with INTC’s roadmap under duress – combined, these are ~35% of AMD’s revenue and accretive to margins. Third, we would like to see gross margin inflecting quicker, but the underlying trends are still up and to the right with AMD able to at least hold GM flat even in CQ3 where the mix is unfavorable.”\n\nThat conviction earned AMD a Buy rating from Arcuri, who set a $210 price target – pointing to a potential 21.5% gain over the next year. (To watch Arcuri’s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, AMD boasts a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 37 analyst reviews that break down to 25 Buys and 12 Holds. The stock’s current trading price of $172.76 is slightly below the $180.78 average target price, implying a modest one-year upside of ~5%.

Tom Cotton over his ties with China. In April, a Reuters report detailed Tan's wide-ranging investments in Chinese companies made through his VC firm, Walden International.

But if we dig just a bit deeper, we'll uncover three cheap tech stocks that are still worth buying today: Verizon (VZ 0.10%), Qualcomm (QCOM 3.89%), and United Microelectronics (UMC 1.26%).\n\n1. Verizon\n\nVerizon, one of America's top telecom companies, is often considered a reliable long-term income investment. But over the past five years, its stock declined more than 25% as it struggled to gain new wireless and business wireline subscribers.\n\nTo offset that pressure, it's aggressively expanding its broadband business with its fixed wireless access (FWA) and FiOS fiber networks. Its planned acquisition of Frontier Communications, which is expected to close in 2026, will accelerate that strategy by adding at least 2.2 million new fiber subscribers.\n\nIt also aims to leverage the strength of its broadband business to launch more wireless and entertainment bundles, which could stabilize its weaker wireless segment and increase the stickiness of its services. In addition, its new services, which integrate its 5G networks with a wider range of artificial intelligence (AI) services, could bring back more enterprise customers and reduce the importance of its business wireline division.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Verizon's revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2% and 3%, respectively. Its stock trades at just 6 times this year's adjusted EBITDA, and its hefty forward dividend yield of 6.3% is supported by a low payout ratio of 63%. That stable growth, low valuation, and high yield should make it a great stock to buy and hold, even if the broader market swoons.\n\n2. Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm is one of the world's leading producers of system on chips (SoCs) -- which bundle together a central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), and modem -- for smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. It also produces chips for connected cars and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It generates most of its revenue from its SoCs, but most of its profits come from its licensing business, which leverages its wireless patents to earn royalties and licensing fees from every smartphone sold worldwide -- even if they don't use its chips.\n\nQualcomm's sales growth usually mirrors the smartphone market's boom and bust cycles. It suffered a severe slowdown in fiscal 2023 (which ended in September 2023) as the 5G upgrade cycle cooled. But in fiscal 2024, its revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 9% and 21%, respectively, as the smartphone market stabilized and it launched new chips for processing AI applications.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and EPS to both grow at a CAGR of 6%. That growth should be driven by its sales of newer chips for the auto, IoT, edge networking, and PC markets, and that diversification should reduce its dependence on smartphones and offset its eventual loss of Apple, which plans to replace Qualcomm's 5G modems with its own chips within the next two years.\n\nQualcomm certainly isn't a high-growth stock anymore, but it looks like a bargain at 12 times its forward adjusted earnings. Its forward yield of 2.4% is also buoyed by a low payout ratio of 33%.\n\n3. UMC\n\nUnited Microelectronics, more commonly known as UMC, is Taiwan's second-largest contract chipmaker after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 0.77%), or TSMC. But unlike TSMC, which manufactures the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips, UMC only produces larger, older, and cheaper chips for the lower-end and mid-range device markets.\n\nUMC is growing at a slower rate than TSMC, but it's still a linchpin of the semiconductor market. It will continue to scale up its production of chips for its mature nodes (28 nanometers to 90 nanometers), which are still widely used to manufacture analog, power integrated circuits (ICs), microcontrollers, display drivers, and IoT chips. The growth of the auto market could generate tailwinds for all those markets.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect UMC's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 5% and 2%, respectively. Those growth rates might not seem too impressive, but the stock looks cheap at 14 times this year's earnings. Its dividend fluctuates every year based on its earnings growth, but its high forward yield of 7.1% should limit its downside potential. That makes it an attractive value play on the secular expansion of the global semiconductor market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:58:42.849619+00:00"}

Here's what investors need to know today.\n\n1. US Stock Futures Gain After Nasdaq Hit Another Record\n\nStock futures are moving higher in premarket trading after tech stocks surged in the prior session. Nasdaq futures are higher by 0.3% in early trading after the tech-focused index gained 0.4% yesterday to close at a record high. S&P 500 futures are also higher after the benchmark index slipped in the prior session, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up by 0.2% after it fell 0.5% yesterday. The price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is little changed at just over $116,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is slightly higher at 4.25%. Oil and gold futures are on the rise, with the price of gold hitting another record high.\n\n2. TSMC Reports Strong July Sales on Demand for AI Chips\n\nTSMC (TSM) reported a 22.5% revenue jump in July compared with the prior month as the chipmaker continued to rake in sales from booming AI demand. TSMC said July revenue came in at $323.17 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.8 billion). For the year through July, TSMC’s revenue of $2.1 trillion New Taiwan dollars ($70.1 billion) reflected a 37.6% increase over its 2024 sales over the same period. TSMC shares are little changed in premarket trading after they gained more than 4% in the prior session amid optimism that the chipmaker could avoid higher chip tariffs due to its U.S. production facilities.\n\n3. Firefly Aerospace Stock Falls After Surging in IPO\n\nShares of Firefly Aerospace (FLY) are trading lower by nearly 10% in premarket trading after the space tech company soared in its first session on Thursday. Firefly, which counts the government's Space Force as a major client, ended its first trading session just above $60, up roughly 34% from its initial public offering price at $45 per share. The firm sold more than 19 million shares in the offering, raising roughly $868 million in proceeds, which the company said it plans to use in part to pay down debt. Firefly claims to be the first commercial firm to \"achieve a fully successful soft-landing on the Moon\" with its Blue Ghost lander in March.\n\n4. Intel CEO Says He Has Board Support After Trump Calls for Resignation\n\nIntel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan said he has the support of the company's board after President Donald Trump called for his resignation. In a message to the company's employees posted online, Tan said that he was engaging with the White House and that he shares Trump’s commitment to advancing U.S. national and economic security. Intel shares fell 3% in the prior session after Trump said that Tan was conflicted in his position. Intel shares are about 1% higher in premarket trading.\n\n5. Expedia Stock Surges After Earnings Top Expectations\n\nExpedia Group (EXPE) shares are jumping 16% in premarket trading after the travel booking service reported growing revenue and raised its full-year outlook on rising demand. Expedia reported a 6% year-over-year jump in quarterly revenue and 16% growth in adjusted net income, while its quarterly bookings were higher by 5%. The company also raised its outlook for total bookings in 2025 to reflect growth of 3% to 5%, up from its prior guidance of 2% to 4%.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:58:44.132096+00:00"}

Reuters reported exclusively in April that Tan had invested in hundreds of Chinese firms, some of which were linked to the Chinese military.\n\nTan may now have to mount an effort to reassure Trump that he remains the right person to revive the storied American chipmaker, pulling his focus away from the cost cuts he's trying to implement.\n\n\"It is distracting,\" said Ryuta Makino, analyst at Intel investor Gabelli Funds, which, according to LSEG data, owns more than 200,000 shares in Intel. \"I think Trump will make goals for Intel to spend more, and I don't think Intel has the capabilities to spend more, like what Apple and Nvidia are doing.\"\n\nAI chip market leader Nvidia and iPhone-maker Apple have committed hundreds of billions of dollars to expand domestic manufacturing, which, according to Trump, will bring jobs back home.\n\nUntil recently, Intel had emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the 2022 CHIPS Act, as former CEO Pat Gelsinger laid out plans to build advanced chipmaking factories.\n\nTan, however, has significantly pared back such ambitions, as the company's goal of rivaling Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC's contract manufacturing chops have fallen short.\n\nTan said last month that he would slow construction work on new factories in Ohio and planned to build factories only when he saw demand for Intel's chips, a move that is likely to further strain relations with Trump.\n\nThe company, its board and Tan were making significant investments aligned with Trump's America First agenda, Intel said in a statement on Thursday, without any mention of Trump's demand.\n\nThe statement was \"bland\", said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Intel shareholder Aptus Capital Advisors, which owns Intel stock through index funds.\n\n\"Either defend your leader, which will be the beginning of a difficult road ahead, or consider making a change,\" Wagner said. Having this play out over a few months is not something that Intel can afford, he said.\n\nTan himself released a statement late on Thursday. \"The United States has been my home for more than 40 years. I love this country and am profoundly grateful for the opportunities it has given me. I also love this company,\" he said, adding that the board was \"fully supportive of the work we are doing to transform our company.\"", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:58:48.131094+00:00"}

But Rahul Narang, a top manager, delivers benchmark-beating returns with lower risk.", "url": "https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/technology-mutual-fund-managers-secret-sauce/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo", "published_at": "2025-08-08T11:00:52Z", "source": "Investor's Business Daily", "text": "There's no such thing as a risk-free technology mutual fund.\n\nBut Rahul Narang, manager of Columbia Global Technology Growth Fund (CMTFX), has mastered the art of delivering benchmark-beating returns while taking middle-of-the-road risk.\n\n\"We're not out over our skis on the risk curve,\" said Narang, who started his investing career more than 30 years ago analyzing computer hardware companies.\n\nNarang says his views on risk were shaped during the 1999-2000 tech bubble working at a hedge fund as a short seller. Investing in value stocks at a later job broadened his skill set further. Thirteen years ago, he began managing Columbia Global Technology Growth, which he's grown from a $100 million fund to a $4 billion fund today.\n\nColumbia Global Technology Growth's winning formula? Invest in both secular growth companies and tech stocks that offer attractive value opportunities.\n\nThe fund is a 2025 IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, meaning it has topped the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2025, this top mutual fund is up 11.33% through Aug. 1, besting the S&P 500's 6.75% gain. IBD caught up with Narang to learn more about his investment philosophy and the state of tech stocks.\n\nTechnology Mutual Fund Goes For Wins\n\nIBD: What's the fund's main goal?\n\nRahul Narang: Consistently delivering strong, risk-adjusted returns over time.\n\nIBD: The fund falls dead in the middle of Morningstar's risk spectrum. Explain.\n\nNarang: Our philosophy is to build a global, diversified technology strategy, which offers a balance of secular growth opportunities and value opportunities.\n\nIBD: What do you look for in a stock?\n\nNarang: We try to own great businesses run by the best management teams regardless of market cap or geographic location. We're looking for sustainable competitive advantages, high barriers to entry, strong return on investment (ROE). We gravitate to moat-type businesses, which could come in the form of cost advantage, high switching cost, strong intellectual property, durable brand, global scale, pricing power or network effects on a durable platform. We really try to avoid businesses in secular decline.\n\nTech Fund Has Balanced Approach\n\nIBD: How did you come by this balanced approach to tech investing?\n\nNarang: In terms of portfolio construction, we've divided it into three buckets: moat-type businesses, secular growth themes and value opportunities. I spent seven years at a deep value shop. I wanted to come up with a unique technology strategy that will keep our clients in the game when there's a risk-off period.\n\nIBD: Cite examples of moat stocks the fund owns?\n\nNarang: These are names that we've owned for over a decade. That's really important. Our turnover is 7%, (which means the fund rarely sells stocks it owns). That's generated good tax-efficiency and compounding for our clients. The fund has posted compound returns of 20.5% over the past 10 years.\n\nNames include Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet (GOOGL), Broadcom (AVGO), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Booking Holdings (BKNG) and, yes, Nvidia (NVDA). We've held Nvidia for 11 years. (It's the fund's top holding with a 15.2% weighting, according to Morningstar.) It gives you a sense of the type of businesses we gravitate to and the long duration we hold these stocks.\n\nGuiding Moneymaking Factors\n\nIBD: What else is key to your investment philosophy?\n\nNarang: Identifying the correct theme and ride the curve over time. This can create tremendous shareholder value. Some of the themes we've been invested in over the years include cloud computing, cybersecurity, digital transformation, digital payments, autonomous driving, digital media and, of course, AI.\n\nIBD: Is AI a big focus of the fund?\n\nNarang: AI is now the largest theme in our strategy. We've been invested in this theme since 2016. AI names are sprinkled throughout the portfolio. And some of the emerging themes that we're doing work on currently include defense tech, quantum computing, and humanoid robots. In visual media we own (streaming service) Netflix (NFLX) and (music streaming platform) Spotify (SPOT). In cybersecurity we like CrowdStrike (CRWD). Names in digital payments would be Visa and Mastercard.\n\nKeeping Turnover Down At Tech Fund\n\nIBD: Why is your turnover so low?\n\nNarang: We tend to take a very long-term lens and realize that things usually don't go up straight to the right. There may be periods of digestion. You don't want to get shaken out of a theme based upon short-term noise.\n\nIBD: What's the final part of your investment strategy?\n\nNarang: The last bucket is value opportunities, which brings balance into the portfolio. Here's where the valuations are much cheaper and where we believe the inherent value of the business should be higher than the current stock price. Some examples include NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Samsung and Western Digital (WDC). Look at a company like Western Digital; they just reported quarterly earnings on July 30, and revenues were up 30% versus a year ago. The stock is trading around 15 times forward earnings.\n\nIBD: Why throw value stocks into a growth fund?\n\nNarang: This is part of our secret sauce. When we were constructing this approach 13 years ago, we looked at a lot of data. What we found (looking at research) is that over the last 40 years in technology investing, stocks in the most expensive and least expensive quintiles of valuation metrics tend to outperform, and names in the middle get stuck in growth purgatory.\n\nTech Fund Focused On The U.S.\n\nIBD: It's a global fund but U.S. tech stocks make up 91% of the fund. Why?\n\nNarang: What I've noticed over time is that the best business models with leading innovation are based here in the U.S.\n\nIBD: Talk about some foreign moat stocks.\n\nNarang: One of the names we own outside of the U.S. that have moat characteristics is Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). They're the largest semiconductor manufacturer tied to the AI theme. That's a top 10 position for us, and a name we've held for many years.\n\nAll the leading tech companies in the U.S., whether it's an Nvidia or an Apple (AAPL), have their chips typically manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor. They have one of the best management teams I've met. Taiwan Semiconductor won the foundry game. Taiwan Semiconductor is a classic example of a great business with a strong moat. And the valuation is also not egregious, plus they have pricing power. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it wouldn't surprise him if Taiwan Semiconductor were to raise prices because of the value that they add. They're also in the sweet spot of a big secular trend. They're right in the middle of this AI thing.\n\nOther global names include Samsung, which is more in the value camp. The stock's done well this year. It's up 30%-plus on the resurgence of orders, like the big $16.5 billion deal for Samsung to make chips for Tesla (TSLA) recently. And RELX (RELX) out of London has a really interesting AI and legal angle coming together.\n\nSafety With Moats\n\nIBD: These moat companies are the real deal, aren't they?\n\nNarang: Absolutely. When I look at AI, I divide them into pretenders versus contenders. My antenna goes off when I hear a lot of hype, and there's no real revenue. Those AI names I call pretenders. But then there's real companies that have real revenues and earnings. Obviously, Nvidia. Taiwan Semiconductor is right up there.\n\nIBD: Is the AI trade still alive?\n\nNarang: We've been invested in AI since 2016, so almost 10 years. But the inflection point, and this is really important, started to happen in late 2022 when companies finally had the computing power and data to harness more performance from these deep neural networks. And then OpenAI released ChatGPT in late November of 2022 for public use, which is (like) the iPhone moment for AI.\n\nMind The Downsides As A Tech Fund\n\nIBD: What are some risks?\n\nNarang: One needs to pay attention to the timeline of investments that companies are making around AI, as it may take time to see the ROI on these investments, or productivity improvements they were hoping for. We have seen a few 20% or so drawdowns in the AI complex over the last few years as they have proved to be excellent long-term buying opportunities. Other risks include government restrictions on chip sales to China, tariffs and geopolitics.\n\nIBD: What makes Nvidia, your top holding, a good core holding?\n\nNarang: We've held it for 11 years. If you want one AI name, Nvidia is it. They are very representative of what we call the picks and shovels of AI. Semiconductors provide the computing power for these cloud companies to harness the data that they have. That's key.\n\nPlug Into AI\n\nIBD: What other stocks are positioned to keep profiting from AI?\n\nNarang: We still feel like we're very early in AI. We saw stellar earnings results (last week) from Meta (META) and Microsoft. Meta is seeing strong performance in advertising, largely thanks to AI unlocking greater efficiency and gains across their app system. AI is improving engagement for their users. It's also improving Meta's ability to show people more relevant targeted content.\n\nMicrosoft, obviously, with their Azure cloud business. That business grew 39% in their latest fiscal quarter, and is now a $75 billion business. What's driving that? It's continued adoption in the cloud, and some AI workloads are moving into the cloud. You've got Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia. Another name that's benefiting from the AI theme is Broadcom, a name we've held for over a decade and our third-biggest holding. They do custom AI chips. One of their customers is Alphabet (GOOGL). It's been a monster of a compounder for us. They are part of the AI picks and shovels stocks. They're a huge semiconductor supplier with a great balance sheet, strong free cash flow generator. Hock Tan, the CEO, is probably one of the best CEOs in semiconductors, right up there with Nvidia's Huang.\n\nTech Fund Mines Big Earnings Gains\n\nIBD: What message does the blowout earnings from Meta and Microsoft send?\n\nNarang: We're seeing growth at scale and the moat widening for these megacap companies. That's the message.\n\nIBD: You're not worried about all the spending on AI?\n\nNarang: Let me just give you some estimates I saw this morning of the AI capital spending from the Big Five: Alphabet, Oracle (ORCL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta and Microsoft. These are just rough numbers, $350 billion plus in 2025 going to $450 billion plus in 2026. The point is these businesses have required a tremendous amount of capital, but then you're seeing Meta say, \"Oh, our revenue growth accelerated 22% from 16% in the first quarter.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says there's a very high chance the world is going to look pretty different a few years from now. So, this helps explain why we're seeing these strong capex numbers from the hyperscalers. The competitive landscape is changing so quickly, and they don't want to be left out.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, we're seeing growth and scale and moats widening. It's really remarkable.\n\nIs $4 Trillion The Limit?\n\nIBD: What do you say to investors who say, \"Nvidia and Microsoft are $4 trillion companies. How high can they go?\"\n\nNarang: It's funny, I got asked that question the day they hit $1 trillion, $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion. It's a fair question. We try to step back and look at the total addressable market: is it expanding? Are the companies seeing a return on their investment (ROI)?\n\nIBD: It's about sales and earnings, right?\n\nNarang: I remember 1999 when tech stocks were trading at 100, 200, 300 times earnings. They were trading on price to eyeballs. But this go around, these companies are generating real cash flows, real earnings, real scale, and they're not trading at crazy valuations. As long as the earnings come through, growth will continue to accelerate.\n\nIBD: To make money, do investors have to invest in these big trends like AI?\n\nNarang: One of the mistakes people make is that they identify a big trend correctly. But then when there's a little bit of noise, they get scared out (of the market). And then they miss that long-term (compounding) over time.\n\nTech Fund Taps Into The Legal Market\n\nIBD: Why are you bullish on RELX?\n\nNarang: We bought RELX a year or two ago. So, it's a newer name. They own an asset called LexisNexis, a legal database that law firms use. They are starting to bring AI capabilities into some of their legal products. It's a steady grower with good valuation support. We just saw this as an interesting asset tied to legal AI, and they have a real moat around their business, because their product, LexisNexis, is highly regarded in the legal field.\n\nIBD: What non-megacap companies are in the fund?\n\nNarang: Robinhood (HOOD), the financial services platform that's now valued at nearly $90 billion. They reported second-quarter earnings July 30 (and revenue jumped 45%, driven by crypto.) The stock was up 125%. It's a name we added this year.\n\nIBD: What do you like about Robinhood?\n\nNarang: Growth is accelerating. We really like their focus on the younger demographic. The pace of innovation at the company has been spectacular. Their strong position in crypto trading, along with product innovation, were two of the main reasons we started a position. (Another plus) is we just saw a sea change in the regulatory environment with the new Trump administration.\n\nAre We In A Tech Bubble?\n\nIBD: There's been talk of a bubble. Is the stock market frothy?\n\nNarang: In the bubble years of 1999-2000, Cisco was trading at 100 plus times earnings. Now Cisco trades at 16, 17 times earnings. Meta is trading around 27 times. The valuations are nowhere close to the 1999 bubble valuations. The other big difference is now the free cash flow characteristics of these tech companies are so much stronger than in prior years. Through the first quarter, tech free cash flow margins were 22%. That's three times the rest of the market. That points to the quality of the business.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:58:50.253056+00:00"}

Net income rose 60.7% Y/Yto $2.47 per share, above the $2.37 estimate. Gross margin expanded to 58.6%, and operating margin climbed to 49.6%, driven by high demand for 3-nm and 5-nm technologies, which accounted for 60% of total revenue.\n\nThe company guided third-quarter revenue between $31.8 billion and $33.0 billion, with gross margin projected at 55.5% to 57.5% and operating margin at 45.5% to 47.5%, supported by continued strength in leading-edge process technologies.\n\nKey revenue drivers included High-Performance Computing (60% of revenue) and Smartphones (27%), with North America contributing 75% of sales. Management also cited positive momentum from the U.S. government easing certain chip export restrictions to China, enabling Nvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales.\n\nChairman C.C.

As such, this remains a great area to invest in for the long haul. Let's look at three top AI stocks that are not only leading today but are positioned well for the next leg higher.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia (NVDA 0.58%) remains the backbone of the AI data center buildout. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) accounted for a staggering 92% of the GPU market in Q1, and the company isn't slowing down. It has accelerated its product development cycle, and will now look to introduce a new chip every year to help ensure its lead.\n\nThe company's real edge, however, isn't just its chips, it's its software platform CUDA. Nvidia offered its CUDA software platform for free years before AI went mainstream, pushing its use at universities and research institutions. That early move led to an entire generation of developers being trained on its platform, creating a flywheel effect as tools and frameworks got built on top of CUDA to improve its chip performance.\n\nThat strategy has paid off in a big way, as CUDA is now the foundation for AI development. While rivals scramble to catch up in hardware, they're years behind on software. Meanwhile, Nvidia continues expanding into new verticals. Its automotive business, which supports autonomous driving and robotaxis, could be its next big growth driver. The company also just got a boost after the Trump administration signaled that it will allow H20 chip sales in China, adding another growth catalyst.\n\nDespite its massive run, Nvidia still looks attractive with a PEG (price/earnings-to-growth) ratio of under 0.9, with PEGs below 1 considered undervalued. When you combine a dominant market position with explosive growth and a deep moat, Nvidia's long-term outlook remains extremely compelling.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is the world's most advanced foundry, and the go-to partner for top chip designers, including Nvidia. Unlike chip designers, TSMC wins no matter who dominates, as it manufactures the cutting-edge chips that power nearly all of them. That makes it one of the best ways to play the ongoing AI infrastructure boom.\n\nIts dominance in advanced nodes gives it unmatched scale and pricing power. Chips made on 7-nanometer and smaller nodes now represent nearly three-quarters of revenue, with 3nm alone hitting 24% last quarter. Apple has reportedly locked up much of TSMC's future 2nm supply, and the company is working with its top customers to increase its capacity to meet their rising chip demand. This gives it great visibility into future growth.\n\nTSMC's strength was on full display in Q2, with revenue jumping 44% in Q1 to $30.1 billion, driven by demand in high-performance computing. With the company predicting that AI chip demand is set to grow at a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028, it's hard to see this momentum slowing. Best of all, the stock is still trading at an attractive valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 24 based on 2025 analyst estimates and a PEG of 0.6.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) is proving the skeptics wrong. Search is not only surviving AI, it's thriving because of it. The company's AI Overviews are already used by over 2 billion people monthly, and global search queries are rising as a result. Last quarter, its search revenue accelerated to 12% growth, while its new AI Mode and Gemini app are just getting started.\n\nIts cloud computing segment is also booming. Google Cloud revenue surged 32% to $13.6 billion in Q2, while segment profit more than doubled to $2.8 billion. Alphabet's custom AI chips, including its new Ironwood chip, are proving cost-efficient and gaining strong acceptance. Capacity constraints remain a bottleneck; however, that is a good problem to have and why Alphabet will increase its capital expenditures to a whopping $85 billion this year.\n\nAt the same time, Waymo, Alphabet's robotaxi unit, is scaling quickly. Meanwhile, YouTube remains a solid growth driver with Shorts helping push ad revenue up 13% to $9.8 billion in Q2. AI tools like Veo 3 are also making it easier for creators to produce video content, adding another tailwind.\n\nAlphabet's AI push is driving top-line growth across each of its major business segments. The company is still posting double-digit revenue and earnings growth, yet trades at under 19.5 times forward earnings with a PEG of 0.8. That's a cheap valuation for one of the most powerful companies on the planet.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:58:53.677759+00:00"}

More than 100 of those investments were made in China, including deals with once-obscure startups such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. — today China’s largest chipmaker — where he served on the board for a decade and a half.\n\nIn recent years, as US-China tensions escalated, Washington increasingly restricted Beijing’s access to advanced technology and placed tighter limits on the ability of US companies to do business there. And Tan’s efforts to distance himself from Chinese investments accelerated with his appointment at Intel Corp. (INTC) in March, when he agreed to divest his holdings there, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped US lawmakers — and, now, Donald Trump — from holding Tan’s past Chinese affiliations against him. The US president called the executive “highly conflicted” in a social media post and urged him to resign.\n\nIntel has said Tan and the board are “deeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests.” Late on Thursday, Tan said he’s got the full backing of the company’s board, responding for the first time to Trump. “We are engaging with the Administration to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts,” he said in a letter to staff posted on Intel’s website.\n\nHere’s what we know about Tan’s business dealings in China.\n\nWalden\n\nHe started work at a venture capital firm in the 1980s called Walden Ventures, where he helped create a spinoff named Walden International that focused on overseas opportunities.\n\nTan, a Mandarin speaker born in Malaysia, helped the company make investments all over East Asia, including China.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Tan's ties to Chinese companies in a letter to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary. He noted that Tan, the former CEO at Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), had invested in Chinese semiconductor companies and others with connections to the country's military.\n\n\"Intel and Mr. Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the U.S. defense ecosystem,\" the company said in a statement to Bloomberg. Intel said it would address the matters in the letter with the senator. The company appointed Tan as CEO in March.\n\nOn Thursday, Intel stock sank 3.1% to close at 19.77.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Tan's connections to Chinese companies were well known before he took the Intel job. In a client note, he said Tan is \"a legend in the semi industry.\"\n\nTan took the Intel job because he has \"a deep-seated passion for Intel and a desire to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon,\" Rasgon said. \"He clearly wants to do what is best for Intel, and we suppose now he will have to ask himself whether or not resigning would best for them, especially with Trump's crosshairs on his back.\"\n\nSome analysts have speculated that TSMC or Broadcom could take over all or parts of Intel.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nSharkNinja Jumps On Strong Q2 Earnings, Raised Guidance\n\nSymbotic Stock Falls As Warehouse Automation Firm Misses With Outlook\n\nApple Stock: Time To Buy Or Sell?

SIMO’s trailing and forward P/E were 32.36 and 21.60, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nIs Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO) the Cheap Semiconductor Stock to Buy Now?\n\nAn engineer in a lab coat tweaking a circuit board with intricate semiconductors.\n\nSilicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO) is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in NAND flash memory controllers, which manage data storage between host systems and NAND memory. SIMO benefits from a capital-light model and outsources manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor. The company is positioned for significant growth through new product introductions targeting AI data centers (DCs), high-end PCs, and mobile markets.\n\nThe NAND market, currently near trough levels post-COVID, is stabilizing as AI-driven demand accelerates and competitors prioritize DRAM and HBM development, reducing NAND controller innovation and creating opportunities for SIMO. Industry consolidation has left SIMO, Phison, and Marvell as the main merchant suppliers, but SIMO’s focus on advanced controllers positions it favorably, especially as it enters new niches like AI DCs.\n\nKey growth drivers include Montitan, an enterprise SSD controller for AI data centers, which offers 14GB/s read/write speed at 40% lower power and uses cost-efficient QLC NAND. Montitan already has six design wins, including two tier-1 customers, and represents a multi-billion-dollar TAM. SIMO is also introducing PCIe5 controllers for high-end PCs, winning four of six major flash makers, and UFS 4.0 products for mobile, driving higher ASPs.\n\nAdditionally, SIMO is qualifying controllers for Nvidia DPUs, opening another high-margin segment. These innovations could boost EPS to $7 by 2026, implying $118/share upside with net cash versus ~$70 today, and potential for $175+ in a bullish scenario. The company also has $8/share cash, possibly rising to $13 if it collects a $160M breakup fee from MaxLinear. With catalysts including strong 2H25 results and potential settlement, SIMO offers asymmetric upside with limited downside risk.\n\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) by Stock Analysis Compilation in December 2024, which highlighted its leadership in high-growth semiconductor markets and strong R&D investments. The stock has depreciated about 2.62% since, as the thesis has not yet played out. The thesis still stands given robust industry trends. Motherlode shares a similar view but focuses on SIMO’s growth from AI-driven NAND controllers and new product launches.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:59:12.876924+00:00"}

The company's $600 billion commitment to building manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. is seemingly helping it gain favor with the Trump administration, but the big infrastructure push is also part of a broader dynamic that involves reducing reliance on Chinese manufacturing in response to geopolitical uncertainty.

The semiconductor fabrication leader's share price was up 5.3% as of 10:15 a.m. ET. At the same point in the daily session, the S&P 500 was up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%. The chip stock had been up as much as 7.1% earlier in the session.\n\nTSMC's valuation is roaring higher after the White House confirmed that the company will not be subject to a newly announced 100% tariff on semiconductors.

Given that TSMC is the far-and-away leader when it comes to contract semiconductor manufacturing services, the development suggests huge benefits for the company and also the broader semiconductor industry.\n\nBeing exempt from the new tariff should help keep TSMC's strong sales and earnings momentum alive and also strengthen it against competitors. While the company already holds a dominant position in the contract chip manufacturing space, the new tariffs will make it even harder for Samsung and other non-domestic chip fabricators to gain market share from TSMC.\n\nWhat's next for TSMC?\n\nTSMC has been posting very strong sales and earnings growth as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors and other chips for data centers has soared. According to some estimates, the company manufactures somewhere around 90% of the world's advanced AI chips -- and its fabrication technologies offer performance advantages that make it likely that the category leader will retain its command over the market for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs a result of its importance in the AI space and broader chipmaking capabilities, TSMC has taken on a high level of geopolitical importance. The company's exemption from the new chip tariffs stemmed from its moves to dramatically increase its U.S. manufacturing operations, and geopolitical dynamics will likely continue to be a key performance catalyst for the stock.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:59:27.900895+00:00"}

(NYSE:TSM) just hit an all-time high, climbing 4.89% to NT$1,180, after officials confirmed the chip giant won't be subject to a proposed 100% US tariff on semiconductor imports. The reason? TSMC's deepening roots in Arizona. The company recently boosted its US commitment to $165 billion, including three fabs, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center. Taiwan's National Development Council chief Liu Chin-ching said plainly: if you're building in the US, you're in the clear a message that echoed former President Donald Trump's own remarks about favoring companies that invest locally.\n\nThe market reaction was swift. Foreign equity inflows surged, pushing the Taiwan dollar up nearly 0.9% intraday and lifting the broader stock index by 2.4% outpacing regional peers. Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ, said investors had been on edge awaiting clarity on the chip tariff rate. With TSMC exempt, a major risk overhang may be off the table at least for Taiwan's most important stock, which now makes up close to 40% of the nation's benchmark index. The company's role in powering AI infrastructure worldwide only adds to investor conviction.\n\nOther chipmakers may not be as lucky but some could still find shelter. United Microelectronics is working closely with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which may soften the blow. Meanwhile, Samsung's Texas fab and Apple's US supply chain commitments put them in strong positions. Malaysia, another chip hub, is seeking clarity from Washington, though its prime minister said the impact could be limited given many of the firms operating there are US-based. The message for global chipmakers is becoming clearer: plant your flag in America or risk being priced out.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:59:31.521843+00:00"}

I'm not talking about finding stocks that can double in under a year, as there is more luck than anything in that approach. Instead, I'm looking for stocks that can double in under five years.\n\nThe rule of thumb is that the market doubles about once every seven years, so if a stock can double in five, it's a market outperformer. I think there are a handful of stocks that meet this threshold, and each looks like an excellent buy now.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and the Android operating system. However, the most important part of its business by far is Google Search. This division brings in over half of Alphabet's total revenue and has allowed Alphabet to fund various investments.\n\nBut Google Search is under attack. Investors are worried that Google Search will become a victim of generative AI and lose significant market share. While there is some anecdotal evidence that users are defecting from Google to generative AI, the vast majority of the population still uses Google Search.\n\nHowever, investors' fear of Google Search losing market share has caused the stock to fall to a cheap valuation. At less than 20 times forward earnings, Alphabet's stock is cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades for 24 times forward earnings.\n\nAlphabet's business is still growing, with Google Search's revenue rising 12% year over year in Q2 and companywide diluted earnings per share increasing 22%. Combined with Alphabet's cheap stock price, this makes the stock an easy candidate to double in under five years.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is a massive beneficiary of the AI arms race. TSMC is a chip foundry, which means it fabricates chips for companies that are unable to do so themselves. Considering there's only a handful of chip foundries globally, this makes TSMC a top competitor in an industry where there are few other options.\n\nThis cements TSMC at the top of a very important industry, making it a smart investment. It also has massive growth potential, as management projects revenue will increase at a nearly 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. A 20% CAGR over a five-year period results in a revenue gain of almost 150%, so this far exceeds the threshold needed to double in under five years.\n\nTSMC isn't as cheap as Alphabet, trading at 24.7 times forward earnings. However, that's nearly in line with the broader market, which reduces the overall risk of buying this stock today.\n\nAmazon\n\nAt first glance, Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) may not seem like a great candidate to double in five years, as its commerce platform is already dominant. However, that's not the Amazon story investors should be focused on.\n\nAmazon isn't a revenue growth story; it's a profit growth story. This is because Amazon's higher-margin divisions, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising, are growing much faster than the company as a whole. In Q2, Amazon's overall revenue rose 13% year over year.\n\nHowever, AWS saw sales rise 17% and advertising delivered an excellent 23% growth rate. With these two businesses growing much faster than the overall company, it means Amazon's profits will grow much faster, which is exactly what has happened over the past few quarters.\n\nAmazon's profit growth will drive it to double in under five years, and with the market's negative reaction to its Q2 earnings, it makes for an excellent stock to buy right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:59:37.518246+00:00"}

That comes on top of a previous commitment made in February, bringing the total to $600bn.\n\nThe pledge follows similar announcements from companies such as TSMC and Nvidia, who have promised to spend more in the US. Big Tech has already made collective commitments to invest about $1.5 trillion in the country since Trump moved back into the White House in January.\n\nNow the question is whether the deal brokered between Cook and Trump will be enough to insulate the millions of iPhones made in China and India from the tariffs that the administration has already imposed and reduce the pressure on the company to raise prices on the new models expected to be unveiled next month.\n\nWall Street seems to think so. After Apple's stock price gained 5% in Wednesday regular trading sessions, the shares rose by more than 2% in extended trading after Trump made his exemption announcement.\n\nThe shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia, which has also recently made big commitments to the US, rose marginally in extended trading to add to the $1 trillion gain in market value the Silicon Valley company has made since the start of Trump's second administration.\n\nDemand for computer chips has been climbing worldwide, with sales increasing 19.6% in the year-ended in June, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organisation.\n\nTrump's tariff threats mark a significant break from existing plans to revive computer chip production in the US that were drawn up during the administration of President Joe Biden.\n\nSince taking over from Biden, Trump has been deploying tariffs to incentivise more domestic production. Essentially, the president is betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs will force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up consumer prices.\n\nBy contrast, the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that Biden signed into law in 2022 provided more than $5bn to support new computer chip plants, fund research, and train workers for the industry. The mix of funding support, tax credits and other financial incentives were meant to draw in private investment, a strategy that Trump has vocally opposed.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:59:44.526418+00:00"}

This six-week period, where many of Wall Street's most influential businesses lift the hood on their operating results, provides investors with invaluable information.\n\nHowever, an equally strong argument can be made that the quarterly filing of Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission is just as important as earnings season. A 13F offers investors a way to see which stocks Wall Street's top money managers have been buying and selling. In other words, these filings clue investors in to the stocks, industries, sectors, and trends that have piqued the interest of highly successful asset managers.\n\nArguably no trend has been hotter than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Empowering software and systems with the tools to make split-second decisions without human intervention is a multitrillion-dollar global opportunity, which explains why AI stocks have soared.\n\nBut not all of Wall Street's prominent billionaire fund managers are along for the ride.\n\nBased on 13Fs filed in mid-May that detail first-quarter trading activity, Appaloosa's billionaire chief David Tepper has been a big-time seller of three red-hot AI stocks -- Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), or TSMC -- over the previous year. Curiously, though, Tepper has been loading up on another AI stock that somewhat recently joined the exclusive trillion-dollar club.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper has been a persistent seller of Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC stock\n\nTepper and his team tend to be fairly active and are regularly building up or reducing their existing stakes. Rather than looking at changes from the prior three-month period, more wisdom can often be gained by examining year-over-year changes to Appaloosa's more than $8 billion dollar investment portfolio.\n\nBetween April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025, Tepper oversaw a significant reduction in, or the complete exit from, three of the AI revolution's top companies:\n\nNvidia : 4,120,000 shares sold (93% reduction), which has been adjusted to account for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024.\n\n: 4,120,000 shares sold (93% reduction), which has been adjusted to account for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor : 230,000 shares sold (46% reduction).\n\n: 230,000 shares sold (46% reduction). Advanced Micro Devices: 1,630,000 shares sold (completely exited position).\n\nAll three of these companies have been successful in their own right within the AI arena. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the bulk of GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers, while AMD's Instinct series chips are slowly adding market share. Meanwhile, TSMC is the world's leading chip-fabrication company, with its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity rapidly expanding to satiate growing enterprise demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nIf everything is going to well for Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC, the question that has to be asked is: Why did billionaire David Tepper sell over a 12-month period?\n\nSimple profit-taking is one of the more logical answers. All three companies have seen their shares appreciate noticeably over the trailing-three-year period, and Tepper has demonstrated he's not shy about locking in gains. What's worrisome is there may be more to this persistent selling activity than just a desire to take some chips off the table.\n\nFor example, every next-big-thing technology since (and including) the proliferation of the internet in the mid-1990s has navigated its way through a bubble that eventually burst. In plainer English, investors continually overestimate the adoption rates and/or utility of game-changing technological advances. It's going to take time for AI to mature as a technology and for businesses to figure out how to optimize their solutions and generate a positive return on their investments. This suggests another bubble may be brewing.\n\nWhereas Taiwan Semiconductor is a diversified company that generates a meaningful percentage of its net sales from fabricating chips for smartphones, Internet of Things, and automotive, Nvidia and AMD are increasingly reliant on enterprise GPU orders. If an AI bubble were to form and burst, these two companies would be hit hard.\n\nValuation may have also come into play for Appaloosa's billionaire chief. Historically, industry-leading businesses thriving on the heels of a next-big-thing trend have topped out at 30 to 40 times trailing-12-month sales. Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 31, as of this writing.\n\nWith the stock market also historically pricey, Tepper may view Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC as being on shakier ground than their respective share prices would indicate.\n\nThis trillion-dollar AI stock is bucking the trend in Tepper's fund\n\nWhereas billionaire David Tepper has been an undeniable seller of artificial intelligence stocks over the trailing year, based on 13F filings, there's one trillion-dollar AI stock that's managed to buck the trend. During the March-ended quarter, Appaloosa gobbled up 130,000 shares of Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), which is one of only 11 public companies around the world to have ever reached a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nWhile Nvidia and AMD have locked down the lion's share of GPU market share in AI-accelerated data centers, Broadcom is the preferred choice for its host of AI networking solutions. Its products are capable of connecting tens of thousands of AI-GPUs in order to maximize compute capacity, as well as minimize tail latency. Put simply, Broadcom's hardware reduces lag, which facilitates the split-second decisions that need to be made by AI-empowered software and systems.\n\nBroadcom is also making a name for itself thanks to its custom AI chips. During the company's fourth-quarter conference call in late 2024, CEO Hock Tan opined that a few of its hyperscaler clients could spend anywhere from $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 (its fiscal year ends in late October or early November). As long as AI remains a hot trend, Broadcom is expected to be one of the more unstoppable stocks.\n\nBut what Appaloosa's Tepper might appreciate most about Broadcom is that it's much more than just an AI-driven company. While AI is, unquestionably, Broadcom's most meaningful growth driver at the moment, it has plenty of other channels that generate sales and positive operating cash flow.\n\nBefore AI became the hottest thing on Wall Street, Broadcom was known for its lead role in developing wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Even though smartphones aren't the growth story they were a decade ago, the ongoing expansion of 5G service globally provides a modest growth opportunity for Broadcom.\n\nIn addition, it offers an assortment of solutions for industrial product lines and automobiles, as well as owns an enterprise cybersecurity solutions division. The point being that if the AI bubble were to burst, Broadcom would, in all likelihood, be in better shape to navigate the coming storm than hardware giants Nvidia and AMD.\n\nLastly, Tepper may have found Broadcom's valuation more palatable than the likes of Nvidia. As of this writing on Aug. 5, Broadcom is valued at 35 times forward-year earnings, but appears to be sporting a sustainable annual growth rate of 20% or greater.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:59:53.283881+00:00"}

US futures rose while Asian tech stocks turned in a mixed performance. An exemption amounts to a major victory for Apple and Cook, who were bracing for substantial tariffs.\n\n“We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors, but the good news for companies like Apple is, if you’re building in the United States, or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge,” Trump told reporters.\n\nOn Thursday, Taiwan’s National Development Council Minister Liu Chin-ching said TSMC is exempted from the 100% US chips tariffs although some local companies will be affected. South Korean Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo told local broadcaster SBS that neither Samsung Electronics Co. nor SK Hynix Inc. chips would incur those levies. Both South Korean chip firms have pledged investments in the US.\n\nTrump’s surprise declaration further upends a global electronics supply chain undergoing a seismic shift following decades of reliance on China. Apple joined a parade of companies from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to Nvidia Corp. that have pledged to spend more than $1 trillion collectively since Trump’s ascension, seeking to assuage an administration keen to bring manufacturing back home. While much of the capital in those pledges represented prior commitments or longer-term plans, they appear to be working.\n\nThe US president announced his intentions from the Oval Office flanked by Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who unveiled plans to invest another $100 billion into domestic manufacturing. Any company that demonstrates a similar commitment would be exempt from tariffs on chips — though the White House will levy a separate tax on imports of electronics products from smartphones to cars that employ semiconductors.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump declared plans for a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports while promising to exempt companies such as Apple Inc. that move production back to the US, triggering a scramble among trading partners and companies worldwide to make sense of the threat.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSentiment has been “boosted by Apple’s $100 billion US manufacturing commitment and relief that Trump’s 100% chip tariff is unlikely to disrupt major supply chains,” said Billy Leung, a Sydney-based investment strategist at Global X ETFs. “TSMC’s alignment with US buildout plans, plus underpositioning in Apple, have helped support this bounce.”\n\nBut the bigger question may be Trump’s intentions when it comes to electronics, given the US is the world’s biggest market for consumer technology. The president has said he could unveil separate levies on all products containing semiconductor chips as soon as next week — in theory, that encompasses most everything from cars and appliances to clock radios.\n\nApple’s additional $100 billion US investment will include a new manufacturing program designed to bring more of Apple’s production to the US. Partners include glassmaker Corning Inc., Applied Materials Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.\n\nCorning will dedicate an entire factory in Kentucky to Apple glass production, increasing that company’s workforce in the state by 50%, the iPhone maker said. Corning was already a supplier to Apple, making glass for the very first iPhone at the same factory.\n\nApple had previously pledged to spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years, a slight acceleration over its prior investments and previously announced plans, adding about $39 billion in spending and an additional 1,000 jobs annually. The announcement will bring Apple’s cumulative commitment to $600 billion.\n\nThe previously planned $500 billion is said to include work on a new server manufacturing facility in Houston, a supplier academy in Michigan and additional spending with its existing suppliers in the country.\n\nUncertain Impact\n\nImplementation of Trump’s decision on tariffs — which he said he had not informed Cook of before the event — could have a massive impact on the tech industry.\n\nMany so-called chipmakers don’t actually own factories, preferring to outsource that function mainly to TSMC and, to a lesser extent, Samsung. Apple announced Wednesday that Samsung’s plant in Austin, Texas will supply chips to Apple as part of the new manufacturing program.\n\nWhile companies such as Nvidia — whose CEO met Wednesday with Trump — and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have touted their commitment to sourcing chips from TSMC’s new plants near Phoenix, there still isn’t enough advanced production outside of East Asia, let alone in the US, to meet their needs.\n\nNvidia, like Apple, has committed to spending large sums in the US and localizing procurement. But the company is still part of a complex supply chain that spans the globe and can’t easily be uprooted and replicated in the US.\n\nThe increased pledge comes as Trump escalates a tariff push that’s set to raise costs for Apple throughout its international supply chains.\n\nTrump plans to whack India — a key production market for Apple — with 50% tariffs, the first half of which takes effect just after midnight alongside a raft of other country-specific levies designed to reduce trade imbalances. The other half, to penalize India for buying Russian energy, will take effect later this month.\n\nCook, who attended the president’s inauguration and donated to his inaugural committee, has pushed for tariff exemptions for his company’s iPhones. Most iPhones sold in the US come from India, while the bulk of other products, including Apple Watches, iPads and MacBooks, are manufactured in Vietnam, which was hit with a 20% tariff.\n\nWhile details of those tariffs — and how firms would qualify for exemptions — have yet to be released, Trump singled out Cook’s Apple as an example of how to avoid the increased levies.\n\nApple’s promised investments, while substantial, fall short of the full shift to US-based production that Trump and top White House officials have envisioned and encouraged. Earlier this year, the president threatened to impose a tariff of at least 25% on Apple if it didn’t move manufacturing of the iPhone to the US, a day after he met with Cook at the White House.\n\nCook told the president that final iPhone assembly “will be elsewhere for a while,” though highlighted that several components are being made in the US.\n\nTrump, seemingly satisfied, praised the Apple leader’s plans.\n\n“Look, he’s not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world, not even close,” Trump said of Cook. “He’s coming back. I mean, Apple’s coming back to America.”\n\n--With assistance from Mayumi Negishi, Yian Lee, Miaojung Lin, Yoolim Lee, Edwin Chan, Debby Wu, Jennifer A.

For the first time, the cover glass for all iPhones and Apple Watches will be manufactured in the US, at Corning’s facility in Kentucky. Though Apple has touted the US roots of iPhone glass before, a portion of that glass was previously made overseas.\n\nStanding in the Oval Office on Wednesday between Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Cook announced that Apple will increase its US investment commitment to $600 billion over four years — up from the $500 billion pledged after Trump’s second-term victory.\n\n(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is using a familiar strategy to stay in Donald Trump’s good graces: expanding existing initiatives to show he supports the president’s “Made in the USA” agenda.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn all, the announcements provided just enough evidence that Apple was focusing on America — without forcing it to make major changes. Corning has supplied Apple since the first iPhone in 2007, and Cook has long promoted the iPhone’s American-made glass. What’s new is the modestly increased scale.\n\nApple is pointing to the deals as it seeks relief from looming tariffs. The Trump administration is letting exemptions on smartphone and gadget levies expire and adopting new duties on Indian imports — a potential issue for Apple, which recently shifted US-bound iPhone assembly to India.\n\nCook even seized on Trump’s famous love of gold. He presented the president with a large, circular Corning glass plaque engraved with the president’s name, mounted in 24-karat gold. The Apple CEO said that the glass came off an assembly line in Kentucky while the gold was produced in Utah. Cook added that a former US Marine who works at Apple designed the plaque.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, announced a major enticement: He said that companies investing in the US — even if the projects are in early stages — would get a break from some tariffs.\n\n“The good news for companies like Apple is, if you’re building in the United States, or have committed to build,” Trump said, “there will be no charge.”\n\nApple’s pledges are expected to meet that criteria, even if it isn’t actually making iPhones and other popular devices in the US. Assembly of the smartphone — a costly and complex process of combining components, testing and boxing devices — will continue in China and, increasingly, India.\n\nThat part will stay “elsewhere for a while,” Cook said. But “there’s a lot of content in there from the United States, and we’re very proud of it.”\n\nTrump acknowledged that assembly was “set up in other places, and it’s been there for a long time,” but he reiterated his desire to bring that stage of production to the US someday.\n\n“This is a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America,” he said.\n\nTrump’s existing tariffs have already taken a toll on Apple. It said last week that the levies will cost the company about $1.1 billion in the September quarter. But Apple is looking to avoid incurring further costs, especially as it prepares to unveil the iPhone 17 line next month.\n\nCook is also likely seeking support from Trump on other fronts: The US Justice Department is suing the company for alleged antitrust violations, and the agency is threatening its $20 billion search deal with Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOG) in a separate case. The US government also could potentially help Apple cope with tough new restrictions on the App Store in the EU.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Apple has used US manufacturing announcements to promote Trump’s priorities. In 2019, the company promised to assemble a new Mac Pro in Texas. It wasn’t a big change: Apple had produced the previous model in the state since 2013. But that gesture helped land the company a reprieve from tariffs.\n\nEarlier this year, after Trump’s return to office, Cook unveiled the initial $500 billion commitment — an acceleration of the investments Apple had begun under President Joe Biden. At that time, Apple announced it would start making AI servers in Houston.\n\nCook said Wednesday that the first test units rolled off that factory’s assembly line last month.\n\n“We’re going to keep building technologies at the heart of our products right here in America,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:59:59.245304+00:00"}

The tariffs, unveiled during a press conference at the White House with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Time Cook, will spare companies that are actively building or have pledged to build chip infrastructure within the U.S.\n\n“So in other words, we’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,” Trump told reporters. “But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge. Even though you’re building and you’re not producing yet... if you’re building, there will be no charge.”\n\nThis exemption would likely extend to a broad array of firms already announcing U.S. projects or expanding existing operations, regardless of whether domestic production is operational today. That interpretation seemingly offers protection to high-profile investments such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s $165 billion commitment in the U.S. or Samsung’s new foundry complex in Texas.\n\nThe news comes as Cook announced a $100 billion increase in Apple’s U.S. investment pledge, bringing its total to $600 billion over four years, including a wide-ranging American Manufacturing Program. “This includes new and expanded work with 10 companies across America,” said Cook. “They produce components that are used in Apple products sold all over the world, and we’re grateful to the President for his support.”\n\nShares of Apple soared on the news, rising 5.1% during the trading session and another 3.5% after hours as investors saw the company positioned advantageously against the backdrop of heightened trade barriers.

It's a crucial time for investors. There have been virtually no signs of artificial intelligence (AI) losing its momentum. While it's still early, some of the leading AI stocks have already reported outstanding results that solidify their prolific roles in AI's coming of age.\n\nThese three AI stocks have delivered impressive earnings results and still trade at compelling valuations, making them no-brainer buys right now.\n\n1. ASML\n\nDutch company ASML Holdling (ASML 2.81%) builds complex equipment systems that are crucial to manufacturing the high-end chips used in AI. As one might guess in this ongoing AI boom, the company reported stellar earnings results for the second quarter of 2025, surpassing Wall Street estimates in both sales and earnings. Yet, the stock has veered lower and now sits nearly 40% below its all-time high. So what's going on?\n\nASML's management issued very cautious guidance for next year, citing uncertainty related to tariffs and geopolitical trade tensions (export controls) that could potentially threaten ASML's ability to grow its business. But here's the thing: ASML is the only company in the world that produces extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which use highly concentrated UV light to etch patterns onto silicon.\n\nIf the world needs more and increasingly complex chips, that demand should trickle to ASML over time. That could be why analysts still anticipate ASML growing earnings by an average of over 17% annually for the next three to five years, even if management is erring to the side of caution for right now.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25 is a five-year low. In other words, ASML, a mission-critical player in AI infrastructure, is the cheapest it's been since the AI boom started.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%), continues to slump on concerns that AI models will continue to grow and eventually pressure Google's search engine advertising profits. While ChatGPT continues to swell in popularity, Google is doing just fine. Alphabet's Google ad revenue grew by an impressive 12% year over year in the second quarter. For now, at least, it appears that ChatGPT and Google can coexist profitably.\n\nThe stock isn't even down much, just 8% below its all-time high. Yet, it feels like Wall Street just isn't respecting the tech giant enough; shares trade at a P/E ratio of only 20, versus an average of nearly 30 over the past decade.\n\nInvestors who buy here have much to be excited about, and it spans well beyond the search engine business. Alphabet's Google Cloud is rapidly growing due to AI tailwinds, and the company's Waymo subsidiary is establishing itself as the leader in the autonomous driving space, as its ride-hailing service continues to expand into new markets.\n\nIn all, analysts have Alphabet slotted for nearly 15% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years, making the stock a bargain at just 20 times earnings today. Alphabet could outperform the market on growth alone moving forward, and could be a genuine game changer for your portfolio if sentiment improves and boosts the stock's valuation closer to its long-term norms.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nGlobal foundry behemoth Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) -- also known as TSMC --is the world's leading producer of semiconductors, and it continues to cement its status as a leading AI company and juggernaut in the broader tech space. Companies like Nvidia turn to TSMC to manufacture their AI chips, which has helped the company expand its market share to an estimated 35.3% in Q1 2025, up from 29.4% just a year ago.\n\nTSMC's AI momentum helped the company turn in a blowout second quarter. Research by McKinsey & Company estimates that companies will continue to invest in data centers over the coming years, with worldwide estimates projected to exceed $7 trillion over the next five years alone. All those data centers will need vast quantities of chips, which should keep TSM busy for the foreseeable future. Analysts estimate TSMC will grow earnings by an average of over 21% annually for the next three to five years.\n\nThe caveat with this stock is the geopolitical risk associated with TSMC's location in Taiwan, which has a long-standing dispute with China over the land's sovereignty. While an escalation of those tensions could impact TSMC's business, it's becoming hard to ignore the value here. The stock's P/E ratio is just 27, a bargain for the growth that investors anticipate from TSM moving forward. This makes Taiwan Semiconductor a strong buy for anyone comfortable with the geopolitical risks.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:00:06.389563+00:00"}

The stock has delivered a solid 17.7% gain year to date (YTD) and outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which rose 10.9%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock has also moved ahead of several chip peers, including ASML Holding ASML, ON Semiconductor ON and Marvell Technology MRVL. Shares of ASML Holding, ON Semiconductor and Marvell Technology have fallen 0.5%, 25.1% and 30.6%, respectively, YTD.\n\nYTD Price Return Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis outperformance shows investors remain confident in Taiwan Semiconductor’s long-term story, even during a volatile market shaped by trade conflicts and geopolitical risks. We believe this momentum is grounded in strong fundamentals, and TSM’s long-term outlook justifies a hold position for now.\n\nAI Boom: A Multi-Year Growth Catalyst for TSM\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor continues to dominate the semiconductor foundry space. TSMC is known for its advanced production capabilities and has already moved into 3nm production, with 2nm coming soon. Its large scale allows it to handle rising AI chip demand better than most competitors. The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom has placed TSMC at the center of a multi-year structural growth cycle.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has established itself as the preferred manufacturing partner for AI accelerators, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom silicon developed by major players like NVIDIA, Marvell Technology and Broadcom.\n\nIn 2024, AI-related revenues tripled, making up a mid-teen percentage of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s total revenues, and the momentum is far from over. TSMC expects AI-related sales to double again in 2025, with an impressive 40% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. This positions TSM as the undisputed backbone of AI-driven technological advancements.\n\nTo capitalize on the AI-driven growing demand for advanced chips, Taiwan Semiconductor is investing heavily in expanding production capabilities. The company is set to invest between $38 billion and $42 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, far outpacing its $29.8 billion investment in 2024. The bulk of this spending, around 70%, is focused on advanced manufacturing processes, ensuring TSM stays ahead of other chip manufacturing rivals.\n\nTSMC’s Resilient Financial Performance\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s latest earnings report highlights just how dominant the company remains. In the second quarter of 2025, TSM’s revenues surged 44% year over year to $30.07 billion, while EPS jumped 61% to $2.47. This growth was powered by the booming demand for its advanced 3nm and 5nm nodes, which now account for 58% of total wafer sales.

The Nikkei reported that multiple employees were fired for allegedly attempting to extract critical technical details. Meanwhile, Taiwan investigators also searched the local office of Tokyo Electron, a key Japanese supplier. That development adds another layer of complexity, as global players double down on chip R&D just as generative AI demand puts semiconductor capabilities under a microscope.\n\nFor investors, the timing is hard to ignore. Capital expenditures in chipmaking are pushing past $30 billion annually for giants like TSMC and Samsung (SSNLF), while rivals in ChinaHuawei and SMICare still producing at 7nm. In the U.S., Intel is progressing on more advanced nodes. With companies like Meta and DeepSeek pouring billions into AI infrastructure, TSMC's ability to safeguard its IP may become just as important as delivering next-gen performance. What happens next could ripple across the entire AI supply chain.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:00:18.568364+00:00"}

However, the specifics of these tariffs remain unclear.\n\nSuch tariffs could cause quite a disruption for U.S. hardware and AI companies. When the U.S. CHIPs and Science Act was signed in 2022 — providing $52 billion in subsidies to boost domestic chip manufacturing — the U.S. produced only about 10% of global chips. Despite this small manufacturing footprint, more than half of global semiconductor companies are headquartered in the U.S.\n\nSince then, some progress has been made toward boosting domestic chip manufacturing. Both Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) have received funding from the CHIPs Act. TSMC has also committed to spending “at least” $100 billion over the next four years on chip manufacturing plants in the U.S.\n\nBut setting up chip manufacturing plants takes time. Intel recently announced it was delaying construction on its Ohio chip manufacturing facility, again, highlighting the challenges of rapidly scaling up production.\n\nThe tariff announcement comes as the industry awaits the administration’s decision on AI chip export restrictions — rules that control which countries can purchase advanced semiconductors used in AI systems.\n\nThe Trump administration formally rescinded the Biden administration’s chip AI export rules in May. Those rules had established a country-specific, multi-tier approach to restricting chip exports based on national security concerns. The Trump administration then released its AI Action Plan in July, which emphasized the need for the U.S. to implement chip export restrictions but was light on the details of what that could look like.\n\nAccording to reporting from Semafor citing industry sources, the Trump administration is now debating whether or not it should go through with its plan to rescind and replace Biden’s AI export rules.\n\nFor more on the semiconductor industry’s tumultuous year, we’ve compiled a regularly updated timeline of market news since the beginning of 2025.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:00:24.356067+00:00"}

Companies also calculate yield in a variety of ways, which can make this critical data a moving goal post, the two people and two additional sources with knowledge of Intel's manufacturing operation said.\n\nThis percentage figure, known as yield, means Intel may struggle to make its high-end laptop chip profitably in the near future.\n\nYet only a small percentage of the Panther Lake chips printed via 18A have been good enough to make available to customers, said the two people, who were briefed on the company's test data since late last year. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because Intel did not authorize them to disclose such information.\n\nEarly tests disappointed customers last year, but Intel has said its 18A is on track to make its \"Panther Lake\" laptop semiconductors at high volume starting in 2025, which include next-generation transistors and a more efficient way to deliver power to the chip. The chipmaker has hoped that producing such an advanced in-house chip would grow external interest in its foundry, at a time when new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has explored a major shift to course-correct that fledgling business, Reuters previously reported.\n\nFor months, Intel ( INTC ) has promised investors it would increase manufacturing using a process it calls 18A. It spent billions of dollars developing 18A, including the construction or upgrades of several factories, with the goal of challenging Taiwan's chipmaking heavyweight, TSMC. Intel wants to round out its business designing chips that it largely makes in-house and TSMC helps it produce, with a contract manufacturing business that can compete with this key supplier. But whether Intel revives advanced chip production in the U.S. and gets its contract foundry on solid footing depends on closing the technology gap with TSMC.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -The production process that Intel hoped would pave the way to winning manufacturing deals and restore its edge in churning out high-end, high-margin chips is facing a big hurdle on quality as it puts newer technologies to the test, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIntel in the past has aimed for a yield north of 50% before ramping production because starting any earlier risked damaging its profit margin, three of the sources said.\n\nIntel typically does not make the lion's share of its profit until yields reach roughly 70% to 80%, key for a chip as small as Panther Lake where many defects would make it a tough sell, the three people said. Profit also flows from market expansions and building up factory output, Intel said.\n\nAn immense yield increase would be a tall task by Panther Lake's fourth-quarter launch, the two people with knowledge of Intel's manufacturing operation said. But without such a jump, Intel may have to sell some chips at a lower profit margin or at a loss, the two sources briefed on test data said.\n\nPanther Lake is \"fully on track,\" Intel said in its July 30 comment. Intel did not specify the yield threshold at which its chips become profitable.\n\nThe company has warned it could exit leading-edge manufacturing entirely if it does not land external business for 14A, which is 18A's next-generation successor.\n\n'HAIL MARY'\n\nIntel's 18A process involved big manufacturing changes and introduced newer technologies all at once, such as a next-generation transistor design and a feature that would improve the delivery of energy to a chip. This created manufacturing risks due to the complexity of fabricating chips, three of the sources said.\n\nIntel took on this challenge to close the performance gap with TSMC, but its aggressive timeline for a rollout of unproven systems set it up for failure, said the two people briefed on the company's test data. One likened the effort to a \"Hail Mary\" football pass.\n\nIn April, Intel said it had begun a crucial step toward printing Panther Lake chips via 18A known as \"risk production.\" The company also showed off several laptops it said used Panther Lake chips at the Taiwan Computex expo in May.\n\nBut problems have persisted.\n\nOne way chip manufacturers gauge progress is to measure the number of defects per area of a chip, which can vary based on a semiconductor's design. Relative to industry standards, the Panther Lake chips had about three times too many defects for Intel to start high-volume production, the two sources briefed on test data said.\n\nAs of late last year, only around 5% of the Panther Lake chips that Intel printed were up to its specifications, these sources said. This yield figure rose to around 10% by this summer, said one of the sources, who cautioned that Intel could claim a higher number if it counted chips that did not hit every performance target. Reuters could not establish the precise yield at present.\n\nIn the interview with Reuters, Zinsner disputed these figures and said \"yields are better than that.\" He did not give a number for July or late 2024, and Intel declined to provide this data.\n\n\"Our expectation is every month they'll get better and better, such that we're at a yield level that is good for production-level Panther Lake at the end of the year,\" he said, adding: \"I wouldn't say that margins are accretive even at those yield levels, so we still have to make improvement.\"\n\nTan has tapped supply-chain contacts more than usual for Intel and has given them data to help improve chip yields, Zinsner said.\n\nFor now, Intel remains partly dependent on TSMC to make its in-house designed chips. An Intel executive said in June that Nova Lake, a chip it is planning after Panther Lake, will be made partly on TSMC, too.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

It's the top producer of lithography systems, which optically etch patterns onto silicon wafers, and it serves all of the largest chip foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung and Intel.\n\nASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems are used to produce older and larger chips. It's also the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are used to produce the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips in the world.\n\nASML's monopolization of that technology makes it a linchpin of the semiconductor market. From 2014 to 2024, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 17%, its gross margin expanded from 44.3% to 51.3%, and its EPS rose at a CAGR of 22%. Over the past 10 years, its stock has rallied 610% and delivered a total return of 684% with its dividends.\n\nASML still seems like a sound long-term investment, but it's pulled back more than 30% from its record closing price of $1,085.93 per share last July. Let's see why its stock cooled off -- and if that pullback represents a compelling buying opportunity for patient investors.\n\nWhat happened to ASML over the past year?\n\nASML's net sales rose 14% in 2022 and 30% in 2023. That acceleration was driven by its rising shipments of DUV and EUV systems, the explosive growth of the AI market, stable service and upgrade revenue, and the gradual rollout of its newest high-NA EUV systems -- which are required to mass produce even smaller and denser chips (below the 2nm node) than its current low-NA EUV systems. ASML is barred from shipping its EUV systems to China, but it's still selling plenty of older DUV systems to Chinese chipmakers.\n\nBut in 2024, ASML's net sales only rose 3%, its gross margin stayed flat, and its EPS dipped 3%. Its growth cooled off as it lapped the AI market's initial growth spurt, its non-AI markets grew at a slower clip, and it was restricted from shipping some of its higher-end DUV systems to China. Its top customers also reined in their system upgrades.\n\nMetric Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Net Sales Growth (YOY) (9.5%) 11.9% 28% 46.4% 23.2% Bookings Growth (YOY) 23.7% 1.2% (22.8%) 9% (0.5%) Gross Margin 51.5% 50.8% 51.7% 54% 53.7% EPS Growth (YOY) (18.7%) 9.8% 31.5% 92.9% 47.1%\n\nBut in the first half of 2025, ASML's net sales rose by the double digits again as its gross margins expanded. That recovery was driven by AI tailwinds for the DRAM memory chip market, which offset a lot of the pressure from the unpredictable tariffs and tighter export curbs against China, and more upgrades to its high-NA EUV systems.\n\nFor the full year, ASML expects its net sales to rise 15% as its gross margin expands by nearly a percentage point to 52%. Analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow 14% and 24%, respectively. From 2024 to 2027, they expect its revenue and EPS to increase at a CAGR of 10% and 17%, respectively.\n\nWe should take those long-term estimates with a grain of salt, but ASML should dominate the crucial EUV market for the foreseeable future. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 25 times next year's earnings, it pays a forward dividend yield of 1%, and it will remain one of the most straightforward ways to invest in the secular expansion of the semiconductor market.\n\nTherefore, I think it's a great idea to accumulate more shares of ASML this year as the bulls look the other way.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:00:40.982650+00:00"}

Otherwise, you're better off just investing in an index fund (and there's nothing wrong with that).\n\nTwo stocks that I think can crush the market moving forward are Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%). Both offer investors excellent value and make for great purchases at these levels.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet may be better known by some of the companies under its umbrella: Google, YouTube, Waymo, and the Android operating system. Alphabet has a wide reach, but most of its business boils down to advertising, particularly on the Google Search engine.\n\nInvestors are worried that Google Search could be a victim of generative AI, as people may use alternative search engines or a full-on generative AI experience to gain information, just as they did on Google. Because Google wouldn't get that traffic anymore, it would see its ad revenue decline, dragging the stock down alongside it.\n\nHowever, the market has prematurely jumped to that conclusion. The stock is already cheap, trading at less than 20 times forward earnings, indicating that the market doesn't believe in Alphabet's future.\n\nYet Alphabet's financials don't back up that theory. In the second quarter, Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year. That doesn't sound like a dying business, especially when you consider that the first quarter's growth was 10%.\n\nAdditionally, management sees huge momentum from its AI search overview product, which integrates generative AI with a traditional search result. This product is monetized at a similar rate to a traditional Google Search, so Google Search's revenue will continue to rise if AI search overviews remain a popular feature.\n\nAlphabet's stock is cheap, and the company is delivering excellent results. Revenue rose 14% and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 22% in Q2. Few companies can provide the same growth and value that Alphabet does, making it an excellent buy now.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's leading contract chip manufacturer and provides manufacturing capabilities to companies that cannot do it themselves. Because there are relatively few semiconductor foundries worldwide, this makes nearly every advanced tech company a client of TSMC's.\n\nWith such a broad and important customer base, management can see the general chip demand years in advance. At the start of 2025, they made the bold projection that AI-related revenue would increase at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with overall revenue rising at nearly a 20% CAGR.\n\nFew companies Taiwan Semiconductor's size (it's the ninth-largest company in the world at a $1.2 trillion market cap) are delivering that level of growth, which makes it an intriguing stock to scoop up now.\n\nWhile it's not as cheap as Alphabet, it's still reasonably priced at less than 25 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's nearly the same price as the S&P 500, which trades for 24 times forward earnings.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is in an excellent position to continue growing over the next few years, and investors should feel confident scooping up shares now to capitalize on the booming chip market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:00:42.568315+00:00"}

A representative of SoftBank declined to comment.\n\nAt the heart of SoftBank’s AI ambitions is chip designer Arm Holdings Plc. Son is gradually building a portfolio around the Cambridge, UK-based company with key industry players, seeking to catch up after largely missing a historic rally that’s made Nvidia into a $4 trillion behemoth and boosted its contract chipmaker TSMC near a $1 trillion value.\n\n“Nvidia is the picks and shovels for the gold rush of AI,” said Ben Narasin, founder and general partner of Tenacity Venture Capital, referring to a concerted effort by the world’s largest technology companies to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to get ahead. SoftBank’s purchase of the US company’s stock may buy more influence and access to Nvidia’s most sought-after chips, he said. “Maybe he gets to skip the line.”\n\nSoftBank, which reports quarterly earnings Thursday, should’ve benefited from that bet on Nvidia — at least on paper.

The long-term outlook of the economy seems to be strong, and as more tariff deals get struck, the uncertainty about future tariff policy decreases.\n\nRegardless of what happens, I still think these three stocks are excellent choices to buy right now, as there are secular trends that can push them higher, beating the market along the way.\n\nNvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNvidia (NVDA 0.58%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) are benefiting from the same tailwind: data center buildouts. The demand for AI computing power is massive, which requires companies to heavily invest in data center infrastructure to meet the demand. Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for computing devices in these data centers, and any competition that arises will be directly compared to these units.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia recently got another boost with the announcement that the U.S. government will approve its export license for H20 chips, a product specifically designed to meet export regulations to China. The return of this market for Nvidia can't be overstated, as the second quarter of fiscal year 2025's forecasted revenue growth would have been 77% if it could have sold H20 chips in the quarter, instead of the 50% management guided for.\n\nLooking forward, Nvidia expects massive data center growth, citing one projection that expects data center capital expenditures to rise from $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028. That's huge growth and is a big reason why Nvidia is an excellent stock to buy right now.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor benefits from this same tailwind and is also Nvidia's primary chip supplier. Nvidia is a fabless design company, which means that it designs chips, then outsources production to a company like TSMC. I like Taiwan Semiconductor in addition to Nvidia because there are competing technologies with GPUs arising (namely custom-designed AI accelerators) that could be a challenge to Nvidia in the future. While Nvidia is still strong and all indications point toward impressive growth, Taiwan Semiconductor is a hedge against Nvidia losing market share, as it's highly likely that TSMC will still be the chip foundry for new technology.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's management team expects monster growth from its AI-related business, with revenue expected to rise at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. Companywide, it expects nearly 20% growth. That's huge growth, and the balance of investing in both Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia is an excellent way to generate strong returns.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is a competitor in the AI race, but it is also a target. Investors are worried that Alphabet's primary revenue driver, the Google Search engine, will be significantly disrupted by generative AI products. While there have been some instances of users switching to generative AI models alone, the vast majority of the population still uses Google, and the launch of AI search overviews helps bridge the gap between a full-on generative AI experience and a traditional Google Search.\n\nThis will likely be enough to keep Google on top, and its latest results support that claim. In Q2, Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year. That's an acceleration from Q1's 10% revenue growth, so it's fairly clear that generative AI hasn't caused significant headwinds toward Google's business yet.\n\nDespite that, Alphabet's stock still trades at a significant discount to the broader market.\n\nWith Alphabet at 21 times trailing earnings and 20 times forward earnings, the market isn't forecasting strong growth. Yet, Alphabet's diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose 22% in Q2, showcasing that the analysts are being far too pessimistic about Alphabet's future. With the S&P 500 index trading at 25 times trailing earnings and 24 times forward earnings, Alphabet trades at a deep discount to the market.\n\nAs a result, I think it's an excellent stock to buy here, as it represents a great trade-off between value and growth.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:00:55.555371+00:00"}

If you're looking to increase your AI exposure, then taking a look at these four is a great idea.\n\nAt the top of my list for best AI stocks to buy in August are Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%), Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%), and ASML (ASML 2.81%). These four have a great combination of growth and value.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has been the top stock of AI investing for a reason: Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the nearly universal computing equipment for training and running AI workloads. The demand for Nvidia GPUs is still quite strong, and it could get another growth catalyst in the near future.\n\nBack in April, the U.S. government revoked Nvidia's license to export to China the H20 chips that it had specifically designed to meet export restrictions. This was a huge blow to Nvidia's business, with Nvidia losing out on $8 billion in projected revenue from the $45 billion it had expected to generate.\n\nFortunately, Nvidia has reapplied for its export license and says it has assurances from the government that it will be approved. While this won't affect Q2 results (which Nvidia will report in late August), a restart of H20 sales to China should boost growth for the remainder of the year. This will give Nvidia's stock a strong boost, making it a smart stock to buy in August.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest chip foundry, and makes chips for companies like Nvidia that lack the capabilities to do it themselves. TSMC is winning business from other foundries, making it the clear leader in this space.\n\nIt has already reported Q2 results, which delivered impressive 44% year-over-year revenue growth in U.S. dollars. However, that's just the beginning.\n\nManagement expects that for the five-year period starting in 2025, it will deliver nearly a 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for revenue. With TSMC's stock trading at 25 times forward earnings, it's not that expensive right now.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet recently reported impressive earnings, with revenue rising 14% year over year and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rising 22%. Normally, that would cause a big tech company to be assigned a forward earnings multiple in the high 20s to the low 30s, but Alphabet doesn't receive the same respect as other big tech companies.\n\nIt trades for less than 20 times forward earnings, making it cheaper than the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.13%), which trades at 24 times forward earnings.\n\nThis cheap price tag is assigned to Alphabet's stock because investors are worried about Google Search losing market share to generative AI products. However, that hasn't surfaced. Google has integrated AI search overviews, which bridge the gap between a full generative AI experience and traditional search. Management stated that over 2 billion people have used this and that it has the same monetization as a traditional search.\n\nThere have been no signs of weakness with Google Search, as revenue rose 12% year over year in the recent quarter. This indicates that Alphabet is cheap for no solid reason, which makes it a great buy for August.\n\n4. ASML\n\nASML is probably the least known company on this list, but it may be the most important. ASML has a technological monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which chip fabricators (like Taiwan Semiconductor) use to lay the microscopic electrical traces on chips. Without ASML's machines, none of the AI tech we enjoy today would be possible.\n\nAs chip demand rises, so will demand for ASML machines. While management was a bit bearish on its 2026 outlook thanks to tariff concerns, the long-term trend is still positive for ASML, as it's clear that chip demand is increasing.\n\nASML is still slated to deliver strong growth over the next few years, and its fairly cheap 26 times earnings estimates price tag looks like a steal considering its dominant market position.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:00:58.971720+00:00"}

The benchmark S&P 500 index is currently up 8.6% so far (as of July 28).\n\nAmid this technology-driven rally, two leading AI stocks continue to be dominant presences in their respective niches. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (TSM 0.77%) shares are up 23.2%, while shares of ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) are up 3.9% so far in 2025.\n\nYou don't need boatloads of funds to pick a stake in these market-leading stocks. If you have $1,000 that you don't need to pay bills or for contingencies, investing in either of these stocks can prove to be a genius move in the long run. Here's why.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nThe complete dominance of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in advanced chip manufacturing, accounting for over 90% of AI chip manufacturing, has positioned it as the backbone of the global AI infrastructure. The company also accounted for 67.6% of the pure-play foundry market in the first quarter of 2025, significantly higher than the 7.7% share of the second-largest player, Samsung Foundry.\n\nTSMC manufactures semiconductor chips for virtually every major technology company, including Nvidia, Apple, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom. In fact, according to data from Boston Consulting Group, cited by J.P. Morgan, the U.S. purchases 92% of its advanced AI chips from the company.\n\nTSMC's prowess in advanced process nodes (chip manufacturing technology) has created a competitive advantage. The company's advanced process node technology enables it to mass-produce cutting-edge, smaller, and more powerful chips for AI use cases. Additionally, the company has announced plans to invest $165 billion in advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. This move is expected to help reduce over-reliance and geographic risks, as most of its manufacturing is currently concentrated in Taiwan.\n\nTSMC has also reported strong financial results for the second quarter. Revenue increased 44% year over year to $30 billion, mainly driven by strong demand for its 3 nanometer (nm) and 5nm node semiconductor chips in AI and high-performance computing applications. The company's non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) also increased by 67% to $1.48. Management now expects the company's 2025 revenue to increase by 30%.\n\nTSMC currently trades at a reasonable 23.5 times forward earnings. That looks particularly attractive considering that management guided for AI-related revenues to increase at a mid-40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years at the start of 2025. Hence, investors should consider buying a small stake in this high-growth stock now.\n\nASML Holding\n\nASML is one of the key technology companies driving the ongoing AI revolution. The company develops lithography equipment for semiconductor manufacturers, including TSMC, Intel, and Samsung Foundry, which enables them to manufacture the advanced semiconductors that are essential for high-performance computing and AI applications.\n\nASML's business spans two segments: Net System Sales, including Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) machines and Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) machines, and Installed Base Management, which involves services offered for the maintenance, upgrade, and security of ASML's installed systems.\n\nThe company's EUV platform is the preferred technology used worldwide to manufacture advanced chips (7nm and below). The company holds a near monopoly in EUV lithography and is the sole manufacturer of EUV systems globally. EUV systems use extreme ultraviolet light with a wavelength of just 13.5 nanometers, combined with mirrors, to print much smaller patterns required for advanced AI chips.\n\nUndoubtedly, EUV technology is more expensive for clients, but it has resulted in improved precision and fewer production steps in chip manufacturing compared to older methods.\n\nWhile EUV receives the most attention, the company's deep UV (DUV) systems remain a significant part of ASML's sales. DUV systems use deep ultraviolet light at wavelengths such as 157 nanometers, 193 nanometers, and 248 nanometers through lenses to print patterns on chips.\n\nASML reported strong Q2 financial results. Revenue totaled 7.69 billion euros ($8.9 billion), of which 2.3 billion euros ($2.66 billion) were EUV sales. While net system sales totaled 5.5 billion euros ($6.37 billion), installed base services generated 2.1 billion euros ($2.43 billion) in revenue. ASML is also profitable, generating 2.3 billion euros ($2.66 billion) in the second quarter.\n\nManagement now expects total net sales to increase by approximately 15%, with gross margin of 52% in 2025. This guidance seems achievable, considering the company had a 33-billion-euro backlog at the end of Q2. ASML is also committed to returning capital to shareholders, as evident from its aggressive share repurchases worth 5.8 billion euros in the first half of 2025.\n\nDespite the technological moat and robust financials, ASML trades at a reasonable 28.7 times forward earnings. That looks particularly attractive for a company whose earnings are forecast to increase by 24.4% in 2025.\n\nASML has pulled back almost 34% from its all-time high in early July 2025, due to growth uncertainties for 2026 stemming from macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. However, considering the company's monopoly in EUV technology and the accelerating AI-driven demand for advanced chips, investors should view this dip as an excellent entry point for buying shares.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:02.526491+00:00"}

While Intel remains committed to 18A—which will support its next three generations of products—canceling development of the next node, 14A, would mark a major twist. According to Bernstein analysts, the consequences for the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market would be significant, particularly for suppliers tied to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Intel accounts for 20–25% of logic foundry capex and 10–15% of total semiconductor capex. Lasertec Corp (TYO:6920) and ASML (AS:ASML) are among the most exposed, with Lasertec deriving an estimated 28% of revenue from Intel and ASML about 9%. “It is especially negative to Lasertec as Intel contributes a bigger part of its backlog,” analysts led by David Dai wrote, estimating about 40% exposure. High NA EUV adoption could also be delayed, as Intel was expected to be the first mover in that space. For materials suppliers, the benefits would skew toward TSMC’s (NYSE:TSM) ecosystem. Hoya, the sole EUV mask blank supplier to TSMC, could theoretically expand its market share to 100% if Intel exits manufacturing and AGC loses its role as Intel’s supplier. “Ibiden also has sizeable exposure to Intel but should be immune, assuming Intel continues advancing its backend packaging technology,” the analysts added. On the foundry side, TSMC stands to gain the most, with Samsung Foundry also well-positioned. “TSMC clearly will benefit if Intel turns fabless,” the team noted. They also added that Samsung (KS:005930) could emerge as a strategic alternative in leading-edge logic manufacturing. As for Intel, Bernstein sees a degree of desperation behind the announcement. “One semi-plausible thesis around this is that it is a cry for help to the administration coupled with a veiled threat,” the analysts said. Furthermore, they cautioned that Intel’s announcement could hurt its ability to attract major customers, especially if those customers begin to doubt the company’s long-term commitment to manufacturing. Ultimately, the decision, “while potentially necessary for Intel’s longer survival in some form, creates substantial disruption and uncertainty around both the business and the stock which it seems prudent to avoid,” Bernstein concluded. Intel shares dropped 8% on Friday after the company signaled a possible exit from chip manufacturing. CEO Lip-Bu Tan also announced plans to cut more jobs, halt construction on two planned facilities in Europe, and slow progress on a third in Ohio, effectively abandoning his predecessor’s strategy of investing heavily in new plants to regain manufacturing leadership.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:04.455416+00:00"}

Currently, several top-tier tech names are trading with forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios under 1 -- something that typically indicates a stock is undervalued relative to its growth. These aren't struggling companies, either. They are leaders in their fields with strong fundamentals, clear catalysts, and solid long-term upside.\n\nHere are five cheap tech stocks worth buying right now.\n\n1. Nvidia (PEG: 0.9)\n\nIt's rare to see the market's top growth stock also sitting in value territory, but that's exactly where Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) finds itself. With a forward PEG of under 0.9 and dominant market share in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, Nvidia remains one of the best long-term bets in tech. Despite the company's massive data center revenue growth over the past two years, there is still plenty of growth in front of the company.\n\nThe real differentiator for Nvidia is CUDA. Nvidia's early bet on building a software ecosystem around its graphics processing units (GPUs) has really paid off. Developers learned to code on CUDA, and tools and libraries were built around it, creating a powerful network effect that is hard to displace. This led the company to capture a staggering 92% share of the GPU market in Q1.\n\nNvidia isn't sitting still, either. The company has a huge automotive opportunity ahead and recently got approval to resume selling its H20 chips in China. The stock trades at a 41 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, but when you're growing revenue at a huge clip and have this kind of moat, the PEG ratio tells the real story.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (PEG: 0.6)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is one of the most important companies involved in the AI infrastructure buildout. And at a forward PEG ratio of just over 0.6, it's also one of the cheapest high-growth stocks in the chip space. TSMC is the AI arms dealer, manufacturing the world's most advanced chips for companies like Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Apple. It doesn't need to bet on a winner -- it manufactures chips for all of them.\n\nTSMC's process node leadership is unmatched. Chips made on 7-nanometer or smaller nodes now make up 74% of revenue, and its 3nm tech already accounted for 24% last quarter. If you plan to make advanced AI chips at scale, you basically need to use TSMC at this point. This has led the company to have strong pricing power as well.\n\nThis could be seen in the company's Q2 results, with revenue surging 44% to $30.1 billion. Geopolitical and tariff risk is real, but TSMC is actively mitigating it with global expansion into the U.S., Japan, and Europe. AI demand continues to explode, and TSMC expects AI-related revenue to grow at a mid-40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028. Trading at a forward P/E of under 25 times and a PEG well below 1, TSMC is a bargain.\n\n3. Alphabet (PEG: 0.8)\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) is a dominant tech company trading like its search business is going away. At 19.5 times forward earnings and a PEG of 0.8, the stock is pricing in more risk than reality. Search isn't dying -- it's evolving, and Alphabet is leading that evolution with AI Overviews, AI Mode, and its Gemini models.\n\nSearch revenue actually accelerated last quarter, growing 12% to $54.2 billion in Q2. Over 2 billion people are now using AI Overviews monthly, and the company says those features are increasing query volume globally. Meanwhile, its cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, is growing like a weed. Revenue jumped 32% to $13.6 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $2.8 billion. The company's tensor processing units are gaining traction, and its Ironwood chip gives it a leg up on inference costs.\n\nAlphabet is also building out its robotaxi business with Waymo, which is now live in multiple U.S. cities, and YouTube continues to deliver. Shorts are driving ad growth, and AI tools like Veo 3 are making content creation easier. It's even a leader in the emerging field of quantum computing with its Willow chip.\n\nAlphabet is still growing earnings and revenue at a double-digit clip and remains one of the most attractively priced AI plays in the market.\n\n4. Alibaba (PEG: 0.5)\n\nAlibaba (BABA 3.30%) is absurdly cheap, trading at just 14 times forward earnings and a PEG ratio around 0.8. That would be interesting on its own, but the company also has nearly 30% of its market cap in net cash and investments. It's a textbook value stock with multiple growth levers in place.\n\nAlibaba's AI story is quietly gaining momentum. Its Cloud Intelligence revenue jumped 18% last quarter, and AI-related revenue has now more than doubled for seven straight quarters. Apple even chose Alibaba's Qwen model to power Apple Intelligence in China, which was a major vote of confidence in its AI technology leadership.\n\nOn the e-commerce front, Alibaba's gross merchandise value is reaccelerating, and it is better monetizing its platform with a small software fee and a new AI marketing tool. Its 88VIP loyalty program is expanding, and one-hour delivery is becoming a meaningful differentiator. The company also expects its international commerce unit to turn profitable soon, which could be a major boost to margins.\n\nAlibaba has a lot of upside as its turnaround continues, but even if it stalls, the stock is so cheap that the downside looks limited.\n\n5. Salesforce (PEG: 0.3)\n\nSalesforce (CRM -0.53%) isn't typically considered a value stock, but perhaps it should be. With a forward P/E around 24 times and a PEG ratio of just 0.3, the stock is a bargain in the software-as-as-service (SaaS) space -- despite having a potential huge growth opportunity with AI agents.\n\nSalesforce's Agentforce platform already has 4,000 paying customers just a few quarters after launch, and the company is working to become the leader in agentic AI. These agents can automate tasks across sales, service, and marketing, which could significantly increase productivity and reduce costs. When combined with its Data Cloud solution -- now generating $1 billion in annual recurring revenue -- the offering becomes even more powerful as Salesforce aims to build a digital workforce.\n\nSalesforce is also rolling out a flexible, outcome-based pricing model for Agentforce to help drive adoption. It's a smart move that aligns costs with value and should help customers see a quick return on their investments. While there's execution risk, the company is already seeing early traction. At this valuation, Salesforce doesn't have to be perfect -- just good. If it hits on agentic AI, the stock could have a lot of upside.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:05.853274+00:00"}

He says they're too difficult to understand and often vulnerable to change. He'd rather own more predictable picks, which means he prefers investing in already-profitable companies with simple business models. This preference disqualifies many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks from becoming a Berkshire Hathaway holding.\n\nNot every technology stock, however, is the clichéd dot-com type of investment that Buffett has sought to avoid. A handful of AI stocks are arguably justifiable additions to Berkshire's portfolio based on their predictability, profitability, and of course, their potential upside.\n\nHere's a closer look at three such AI prospects that Buffett might actually approve of if given a closer look. They may be a good way of adding some AI exposure to your portfolio as well.\n\nArm Holdings\n\nOK, Arm Holdings' (ARM 0.83%) revenue and earnings may not be perfectly predictable from one quarter to the next. The company's top and bottom lines do reliably grow though, and it is reliably (and increasingly) profitable.\n\nBut what is it? This company is frequently categorized as a semiconductor stock, which isn't an inaccurate description. It's not a manufacturer in the same vein as Intel (INTC 5.59%) or Qualcomm, though. Rather, Arm only designs microchip architecture and then licenses this intellectual property to chipmakers that often outsource the production of these chips to a third-party manufacturer. For instance, Apple's (AAPL 1.09%) latest iPhone processors are based on Arm's chip architecture, but this particular silicon is actually made (per Apple and Arm's specs) by a company called Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), also known as TSMC.\n\nArm only collects a relatively small amount of revenue for every iPhone sold with its tech built into it. But since Arm incurs no production or distribution costs, this is high-margin revenue. Last fiscal year Arm Holdings turned $4 billion worth of sales into nearly $800 million worth of net income.\n\nGiven the technological prowess of outfits like Intel, Apple, and Qualcomm, it seems strange that they should rely on -- and pay -- a company like Arm for something as relatively common as chip design. But it actually makes a lot of sense for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, all of Arm's know-how is patented, so using it would be illegal even if it is a logical and intuitive solution. And second, Arm's solutions are actually superior, particularly when it comes to power efficiency. Its cloud-computing data center processors require up to 60% less electricity than comparable processors from rivals, for example, answering one of data center operators' biggest frustrations.\n\nThat's why Arm believes it could control as much as half of the data center processor market by the end of this year, up from only about 15% as of 2024.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing doesn't just make Apple's newest Arm-based iPhone processors. It manufactures high-performance chips for most of the major semiconductor names including Nvidia, Qualcomm, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom -- just to name a few. Indeed, analysts' estimates put TSMC's market share of global production of high-performance processors anywhere from 80% to as high as 90%.\n\nWhat gives? As it turns out, manufacturing computer processors is complicated and expensive. It's often easier and cheaper to punt this work to an organization with the experience, expertise, and capacity to make these chips than it is to try and do it yourself. Over the course of the past couple of decades, TSMC has emerged as the industry's premier contract manufacturer\n\nThis satisfies a couple of Buffett's most important rules for buying stocks. As he advises, look for proven, high-quality companies with a wide competitive moat. TSMC offers both.\n\nA handful of chipmakers are attempting to wean themselves from reliance on silicon made in the Pacific region particularly by TSMC. Back in 2022, for instance, Intel committed billions of dollars to establishing its own chipmaking foundries in Europe and the U.S.\n\nThe fact that much of this work has been delayed due to complications and recently scaled back, however, underscores the difficulty of getting into or expanding the chipmaking business when players like TSMC are already so well established and so far ahead, technology-wise. Apple's strategy is more aligned with reality. It's partnering with TSMC to establish a manufacturing presence within the U.S. that it can enjoy some control of and that won't simultaneously require it to fend off competition while these factories are being built.\n\nMore important to Buffett-minded investors, while the business may ebb and flow from time to time, the world's never not going to need new and better computer chips.\n\nDigitalOcean\n\nFinally, add DigitalOcean (DOCN 1.49%) to your list of undervalued and profitable AI stocks that Warren Buffett could appreciate.\n\nIt's probably the least-known name of the three AI prospects in focus. In fact, there's a good chance you've never even heard of it. Its market cap of less than $3 billion just doesn't turn many heads, and it's seemingly not nearly as critical to the AI industry as Arm or TSMC.\n\nDon't be dissuaded by its relatively small size or lack of recognition. It's arguably the most Buffett-like of all three AI stocks highlighted here.\n\nDigitalOcean provides a range of cloud-based services to clients that simply want to outsource their data center needs. These include blockchain solutions, simple web hosting, video streaming technologies, online video games platforms, and yes, a whole bunch of AI solutions like AI training, virtual customer service agents, and automated coding. Although DigitalOcean doesn't strictly serve the AI industry, AI is an increasingly bigger profit center.\n\nBut that's not what makes this outfit such a Buffett-esque pick. Rather, Warren Buffett would very likely fall in love with this stock due to the nature of its business model and the fact that it's reliably profitable. DigitalOcean's clients pay for access to its technological solutions on a predictable, monthly basis. As of Q1 of this year, its annualized recurring revenue run rate stands at $843 million (up 14% from the year-earlier comparison) versus 2024's total top line of $781 million, of which $84 million was turned into net income.\n\nAs long as the world needs the cloud -- and needs cloud-based AI solutions in particular -- this company's revenue and earnings are apt to grow in step with both industries.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:07.585880+00:00"}

If you bought AI stocks three years ago, you might have seen your stocks skyrocket, but you likely went through a real down period on the way. Consider how Amazon, Nvidia, and Palantir Technologies stocks performed in 2022.\n\nNow consider how they performed over that period and then onto the present.\n\nThe market has made a huge comeback, led by AI stocks. If you're looking for stocks that can still make you a millionaire, I think Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), Lemonade (LMND 4.24%), and Upstart Technologies (UPST 0.02%) all have tremendous upside and could be solid parts of a millionaire-making portfolio. Remember, there's no way to predict the future, and gains may not be linear, so you'll have to hold on through any dips.\n\n1. The chip king\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, is a foundry, which means it makes the chips that companies like Nvidia, Apple, and Advanced Micro Devices design. It's benefiting from tremendous tailwinds in AI, but since it works with so many clients in many different industries, its risk is well diversified. That gives it the best of both worlds.\n\nFor the time being, though, its AI segment is outperforming and driving growth. In the 2025 second quarter, revenue increased 35% year over year in U.S. dollars. The high computing segment, where the AI business falls, accounted for 59% of the total. TSMC is also extremely profitable, with a 58.8% gross margin and a 48.5% operating margin.\n\nManagement is guiding for sales to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 20% through 2029 and is targeting a long-term gross margin of at least 53%. To top it all off, Taiwan Semiconductor stock isn't expensive, giving it even more room to expand. It trades at a forward one-year P/E ratio of 22.\n\nLike any stock, the amount you invest, how it grows, and how long you can stay invested will determine whether it will turn you into a millionaire. But over time and with enough of a starting stake, TSMC stock could grow your money significantly and at least be a part of a millionaire-maker portfolio.\n\n2. The digital insurance revolution\n\nWhen Lemonade's founders were looking to start a new business 10 years ago, they hit upon insurance as one industry that was in vast need of a digital makeover. They created Lemonade, which is an all-digital insurance company that doesn't work with independent agents. It relies on AI throughout its enterprise, using chatbots to onboard and file claims, and AI and machine learning to price policies.\n\nToday, there are many insurance companies taking this leap, and the legacy insurers are all getting into AI. But having started at this a decade ago, Lemonade has a first-mover's edge and a decade of data and systems at the ready. It touts its interconnecting parts that all \"speak to each other,\" which companies that are more than a century old are having a hard time replicating.\n\nIt's growing at a rapid pace, with 2.5 million customers as of the end of the 2025 first quarter. In-force premium, the insurance industry's top-line metric, increased 27% year over year in the first quarter. The loss ratio, which measures how much of a policy is being paid out in claims, has declined and stabilized over time, which means the model is working.\n\nLemonade stock has been climbing recently, but it's still well off its all-time highs. It's expected to report profitability on an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) basis next year, following with positive net income in 2027. As it captures more customers and moves closer to net profits, shareholders are likely to be rewarded with huge gains over time.\n\n3. The AI answer to lending\n\nUpstart stock seemed like a dream when it became public a few years ago; it demonstrated tremendous growth, was highly profitable, and seemed like it could do no wrong. But it landed with a thud when interest rates shot up and its AI-powered platform wasn't able to identify as many good lenders.\n\nHowever, the business has persevered, and it has continued to develop strong algorithms that it maintains can approve more borrowers without increasing risk to lenders. As interest rates come down, its performance is improving, and the future looks bright.\n\nIn the 2025 first quarter, network volume increased 102% and revenue was up 67% year over year. Operating loss was $4.5 million, putting it into position to spring to positive very soon. For the full year, management is guiding for $1 billion in revenue, up from $637 million last year, and positive net income.\n\nAt the current price, Upstart stock, which had previously sported astronomical valuations, is now at more humble and attractive ratios. It trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 11 and a forward one-year a P/E ratio of 35. There may still be more volatility on the way, but at this price and with its opportunities, the stock now has much more room to expand, and if it continues to demonstrate high growth, it could be a valuable addition to a growth-oriented portfolio for risk-tolerant investors looking to become millionaires.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:09.264385+00:00"}

The Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, to which TSMC belongs, has gained 6.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, TSMC is expected to post earnings of $2.53 per share, indicating a change of +30.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.68 points to a change of +37.5% from the prior year.

This has caused an increase in the ADR premium’s trading range.”\n\nTSMC’s ADRs have historically traded at a premium for two main reasons.

The decline stemmed largely from a one-time inventory cost as US export controls led to unsold AI chips at its foundry business, which relies in part on Chinese demand. Samsung’s shares fell as much as 2.2% in Seoul following the announcement.\n\nIts overall net income came to 4.93 trillion won, missing estimates of 6.37 trillion won, while total quarterly capital spending slid about 7% from the previous quarter to 11.1 trillion won, with most of it allocated to its semiconductor business.\n\nDemand for high-end memory products for servers was solid and the company expects “meaningful expansion” in such advanced products in the second half of the year, executives said. The chips-to-smartphones company has shipped its bleeding-edge HBM4 samples to some of its customers, they added.\n\nSamsung’s HBM4 delivers twice the performance of earlier generation HBM3E with significant improvements in energy efficiency, Kim Jaejune, Samsung’s executive vice president for memory, told analysts on a conference call Thursday. The company will aim to ensure timely supply of HBM4 to meet the demand as it enters full scale, he said.\n\nBut analysts said Thursday’s grim results reflect Samsung’s poor performance on high-bandwidth memory. The company’s share of the global HBM market in terms of bit volume slipped to 17% in the second quarter, down from more than 40% in the first quarter of 2024, according to MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint.\n\n“This suggests that Samsung has fallen behind even Micron Technology Inc. to rank No. 3,” in the second quarter, he said.\n\nStill, Samsung executives presented a more positive outlook for the next six months, with Chief Financial Officer Park Sooncheol saying “earnings expected to improve steadily as the year progresses.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:26.608214+00:00"}

HBM, made up of stacks of DRAM memory chips (dynamic random access memory) used for short-term data storage, are essential for AI processors developed by companies like Nvidia and AMD.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung’s logic semiconductor business trails industry leader TSMC both in cutting-edge chip technologies and market share.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, SK Hynix overtook Samsung to lead the global DRAM market, while TSMC extended its dominance in logic chips with a 68% market share, compared to just 8% for Samsung, according to market research firm TrendForce.\n\nSamsung Electronics said July 8, it expected its second quarter operating profits to drop 56%, blaming US export controls on advanced AI chips to China. Jung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSanjeev Rana, head of Korea research at CLSA, a brokerage firm, said a series of “missteps” by Samsung – most notably management’s failure to anticipate the surge in AI demand – has contributed to its current struggles.\n\n“They were slow to recognize the coming AI revolution, and they bet on some other products, other technologies, which, in hindsight, didn’t turn out to be very good bets,” he said, explaining that Samsung overlooked the potential of HBM initially.\n\nAs a result, Samsung has so far missed out on being a supplier for its most advanced high-bandwidth memory product to Nvidia, which accounts for nearly 80% of global HBM demand last year, according to Rana. The product has repeatedly failed Nvidia’s performance tests, though he expects the company to clear them in the next two months.\n\nWhile Samsung announced in June that it managed to secure orders from AMD and Broadcom, rivals SK Hynix and Micron had already begun delivering samples of more advanced memory chips to customers.\n\nAt the same time, Samsung’s logic chip business – once central to its ambition to rival TSMC – is also under mounting pressure. Despite tens of billions of investments over the past few years, the company has been unable to secure meaningful orders for its advanced chips, leading to underutilized facilities, Rana said.\n\nLast year, CLSA estimated that Samsung’s contract chipmaking business posted an operating loss of 5.6 trillion won ($4.1 billion). That figure is expected to rise to 6.6 trillion won ($4.8 billion) this year.\n\nUS restrictions on the sale of advanced chips to China have also taken a toll on Samsung’s revenue, as shipments to Chinese clients and projects were forced to pause pending regulatory review, said Joanne Chiao, an analyst at TrendForce.\n\nBut with some chips now having cleared the review process, the second quarter is expected to be the most affected period, she added.\n\nA potential turnaround thanks to Tesla\n\nTesla offered Samsung a lifeline this week. Its CEO Elon Musk announced that the electric vehicle company has tapped the Korean chipmaker to make its new chips for self-driving cars and humanoid robots in a $16.5 billion deal.\n\n“Samsung’s giant new Texas fab will be dedicated to making Tesla’s next-generation AI6 chip,” he said in a post on X. “Samsung agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency. This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress.”\n\nSamsung’s shares surged more than 6.9% to reach their highest level since September following news of the deal.\n\nA general view of the Samsung Austin Semiconductor plant on April 16, 2024 in Taylor, Texas. The U.S. has awarded Samsung $6.4 billion to support the company's chip manufacturing plant in Taylor, Texas in an effort to help further generate domestic production of semiconductors, alongside expanding Samsung's manufacturing plants. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nTesla currently sources its AI4 chips, which power its advanced driver assistance systems called Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, from Samsung, but it enlisted TSMC to produce its AI5 chips, according to Musk.\n\nThe deal came after Samsung postponed the operational start of its chipmaking plants in Taylor, Texas to 2026 from its original schedule of 2024, as it struggled to win customers for the project.\n\nRay Wang, research director focusing on semiconductor industry at Futurum Group, called the deal with Tesla “significant,” saying it could boost Samsung’s struggling profitability and validate its capabilities in producing advanced chips.\n\nThe agreement will also help increase utilization of its Texas facilities, improving the company’s return on investment, he added.\n\nRana said that although mass production for the Tesla project won’t begin until 2027, the deal is a boost to market sentiment and represents “a big word of confidence.”\n\n“The management has done a lot of restructuring for this business in the last 12-15 months or so, so I think they now understand what the problems were, and they have made some efforts to resolving those issues,” he said. “Things will get better from the second half (of the year).”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:28.059433+00:00"}

As of the closing bell on July 25, 2025, its market cap had eclipsed $4.2 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world -- by a pretty wide margin, too.\n\nGiven these historic gains, it's not entirely surprising that for many growth investors, the artificial intelligence (AI) movement revolves around Nvidia. At this point, the company is basically seen as a barometer measuring the overall health of the entire AI sector.\n\nIt's hard to bet against Nvidia, but I do see another stock in the semiconductor realm that appears better positioned for long-terms gains.\n\nLet's explore what makes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) such a compelling opportunity in the chip space right now, and the catalysts at play that could fuel returns superior to Nvidia's over the next several years.\n\nThe AI infrastructure wave is just starting\n\nI like to think of the AI narrative as a story. For the last few years, the biggest chapter revolved around advanced chipsets called graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used across a variety of generative AI applications. These include building large language models (LLMs), machine learning, robotics, self-driving cars, and more.\n\nThese various applications are only now beginning to come into focus. The next big chapter in the AI storyline is how infrastructure is going to play a role in actually developing and scaling up these more advanced technologies.\n\nGlobal management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that investments in AI infrastructure could reach $6.7 trillion over the next five years, with a good portion of that allocated toward hardware for data centers.\n\nPiggybacking off of this idea, consider that cloud hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, along with their \"Magnificent Seven\" peer Meta Platforms, are expected to devote north of $330 billion on capital expenditures (capex) just this year. Much of this is going toward additional servers, chips, and networking equipment for accelerated AI data center expansion.\n\nTo me, the aggressive spending on capex from the world's largest businesses is a strong signal that the infrastructure wave in AI is beginning to take shape.\n\nThis is great for Nvidia and even better for TSMC\n\nRising AI infrastructure investment is a great tailwind for Nvidia but also a source of growth for Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, and many others.\n\nUnlike AMD or Nvidia, though, growth for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC for short) doesn't really hinge on the success of a particular product line. In other words, Nvidia and AMD are competing fiercely against one another to win AI workloads, which boils down to which of them can design the most powerful, energy efficient chips at an affordable price.\n\nThe investment case around TSMC is that it could be seen as more of an agnostic player in the AI chip market because its foundry and fabrication services stand to benefit from broader, more secular tailwinds fueling AI infrastructure -- regardless of whose chips create the most demand.\n\nThink of TSMC as the company actually making the picks and shovels that Nvidia, AMD, and other chip companies need to go out and sell while competing among one another.\n\nTSMC's \"Nvidia moment\" may be here\n\nThe valuation disparity between Nvidia and TSMC says a couple of things about how the latter is viewed in the broader chip landscape.\n\nCompanies such as Nvidia and AMD rely heavily on TSMC's foundry and fabrication services, which are essentially the backbone of the chip industry. While some on Wall Street would argue that Nvidia has a technological moat thanks to its one-two punch of chips and software, I think that TSMC has an underappreciated moat that provides the company with broader exposure to the chip industry compared to its peers.\n\nOver the next five years, I think use cases of AI development increase as businesses seek to expand beyond their current markets in cloud computing, cybersecurity, enterprise software, among others.\n\nEmerging applications such as autonomous driving and quantum computing will drive demand for GPUs and data center capacity even further. For this reason, TSMC may be on the verge of an \"Nvidia moment\" featuring prolonged, explosive growth.\n\nTSMC's modest forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 25 puts it in a unique position compared to Nvidia (with its forward P/E of 40) for considerable expansion as the infrastructure chapter of AI continues to be written.\n\nI think Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's valuation will increasingly become more congruent with the company's growth over the next several years, and so I predict that the stock will outperform Nvidia by 2030.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:29.965092+00:00"}

Over the last 10 years, the stock is down 26% even as many of its semiconductor peers and the \"Magnificent Seven\" have delivered monster returns.\n\nIntel's recent earnings report highlighted the company's multiple challenges as new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has embarked on a massive right-sizing campaign. The company has already laid off 15% of its workforce. It's spinning off its networking and edge business, turning Intel into a stand-alone company that can take on outside investment. It's also taken more impairments for equipment that's no longer useful.\n\nThat's all part of Tan's strategy of refocusing the business on core priorities like AI, its x86 CPU franchise, and the launch of a foundry for its 18A process.\n\nSome investors continue to bet on Intel's eventual turnaround, but the latest report shows that's likely to take longer than investors had hoped. Instead of buying Intel, investors are better off buying these two stocks that are capitalizing on the company's struggles.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nWhile Intel has struggled over the last decade, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%) has emerged as a winner, grabbing market share from Intel in the PC-focused client segment.\n\nIt's also proven itself to be more nimble, shedding its foundry business to become a fabless designer, and it's emerged as the closest challenger to Nvidia in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), though it's a distant second behind the leader. AMD has made several acquisitions of start-ups in AI to bolster its product offerings and make it more competitive.\n\nAMD is also growing much faster than Intel, showing it's capitalizing on the AI boom. It hasn't reported second-quarter results yet, but in its first quarter, revenue rose 36% to $7.44 billion, driven by its success in both the data center, where revenue jumped 57% to $3.7 billion, and in the client segment, where revenue jumped 68% to $2.3 billion on the strength of its Zen 5 Ryzen processors.\n\nBy contrast, Intel reported a 3% revenue decline in its client segment to $7.9 billion. As those numbers show, Intel is still the leader in PC chips, but AMD is rapidly gaining market share. The client segment is also Intel's biggest, making up nearly half of its revenue before intersegment eliminations.\n\nFinally, AMD is in a strong position because it has healthy franchises in both central processing units (CPUs) and GPUs, which should benefit it in the AI era.\n\n2. TSMC\n\nIn the foundry business, Intel's primary competitor is TSMC (TSM 0.77%), or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. In fact, it's not a close competition at this point as Taiwan Semiconductor makes up more than half of the contract chips in the world and roughly 90% of advanced chip production in the world, even manufacturing advanced chips for Intel.\n\nIntel has aspirations of challenging TSMC in the contract business, but at this point, the legacy chip maker is far behind, and it will take years for that strategy to materialize.\n\nIn the meantime, Taiwan Semiconductor continues to post blistering growth. In Q2, it reported 44.4% revenue growth in U.S. dollars to $30.1 billion, and profits have soared as well, as earnings per share jumped 60.1% to $2.47.\n\nThanks to its dominance of the contract foundry business and relationships with tech giants like Nvidia and Apple, TSMC enjoys huge operating margins, which came in at 49.6% in Q2. By comparison, Intel is struggling to turn a profit.\n\nTSMC now makes most of its revenue from advanced chips, which it defines as 7 nanometers (7nm) or less. That strength in advanced chips also positions it to continue to take advantage of growth in AI.\n\nConsidering its growth rate, TSMC's valuation also looks attractive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29. As rivals like Intel and Samsung have faltered, TSMC's leadership position has become even more dominant. The stock looks set to continue being a winner.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:35.105233+00:00"}

Wei, one of the business world’s most important people.\n\nWei took center stage in March, when he joined U.S. president Donald Trump in the White House to announce an additional $100 billion investment into TSMC’s Arizona operations. Wei then met Taiwan’s president Lai Ching-te after meeting Trump.\n\n“If someone had told me 10 years ago that I’d meet two presidents in one week to discuss hundreds of billions of dollars in investments to expand our global footprint, I would have thought they were joking,” CEO C.C. Wei told Fortune in written comments.\n\nOn this year’s Global 500, Fortune’s annual ranking of the world’s largest companies by revenue, TSMC rose 60 places to reach No. 126 on this year’s Global 500, following a 30% jump in 2024 revenue to reach over $90 billion.\n\nIt’s also the 13th most profitable company on this year’s ranking, earning $36 billion in profit, putting it ahead of Bank of America, Exxon Mobil and Toyota. And TSMC is one of just two non-Western companies to surpass $1 trillion in market value, alongside Saudi Aramco.\n\nTSMC joined the Global 500 in 2015, coming in at No. 472. It’s steadily climbed the rankings since then, overtaking its U.S. rival Intel in 2023.\n\nThe AI boom is set to propel TSMC even further. In its most recent quarter, TSMC’s revenue rose by more than 40% year-on-year to hit $30.1 billion. Sixty percent of its sales came from its high-performance computing division, which encompasses AI and 5G applications.\n\n“TSMC’s near-term outlook is especially strong, fuelled by robust AI demand and sustained capital expenditures from cloud service providers,” said William Li, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.\n\nWendell Huang, TSMC’s chief financial officer, says he expects AI to continue accelerating the company’s business, with a compound annual growth rate in the mid-40% range over the next five years.\n\nAnd while Huang is paying attention to growing consumer and enterprise use of AI, he’s also interested in a relatively newer development: “sovereign AI”.\n\nMany governments are now seeking more domestic control over the entire AI tech stack, including datasets, data centers, AI models and applications. The goal is to foster local development and reduce reliance on the U.S. and China, the current leaders in AI. Greater investment in local facilities will, in turn, drive demand for AI chips like Nvidia’s GPUs, and in turn boost the sales of chipmakers like TSMC.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:41.266074+00:00"}

But Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor could be better buys right now.\n\nShares of Palantir Technologies (PLTR 2.30%) surged 480% over the past year as the artificial intelligence analytics company's sales and earnings both jumped. Palantir's services are used by the U.S. government and companies to make sense of their data and make better decisions, and the company is likely still in the early innings of the AI boom.\n\nThat's the good news. The not-so-great news is that Palantir's rapid share price gains pushed its price-to-earnings ratio up to 690. That sky-high number is solidly in the nosebleed section of any stock valuation, and then some.\n\nWhile some investors may be OK with paying a hefty premium for Palantir's shares, many won't be. If you're one of them, here are two other AI stocks that are great to own instead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NVDA 0.58%) is at the top of many investors' lists of AI stocks, and with good reason. Nvidia is leading the way in the AI semiconductor space and the company's processors account for an estimated 75% to 95% of all artificial intelligence semiconductors. That lead won't be overcome any time soon, giving Nvidia a significant advantage in AI processing for years to come.\n\nWhat's more is that Nvidia's sales and earnings are through the roof. Data center revenue spiked 73% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 to $39 billion and the company's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings were up 33% from the year-ago quarter. Nvidia's management estimates revenue will climb 50% in the second quarter to $45 billion.\n\nNvidia stock is pricey, but it's far cheaper than Palantir's. The company's shares have a P/E ratio of about 56, which is on par with the rest of the semiconductor industry right now. And there are some solid indicators that more AI processor demand is on the way, considering that Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and others have all said they'll spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI data centers over the next several years.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), which is also called TSMC, makes the processors that many companies design. In contrast, Nvidia is a chip designer, not a fabricator.\n\nTSMC's business has been booming thanks to the surge in AI processor demand, and the company's management says that AI revenue will double this year compared to last year's sales. Considering the company's earnings surged 61% in Q2 2025, any investor fears that artificial intelligence demand is cooling down should be put to rest.\n\nLike Nvidia, TSMC is essentially unrivaled in what it does. The company makes an estimated 90% of the world's most advanced processors. And just as impressive is the fact that TSMC's stock trades at somewhat of a discount right now, with a P/E ratio of just 29, which is right at the S&P 500 index's average.\n\nHedge your AI bets\n\nWhile Palantir's shares could continue climbing, it's wise to spread out your investments across a handful of AI stocks. At times, it might seem like you're missing out on some of the gains that Palantir could make, but investing in some of the tangible parts of AI -- processors and manufacturing -- could be a good way to include a little diversification into an artificial intelligence-heavy portfolio.\n\nAnd given that fact that Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor have much more attractive valuations than Palantir, now could be a good time to start a position.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:01:58.488363+00:00"}

For Samsung, it’s a chance to finally carve out some market share from rival chipmaker TSMC. For Tesla, the deal could serve as the backbone for the lofty autonomous vehicle ambitions it has now staked its entire future on.\n\nPlay it Again, Samsung\n\nTesla is in trouble. Its second-quarter earnings report marked something of a disaster, with a 16% plunge in net income and a 12% drop in revenue failing to reverse a narrative that the company is rapidly losing market share both at home and abroad (not to mention rapidly losing lucrative carbon credits, thanks to a new regulatory environment). CEO Elon Musk, rarely one for humility, even copped to the gloomy outlook ahead. “We probably could have a few rough quarters,” Musk said. Still, he continued to sell a vision in which EVs are turning from a company cornerstone into a mere stepping stone to its most valuable form: one in which it becomes one of the world’s foremost purveyors of autonomous vehicles (AVs), as well as humanoid robots.\n\nTo achieve that future, Tesla says it needs to develop a next-gen “AI6” all-in-one chip that can power both its AVs and its humanoid robots. Enter Samsung. While Tesla is designing the AI6 chip itself, it’s returning to Samsung as a manufacturer; Samsung previously made Tesla’s AI4 chip, while TSMC has been pumping out the current-gen AI5. Consider it a massive win for Samsung, which may be in even bigger trouble than Tesla:\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Samsung’s share of global chip foundry revenue fell to 7.7% from 8.1% in the previous quarter, according to data from research firm Industry Tracker, as seen by The Wall Street Journal. TSMC, meanwhile, saw its leading market share increase to more than 67% in the first quarter.\n\nThe $16.5 billion would be the equivalent of nearly 8% of the company’s total revenue for 2024, though Musk said on social media that figure marked “the bare minimum” and “actual output is likely to be several times higher.” In a release Monday, Samsung said the deal will run through 2033.\n\nFresh Intel: The partnership marks what could be the second major win for Samsung in as many weeks. Key word: could. That’s because the company would theoretically benefit if fellow foundry also-ran Intel ultimately bows out of the chipmaking industry, a move apparently on the table, according to a Reuters report last week. According to Reuters’ sources, Intel’s continued presence in the space relies on the company securing a major US client.

The FDA said in a statement it \"will continue to work with the sponsor regarding non-ambulatory patients, which remains subject to a voluntary hold, following two deaths.\"\n\nJefferies analyst Andrew Tsai commented on the FDA’s decision, saying it \"significantly improves Elevidys' sales outlook in the near term.\" He added that \"[Wall] Street will feel relieved about the situation.\"\n\nThe company's stock had taken a hit last week after the death of an 8-year-old boy in Brazil. In response, Sarepta paused shipments of Elevidys for ambulatory Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy patients, allowing the FDA time to review safety data. However, after the FDA communicated its decision to lift the voluntary pause on shipments, Sarepta’s stock saw a sharp rebound in pre-market trading.\n\nShares of Sarepta, a developer of gene therapies for rare diseases, jumped over 50% ahead of the US opening bell, after closing 16% higher on Monday, as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave it the go-ahead to resume shipments of its key vaccine.\n\nNvidia’s H20 chip, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market, complies with US export restrictions and is less powerful than its more advanced AI models such as the H100 or the Blackwell series.\n\nAmid increasing demand, Nvidia has reportedly placed an order for 300,000 H20 AI chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSM ). This new order adds to Nvidia's existing inventory of between 600,000 and 700,000 chips.\n\nEarlier this month, in a pivotal move, the Trump administration reversed an earlier decision by lifting a ban imposed in April and allowing Nvidia to resume sales of its H20 GPUs to China. This decision, combined with reports of rising demand for Nvidia’s AI chips, has provided support to the company’s stock price.\n\nThe renewed optimism can be traced to growing expectations that the US may extend its trade truce with China by another 90 days. The original announcement has been a boon for Nvidia, whose fortunes have been closely tied to the evolving US-China trade relations.\n\nShares in the AI darling were trending in pre-market trading after finishing Monday’s session almost 2% higher as retail investors remain bullish on the stock.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nShares in Spotify were down slightly on Tuesday as the music streaming giant prepares to report its second-quarter 2025 earnings before the US market opens.\n\nAnalysts polled by Zacks expect Spotify to post $4.9bn in revenue for the quarter, reflecting a 20.3% increase year-on-year. Earnings are projected at $2.19 per share, representing a 53.2% jump from the same period a year earlier.\n\nInvestor sentiment has been buoyed by a combination of strong subscription growth, price increases, and a streamlined cost structure. Shares have risen approximately 120% over the past 12 months, rebounding sharply from 2022 lows, as enthusiasm builds around Spotify’s potential in AI-powered content recommendations and advertising innovation.\n\nEarlier this month, the stock reached an all-time high of $738.45, although it has since pulled back slightly.\n\nRead more: Barclays posts profit beat and announces £1bn share buyback\n\nLast week, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein upgraded his rating on Spotify from \"perform\" to \"outperform\", assigning a price target of $800. “We believe that SPOT will benefit from the secular tailwind of growing digital audio streaming adoption and that the company’s subscription economics are better than most believe,” Helfstein wrote in a note to clients.\n\nShares in AstraZeneca rose in London trading on Tuesday after the UK’s largest listed company by market value reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings and reaffirmed its full-year outlook.\n\nThe pharmaceutical group posted an 11% rise in revenues to $14.46bn for the three months to the end of June, surpassing analyst expectations of $14.15bn, according to a company-compiled consensus. Core earnings per share came in at $2.17, just above forecasts of $2.16.\n\n\"Our strong momentum in revenue growth continued through the first half of the year and the delivery from our broad and diverse pipeline has been excellent,\" CEO Pascal Soriot said in a statement.\n\nPre-tax profit for the period rose to $3.1bn from $2.4bn a year earlier, as AstraZeneca saw strong performance across key therapeutic areas, including an 18% rise in oncology sales.\n\nThe FTSE 100 (^FTSE) drugmaker, which derives 44% of its revenue from the US, is also ramping up investment in the country. Last week, it pledged to invest $50bn in the US by 2030, joining a wave of multinational pharmaceutical firms positioning themselves ahead of the potential imposition of tariffs on the sector by US president Donald Trump.\n\nSheena Berry, healthcare analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: “AstraZeneca continues to deliver strong growth, with its second quarter results showing solid rises in product sales, up 10% overall.\n\n\"This was primarily driven by 18% growth seen from the oncology portfolio, which has done well as a result of key drugs such as Imfinzi, Tagrisso and Enhertu. The group shows no sign of slowing down either with research and development spend increasing 18% in the quarter.\n\nRead more: Stocks to watch this week: Microsoft, Apple, Shell, AstraZeneca and HSBC\n\n“For now, 2025’s guidance has been reiterated with sales expected to increase by high single-digits and core earnings to grow by low double-digits. This remains a catalyst-rich period for the group with multiple positive phase III readouts and drug approvals in 2025 to date.\n\n\"The main pipeline update included in the results is the Avanzar lung cancer trial readout, which is now expected in the first half of 2026, rather than later this year as was expected. However, the long-term outlook remains attractive with the group making progress towards its target of $80bn in total revenue by 2030.”\n\nShares were down by 3% as Greggs reported a 14% drop in pre-tax profit for the first half of the year, as winter storms and summer heatwaves kept customers away from its high street shops, adding to an already challenging consumer environment.\n\nThe bakery chain, known for its sausage rolls and steak bakes, said profits fell to £63.5m in the six months to the end of June, down from £74.1m a year earlier. While total sales rose 7% to £1.03bn, the increase was not enough to offset a decline in margins and footfall.\n\nCompany-managed shop like-for-like sales rose 2.6%, while franchised locations grew 4.8%. Greggs, which operates more than 2,600 stores across the UK, said the decline in profits “reflected challenging market footfall and the phasing of cost headwinds that have particularly impacted the first half of the year.”\n\n“These challenges were compounded by heavy snow and strong winds in January and unusually hot weather in June, which had a material impact on consumer behaviour and lowered like-for-like sales,” the company said.\n\nMore than 200 shops in Scotland and Wales were temporarily closed during Storm Éowyn in late January, when a rare red warning was issued due to hurricane-force winds, heavy rain, and snow.\n\nCost inflation was also a factor, with overall cost pressures running at 5.4% in the first half. Full-year cost inflation is expected to be around 6%. Greggs spent £3m on expanding manufacturing, logistics, and technology capabilities, and completed 108 shop refurbishments, up from 81 a year earlier.\n\nChief executive Roisin Currie described the first half as a “challenging market” with weak consumer confidence. “People are saving, not spending,” she said.\n\nThe interim dividend was held steady at 19p. While full-year sales are expected to remain resilient, profits are forecast to come in “modestly below the level achieved in 2024”.\n\nMark Crouch, market analyst at eToro, said: “Greggs’ 14% drop in first-half profit caps a bitter 10 months for the UK's favourite baker.\n\n\"Management blames hot weather for weaker sales, but that doesn’t account for a 50% collapse in market value. The more plausible culprit is the timing of Greggs expansion strategy, stretching margins, just as the consumer picture turns more fragile.\n\n“Greggs has long been a reliable read on the UK high street. Its sudden stumble suggests consumers may not just be cooling on sausage rolls, but that appetite across the high street may be waning more broadly.\n\n\"With inflation easing and real wages recovering, the macro backdrop should, in theory, be supportive. That it isn’t showing up in Greggs’ numbers, is a red flag.\n\n“Greggs' brand still holds a strong place in the market, but scale isn’t helping if margins and volumes can’t keep up. The pressure is now squarely on management to regain the initiative, and not just blame it on the weather.”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:02:02.311704+00:00"}

But the green light hasn't come, and behind the scenes, it's triggering concern. Some officials in Washington and Taipei worry President Donald Trump may be holding back to preserve the optics ahead of a potential trade summit with President Xi Jinping. The timing matters: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's He Lifeng are meeting in Sweden this week to advance trade talks that could anchor a Trump-Xi dealone with real implications for markets.\n\nTaiwan, meanwhile, is walking a tightrope. Laialready under fire at home after an opposition power playnow risks looking weakened on the global stage. Adding to the tension, Taiwanese negotiators are in Washington trying to avert a 32% tariff on exports. And China? It's watching closely. Beijing has branded Lai a separatist and is likely to react if the trip goes ahead. Past transitslike former President Lee Teng-hui's 1995 visit to Cornellhave sparked military escalations. Even Lai's December layovers in Guam and Hawaii were followed by China's largest naval deployment in years. What looks like a layover on paper could turn into a flashpoint for global investors.\n\nAnd here's where things get especially sensitive for markets. The U.S. doesn't officially recognize Taiwan but is bound by law to supply arms for its defensean arrangement that's long underpinned regional stability. But any signal that Washington is reconsidering its support could rattle supply chains and companies exposed to cross-strait tensions. Trump has already shown a willingness to revisit tech curbs on Chinaraising questions about whether Taiwan becomes a trade chip. That's a risk for players like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), whose fortunes are tied to a fragile geopolitical balance.

The plan is for an upcoming plant in Taylor, Texas, to produce Tesla’s next-generation AI6 chip, Tesla chief Elon Musk said on X, confirming a Bloomberg News report.\n\nSamsung’s Seoul-traded shares rose 6.8% to their highest since September, while its suppliers like Soulbrain Co. jumped 16%. Tesla’s stock rose more than 1% in early US trading. A Samsung spokesperson declined to comment, citing confidentiality terms in its contract.\n\n“The strategic importance of this is hard to overstate,” Musk, 54, wrote on X. He described the value of the deal announced by Samsung as “just the bare minimum. Actual output is likely to be several times higher.”\n\nThe Tesla chief executive officer and X owner will walk the chip fabrication line himself and has been authorized by Samsung to assist in optimizing production, he said. The AI6 component will form the foundation of Tesla’s driving hardware suite for cars in coming years. Samsung produces the current AI4 system, according to Musk.\n\nThe contract win, the first after Executive Chairman Jay Y. Lee was cleared of all outstanding legal charges, comes as Samsung has been steadily losing ground in chip manufacturing. The company, which makes its own memory chips and also fabricates semiconductors on behalf of clients, has had difficulty bringing in enough orders to fully utilize its foundry capacity. It has postponed completion of construction and operational ramp-up of its new Texas fab to 2026.\n\n“Their foundry business has been loss-making and struggling with under-utilization, so this will help a lot,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. “Tesla’s business may also help them to attract other customers.”\n\nThat’s in contrast to leading chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which still cannot meet all demand.

Normally, investors don't expect these large companies to produce outstanding growth, as the larger a business gets, the more difficult it becomes for it to grow. However, TSMC has monster growth projections on the table, as well as a new technology that could drive shares much higher.\n\nRising from today's $1.25 trillion valuation to a $3 trillion valuation would require a 140% return. However, management believes there's plenty of growth in store for Taiwan Semiconductor to meet this threshold.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's new chip technologies will push its stock higher\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's leading semiconductor foundry. Its business strategy is to offer its clients best-in-class chip production technologies, and not compete against them. This business model has worked out incredibly well for TSMC, and its customer list ranges from Nvidia to Apple to Tesla. If you have a cutting-edge technology device, it's likely that it contains a chip manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nOne of the reasons TSMC established itself at the top of its industry is its dedication to driving the next greatest innovation. In recent chip launches, Taiwan Semiconductor outpaced its peers by offering the most advanced technology available first. That doesn't seem to be changing, as it has some promising technology in the pipeline.\n\nLater this year, Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to launch its N2 chip node, indicating 2nm (nanometer) spacing between traces. The pre-launch demand for the N2 node exceeds that of the 3nm and 5nm offerings. This is big news for Taiwan Semiconductor, as the improvements this generation offers are substantial enough that many companies are designing their products around this new technology.\n\nThe biggest improvement the N2 offers its users is energy efficiency. This has implications for the smartphone industry, with longer-lasting phones being more desirable. Additionally, the energy consumption of AI computing devices to run generative AI prompts is becoming a front-and-center topic. When N2 chips are configured at the same processing speed as 3nm chips, they consume 25% to 30% less energy. That's a massive improvement, and the energy savings from these chips may warrant upgrading to new computing units.\n\nBeyond its N2 launch, the company is slated to bring its A16 chip (1.6nm) to market in 2026. The A16 is expected to achieve an energy consumption improvement of 15% to 20% on top of the N2. A14 is the next technology TSMC is working on, but it won't reach production until 2028, so there's quite a bit of time between now and the scheduled launch date.\n\nStill, these technologies will drive further growth for TSMC and potentially propel it to a $3 trillion valuation mark in a fairly short timeframe.\n\nTaiwan Semi's management projects monster growth over the next five years\n\nManagement projects that, starting with 2025, its revenue will rise at nearly a 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. However, management has exceeded its own guidance every quarter this year, so it shouldn't surprise investors to see this projection increase.\n\nShould TSMC grow its revenue at a 20% CAGR, that would indicate nearly 150% growth, above the threshold needed for TSMC to rise to a $3 trillion valuation point. Additionally, Taiwan Semiconductor isn't an expensive stock, at least compared to the broader market.\n\nAt 24.6 times forward earnings, TSMC is only slightly more expensive than the S&P 500, which trades at 23.8 times forward earnings.\n\nWith a reasonable price tag and a fairly clear growth strategy, I think Taiwan Semiconductor is about as no-brainer a stock pick as it gets in today's market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:02:38.775325+00:00"}

Let's run through these, my friend. Sure.\n\n00:04 Speaker A\n\nWe'll go through three of them, rapid fire, right? One, you talk about here, here's the first Kevin theme, the long game of artificial intelligence and besting. You call out Taiwan semi, which has that it's it's up around 20% this year. I know some on the street, they worry about tariff impact, demand being a risk this year, but walk me through how you think about that there.\n\n00:25 Kevin\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, the largest dedicated chip foundry in the world with a 60% market share. You know who their largest client is? Nvidia. Everyone thinks Nvidia makes their own chips. They don't. Taiwan Semiconductor makes their chips. They just lifted their full year guidance by 30%, and we also know that Nvidia is looking to onshore the production of their chips into the US. Taiwan Semiconductor has a facility in Phoenix, Arizona. I've visited it. It's massive. Taiwan sector's got more room to grow.\n\n00:59 Speaker A\n\nAnd into your point, I mean, it's customer list, it's just a who's who of tech. Uh, the other one I'd like to talk about, increased investment in defense and security. Why is that a theme? How do you want to play it?\n\n01:08 Kevin\n\nSo start, we recently learned that NATO countries have committed to spend up to 5% of their GDP on defense spending over the next decade. We know that the European Union is going to spend $840 US billion US dollars over the next four years on defense spending. President Trump just included nearly $1 trillion in defense spending in the US budget. Where does that money go? Defense contractors. Here's an international play. We know international is outperforming US thus far this year, significantly. One name to play, BAE Systems, the largest defense contractor in Europe and one of the six prime contractors to the US Department of Defense. They pay a dividend about 1.7%. If you're looking to follow the money, the money's going into defense spending and BAE system is one way to play that.\n\n01:50 Speaker A\n\nWould you want BAE instead of or in addition to a Lockheed Martin? In addition. In addition to. This gives you some geographical diversification. You mentioned North of Grumman. How about a company like Kratos Defense, which is building autonomous warfare so you don't have to put soldiers' lives at risk in war. So there's different ways to play where this money's going to ultimately be spent, but BAE gives you a little geographical diversification as well. Yeah.\n\n02:26 Speaker A\n\nLast one I want, look to sources of power to help power your returns. Which what's the name there?\n\n02:32 Kevin\n\nHow about Nisource? It's a multi-utility. It's one of the largest distributors of natural gas in our country with over 3 million customers in states such as Pennsylvania and even Virginia. Virginia which has become the capital data centers of the world. So now utilities have become a back door play into the AI revolution. And A Nisource has a dividend over 2%, nearly 3%. So you get the defensive characteristics of utility, the back door play into the AI revolution, and as the energy secretary says, natural gas is where we need to lean into right now to help power the AI revolution going forward in addition to nuclear and other alternative sources. Yes.\n\n03:12 Speaker A\n\nI just you're in good company, by the way. Street agrees with you. I'm just looking at 80% of analysts covering this name say it's a buy, Kevin.

GitLab is helping transform the software development lifecycle.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/27/5-breakout-growth-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-for/", "published_at": "2025-07-27T16:05:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Investors looking for long-term winners should focus on companies with strong growth runways, clear competitive advantages, and the ability to adapt to evolving tech trends.\n\nLet's look at five breakout growth stocks that fit this bill that you can buy now and hold for the long term.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NVDA 0.58%) is the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI workloads, and it's hard to overstate the company's dominance. It captured an incredible 92% market share in Q1, and even at a $4 trillion market cap, Nvidia is still in growth mode.\n\nIts real moat isn't just its chips -- it's its CUDA software platform. CUDA is the main reason why the company is in the position it is in today. Nvidia pushed its free software platform into research labs and universities well before AI went mainstream. This led to developers being trained on CUDA, and tools and libraries being built on top of it that improve its chips' performance in handling AI tasks.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, recently got good news when the Trump administration indicated it would once again let it sell its H20 chips in China. The company is also pushing into new markets beyond AI, with the auto segment being another potential huge market with the advent of autonomous driving and robotaxis. As such, Nvidia remains a great growth stock to own for the long haul.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is the world's leading chip foundry, and its importance just keeps growing. Today, most advanced chipmakers just design chips, leaving their production to TSMC. That includes top names like Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Apple.\n\nTSMC is benefiting from the AI surge, with high-performance computing (HPC) now making up 60% of its revenue -- up from 52% a year ago. The company is far ahead in advanced node manufacturing, and that lead keeps widening. Nodes refer to how many transistors can be fit on a chip, and the more dense a chip is, the more powerful and energy efficient it becomes. Chips built on 7-nanometer and smaller nodes made up 74% of TSMC's revenue last quarter, with 3nm chips accounting for 24%.\n\nWith other foundries struggling, TSMC is the clear leader in the space due to its scale and technological expertise. As a result, it has been an invaluable partner to top chip designers. The great thing is that it doesn't matter which company takes market share, as they all use TSMC. With AI demand continuing to grow and new markets like autonomous driving emerging, TSMC looks like a cornerstone stock to own for the next decade.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nOne company looking to win the AI battle is Meta Platforms (META 3.16%). Meta already owns one of the most powerful digital ad platforms in the world, and it is now using AI to supercharge it. Meta's Llama models are helping boost engagement across Facebook and Instagram, which means users are spending more time on the apps, leading to more ad inventory to sell. At the same time, its AI tools are helping advertisers build better campaigns and target users more precisely, leading to higher ad prices and stronger return on ad spend.\n\nBut the biggest opportunities are still ahead. Meta is only just beginning to serve ads on WhatsApp and Threads. WhatsApp has more than 3 billion users, and Threads already has 350 million. Both are early in their ad rollouts, and that gives Meta a long runway for growth.\n\nMeanwhile, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is spending aggressively to secure AI talent, with a stated goal of delivering \"personal superintelligence.\" That's a bold vision, but if Meta succeeds, it could become the most important AI platform in the world. That's a reason to own it for the long term.\n\n4. GitLab\n\nGitLab (GTLB 1.24%) is transforming itself from a code repository into a full-blown software development lifecycle platform. Its platform now provides tools for planning, coding, testing, securing, deploying, and monitoring software, as it looks to become a single platform for the entire software development lifecycle. And it's doing this just as AI is fundamentally changing how code is written, tested, and deployed. Software development has been accelerating due to AI, and GitLab is becoming a key partner.\n\nGitLab 18 marked a big leap forward, with over 30 new features including Duo Agent, which allows AI agents to help across the full development lifecycle. That matters, because only about 20% of a developer's time is spent actually writing code. GitLab is now focused on helping drive efficiency everywhere else.\n\nIn an AI-first software world, GitLab's position as an end-to-end workflow solution puts it in a strong spot. This looks like a strong growth story with a lot of upside potential in the years to come.\n\n5. Toast\n\nToast (TOST 1.97%) is growing in importance in the restaurant industry, as its software platform helps restaurants manage operations and drive sales. Meanwhile, the company is now integrating AI into its platform in a way that could meaningfully change how restaurants make decisions.\n\nTools like ToastIQ and Sous Chef are helping restaurants make smarter, faster decisions in real time -- whether it's optimizing staffing, adjusting menus, or helping improve supply chains. It has even started piloting new modules to help restaurants upsell customers and improve their advertising with Google.\n\nToast's value proposition is clear: It helps restaurants run better and make more money. Meanwhile, through its payment processing, it benefits when its customers succeed. As restaurants face rising costs and tighter margins, they're turning to tech to help, and Toast is becoming one of the first places they look. That said, the restaurant industry is large and fragmented, giving Toast plenty of room to continue to expand over the next decade.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:02:46.919576+00:00"}

Three that I've got my eye on are Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%), Adobe (ADBE 1.37%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%).\n\nAll three of these trade at a hefty discount to the broader market, yet are still quite promising. If you're looking for value in the AI space, this trio is an excellent starting point.\n\nHow do these three fit into AI?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the best-positioned of this trio. It's the primary chip fabricator for some of the leading tech companies, including Nvidia and Apple. Its chip production facilities fabricate chips that its customers have designed, placing TSMC into a neutral position in the AI race.\n\nIt performed phenomenally well over the past few years, with revenue in U.S. dollars rising an astounding 44% in the second quarter, which exceeded expectations. This strength is expected to persist for many years. Management guided at the start of 2025 that it expects its revenue to increase at nearly a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. Taiwan Semi is a key player in AI technology, and it holds an enviable position.\n\nAdobe makes leading graphics design tools that are the industry standard. Whether it's video editing or image creation, Adobe is a top option. However, investors are growing increasingly concerned that generative AI creation technologies could displace Adobe. Image and video creation using generative AI models has come a long way, and has reached a point where it's nearly indistinguishable from what humans create. As a result, many are forecasting the downfall of Adobe.\n\nHowever, I think that's a bit premature. Adobe has also invested heavily in generative AI and has its own Firefly product that allows seamless integration of AI with its existing editing tools. This allows Adobe to compete in this realm while also giving creators more control over the end product than what many generative AI models do. This could keep Adobe relevant within the graphic design industry, making the forecast of its downfall somewhat inaccurate.\n\nCurrently, Adobe is performing well and has posted consistent revenue growth over the past few years.\n\nIf Adobe is supposed to be getting displaced, don't tell it that, as it's still growing at a healthy pace.\n\nLast is Alphabet, the parent company of the Google Search engine. Its stock is running into the same fears as Adobe's, as investors worry that generative AI will replace Google Search. While some have made the switch, investors need to remember that Google is an ingrained habit among internet users around the globe. It would take a massive technological leap, which most users won't need anyway, to get them to switch.\n\nGoogle has already implemented the popular AI search overviews feature, which seamlessly integrates search results and AI, and that could be enough to maintain the vast majority of its dominant market share. If Google Search can maintain most of its market share, the stock is poised to move higher, as it trades at a significant discount to the broader market.\n\nHow cheap is this trio?\n\nAlphabet's stock trades at a deep discount to the broader market, despite strong results.\n\nConsidering that the S&P 500 trades for 23.8 times forward earnings, this seems like a reasonable price to pay for the upside that Alphabet provides.\n\nAdobe is similarly cheap, trading for 18 times forward earnings.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is actually more expensive than the broader market at 25 times forward earnings. However, it's expected to grow at essentially double the pace of the market over the next five years, so this slight premium to the market seems a bit low. As a result, I'm confident labeling Taiwan Semiconductor as a bargain buy right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:02:50.691688+00:00"}

As we approach Aug. 1, the date when many reciprocal tariffs take effect, the entire economic landscape could shift. Although deals are being announced, many questions remain regarding their impact.\n\nHowever, there is one company that stands out by saying it hasn't seen any effect: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%). Taiwan Semiconductor's CEO C.C. Wei stated on its Q2 conference call that they \"have not seen any change in our customers' behavior so far\" regarding tariffs.\n\nThis is a significant development for TSMC, but does it suggest that the rest of the market is overreacting to tariffs?\n\nSemiconductors aren't subject to reciprocal tariffs\n\nThere are a few key points to understand regarding tariffs and semiconductors. First, semiconductors are currently exempt from all reciprocal tariffs. Additionally, they're excluded from the base 10% blanket tariff.\n\nHowever, that could shift as the Aug. 1 reciprocal tariff date arrives. If those tariffs are implemented, other goods could be subject to higher tariff rates than semiconductors. This means investors need to be cautious about drawing conclusions about how tariffs are being applied to one industry versus another. Still, it shows that the end users of products with their chips in them aren't slowing down purchases.\n\nA second critical factor is Taiwan Semiconductor's unique position within the chip industry. There aren't many choices when it comes to chip foundries with high-end technology. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has failed to launch many of the cutting-edge chip nodes, and low chip yields have plagued Samsung. This leaves TSMC at the top of the high-end semiconductor fabrication pyramid, making it a critical partner for tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAs a result, these companies are somewhat compelled to deal with the tariffs rather than seeking an alternative. But this is only temporary. TSMC is working to avoid tariffs by accelerating the build-out of its U.S. chip production facilities in Arizona. This will allow U.S. clients to avoid any tariffs on foreign goods.\n\nWhile Taiwan Semiconductor may not be experiencing any effects from tariffs, investors need to be cautious about drawing conclusions from its experience to the broader market. It's in a unique position that essentially requires its clients to deal with any tariff levies that come up, but it's actively working on increasing U.S. chip production capabilities to sidestep any tariffs.\n\nWith TSMC's strong position, the company also becomes an intriguing stock to consider, as few companies hold a more powerful position than TSMC.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor looks like an excellent buy at these prices\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's bull case is fairly straightforward: Its clients will use more chips and increasingly advanced chips over the next few years. This seems like a no-brainer investment thesis, and management's bold five-year growth projections back it up.\n\nStarting with 2025, management projects that AI-related revenue will grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with total revenue increasing at nearly a 20% CAGR. That's easily market-beating growth, yet Taiwan Semiconductor's stock trades at nearly a market-average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's 24 times forward earnings is nearly identical to the S&P 500's (^GSPC 1.13%) 23.8 times forward earnings. However, with market-beating growth expected, this makes the price well worth paying, and I think Taiwan Semiconductor's stock looks like a great buy right now due to its projected growth, reasonable price, and strong position in the chip fabrication industry.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:02:52.270504+00:00"}

On top of that, practically every business in the world is looking at how to integrate AI into its operations to improve workforce productivity and expand its addressable markets.\n\nTwo companies have recently seen their stock prices head higher on optimism about the future growth in AI spending. Palantir Technologies (PLTR 2.30%) shares are up 93% from their April low, as of this writing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is up 67% in that same period.\n\nBut after their stellar runs over the last three months or so, Wall Street has differing opinions on the two stocks. One is still a buy at its current price, but the other is a sell based on median price targets from analysts. Considering analysts are generally a bullish bunch, a median price target below the current price of a stock is typically a bad sign.\n\nPalantir has a median price target of $110 per share based on 27 analyst ratings. That implies a downside of 26% from its price as of this writing.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has a median price target of $275 per share based on 48 analyst ratings. That implies upside of 17% from its price as of this writing.\n\nHere's what investors need to know.\n\nPalantir: Growing fast and profitable, but 26% downside\n\nPalantir is one of the biggest beneficiaries of advancements in AI capabilities over the last 20 years. Its software helps government agencies and enterprises collect and make sense of massive data sets using machine learning algorithms, improving operational efficiency and decision making. With the advent of generative AI, Palantir developed its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which enables users to interact with its software using natural language and create agents for interacting with data.\n\nAIP has helped expand Palantir's use cases and addressable market, making it easier for new users to come on board. As a result, the company has seen its U.S. commercial revenue skyrocket over the last two years. It climbed another 71% year over year in the first quarter. Overall revenue growth came in at 39%.\n\nOn top of that, Palantir is exhibiting strong operating leverage. By focusing on product improvements and letting the product sell itself, Palantir has seen its adjusted operating margin expand to 44% in the most recent quarter.\n\nThe future looks bright for Palantir as well. It closed 139 deals worth more than $1 million in the first quarter, which led management to raise its full-year outlook for revenue and operating profits. But investors were ultimately disappointed with management's revised outlook, indicating there are already extremely high expectations for the company based on the stock price.\n\nIndeed, Palantir shares currently trade for approximately 90 times expected revenue over the next 12 months. That's not just expensive, that's astronomically pricey. Its forward P/E above 200 makes it, by far, the most expensive stock in the S&P 500. It's no surprise that many analysts expect the stock price to come back down as even a strong performance above analysts' expectations would still mean the stock is expensive.\n\nTSMC: An industry giant with huge AI-driven upside\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), is the biggest chip fabricator in the world. It commands about two-thirds of all spending on chip manufacturing, and that share continues to grow larger as demand for high-end AI chips drives the market.\n\nTSMC's ability to maintain and grow its massive market share stems from its leading technology. That attracts the biggest customers designing the most advanced chips in the world, including Nvidia and Apple. And with such a huge revenue base relative to other chip manufacturers, it's able to reinvest more in R&D to ensure its technology remains best in class.\n\nTSMC's next-generation technology, its 2-nanometer node, is expected to fetch premium prices relative to its current 3-nanometer node. Management is already seeing strong demand for it, expecting \"the number of new tape-outs for 2-nanometer technology in the first two years to be higher than both 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer in their first two years.\" TSMC should be ready to start volume production for that node in the next few months.\n\nDemand for high-end chips has exceeded management's expectations, leading it to raise its full-year revenue growth outlook for the business to 30% instead of mid-20%. Moreover, the order volume of its most advanced nodes has also led to higher gross margins, which came in at 58.6% last quarter. With premium pricing planned for the next-generation process, TSMC should be able to maintain those high margins over time.\n\nEven after the strong increase in stock price over the last few months based on its terrific operating results, TSMC stock trades for just 24 times forward earnings expectations. With strong revenue growth and its ability to maintain its extremely high gross margin, that may still be a bargain for the stock. Wall Street analysts seem to think so, with all but two analysts giving it a buy or equivalent rating.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:02:55.942503+00:00"}

The company, commonly known as TSMC, reported second quarter results on July 17, only to remind the market why it is one of the best ways to capitalize on the growth in AI semiconductor demand.\n\nAll the major chip companies, such as Broadcom, Marvell, Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, have been using TSMC's fabrication plants to manufacture their AI chips. Moreover, the chips that go into AI-enabled smartphones are manufactured at TSMC's facilities since it counts the likes of Qualcomm and Apple as customers too.\n\nThis world-class client base and the secular growth of the AI chip market allowed TSMC to deliver outstanding Q2 results and boost its full-year guidance as well. Take a closer look at the latest numbers, and you'll see why it's not too late for investors to buy this hot AI stock.\n\nTSMC's AI-fueled growth is here to stay\n\nTSMC reported an impressive 44% year-over-year increase in its Q2 revenue to $30.1 billion, exceeding the high end of its guidance range. Meanwhile, the company's adjusted earnings per share shot up at a much faster pace of 61%, a testament to its solid pricing power.\n\nTSMC controls 68% of the global semiconductor foundry market, well ahead of its closest rival, Samsung, which has a market share of just under 8%. The company has managed to build such a huge gap over the competition thanks to the technological lead of its process nodes. As a result, TSMC has the ability to raise the prices of its services, and that explains why its gross margin increased by more than five percentage points last quarter from the prior-year period.\n\nImportantly, TSMC is now anticipating its full-year revenue will grow 30% in 2025, up from its earlier estimate of mid-20% growth. But TSMC could end the year with an even bigger top-line jump as it has already achieved 40% year-over-year growth in the first half of 2025, and it is expecting a 38% spike in revenue in the current quarter (at the midpoint of guidance).\n\nWhat's worth noting here is that TSMC says its guidance takes into account the potential impact of tariffs on its business. Even then, the company has raised its full-year outlook, and it won't be surprising to see it end 2025 with a bigger-than-expected jump in revenue and earnings. In fact, TSMC's red-hot growth seems sustainable for a long time to come, considering the secular growth opportunity presented by AI.\n\nThe various AI-focused end-markets that TSMC serves are on track to boom remarkably in the next five years. For instance, the investment in AI chips and computing hardware could exceed a whopping $3 trillion by 2030, according to the consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts are also increasing their estimates for the company's earnings through 2027.\n\nThe stock is built for more upside\n\nTSMC stock has jumped an impressive 59% in the past three months. Even then, it is trading at 28 times trailing earnings as compared to the tech-laden Nasdaq 100 index's average earnings multiple of more than 32. The forward earnings multiple of 24 is even more attractive and is yet another signal of the company's continued bottom-line growth.\n\nInvestors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolios should consider buying TSMC as a top pick. It has room to run higher and is trading at a discount to the broader technology sector, despite quarter after quarter of outstanding execution.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:02:57.697668+00:00"}

The company said it has begun identifying strategic investors, without naming them. CRN previously reported on the plan.\n\nIntel’s woes have previously spurred speculation that it might be acquired or broken up, though there’s no clear path to a major deal. Possible suitors for Intel’s factory division, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., have backed away from the idea. Tan also has said he aims to keep Intel’s manufacturing and product-design businesses together, though he does plan to offload smaller divisions.\n\nThe crux of the concern: If Intel stops introducing new manufacturing technology, it’s bowing out of the race for leadership of the chip industry — and closing the book on what made it untouchable for decades.\n\n“The idea you might step away from 14A if you can’t get someone to invest in it is a problem,” said Wedbush Securities Inc. analyst Matt Bryson.\n\nThe company will add large-scale capacity for 14A when Tan is convinced he has enough customers committed to using it, he said on the call. That didn’t sit well with investors, who sent the shares down to $20.70 in New York on Friday, the stock’s biggest single-day decline in more than three months.\n\nAt the same time, Tan struggled to give a clear picture of how he’ll make the company more competitive again. Gelsinger had embarked on an ambitious plan to turn Intel into a chip foundry, a business that makes products for outside clients. A key part of that was moving toward a more advanced production technique called 14A. But Tan signaled Thursday that Intel will only roll out that technology tentatively.\n\n“I do not subscribe to the belief that if you build it, they will come,” he said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nAs part of Intel’s second-quarter report, Tan said the company will cancel some factory projects and take a more conservative approach to future spending. Tan called the investments begun under his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, excessive and unwise.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Intel Corp. tumbled 8.5% on Friday after Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan sparked concerns that he was more focused on cost cutting than restoring the chipmaker’s technological edge.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn its earnings report, Intel gave an upbeat third-quarter sales forecast while missing estimates for some profit measures. Margins will be tighter than Wall Street anticipated in the period, and Intel only expects a break-even quarter. Analysts had projected a 4-cent gain on that basis.\n\nIn the second quarter, revenue amounted to $12.9 billion, little changed from a year earlier. Analysts had projected $11.9 billion. The company posted a loss of 10 cents a share, compared with an estimated profit of 1 cent.\n\nIntel’s stock had been up 13% this year through Thursday’s close. Though that gain was in line with most chip stocks in 2025, rivals Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have performed better — lifted by their artificial intelligence prospects.\n\nTan’s focus is getting Intel’s financial house in order, a task that has included thousands of layoffs and the slashing of capital spending. The company said Thursday that already-paused factories in Germany and Poland won’t go ahead, and progress at another project in Ohio will be slowed.\n\nIntel will reduce capital expenditures on new plants and equipment this year and plans to make further cuts to that budget next year. The company will spend about $18 billion this year and less in 2026, executives said.\n\nTan, who took the CEO job in March, acknowledged that he still has work to do to make the company more competitive in its main markets: processors for personal computers and servers. He’s also still crafting Intel’s plan to crack the AI chip industry — an area where Nvidia dominates.\n\nTariff Effect?\n\nThird-quarter sales will be $12.6 billion to $13.6 billion, Intel said. Analysts on average had projected a number at the low end of that range.\n\nThe company has benefited from a resurgence in the PC industry, driven in part by manufacturers’ efforts to build up inventory before tariffs hit. But the Silicon Valley pioneer has lost market share to rivals and is struggling to attract foundry clients.\n\nIntel’s layoff plans — first announced during the previous quarterly report — will reduce staff by 15%, Intel said. And the company expects further cuts through attrition and the splitting off of business units, Chief Financial Officer Dave Zinsner said in an interview.\n\nThe chipmaker aims to end the year with 75,000 employees, down more than 20% from the end of the June quarter. Bloomberg News reported in April that Intel was looking to cut its workforce by roughly that amount.\n\nAnalysts have expressed concern that PC demand will decelerate after a strong first half. The threat of tariffs imposed by the US — and other nations in retaliation — may have prompted PC makers to rush to stock up ahead of prospective cost spikes, the company warned last quarter.\n\nEconomic Fears\n\nDemand was better than expected last quarter because an economic slowdown didn’t materialize, Zinsner said. But the company is aware that some demand might have stemmed from consumers and businesses trying to avoid tariffs.\n\n“We felt like tariffs might be a headwind in the second quarter and would further unsettle the economy,” he said. “None of that transpired.”\n\nIntel’s client computing division had revenue of $7.9 billion last quarter, topping the average prediction of $7.3 billion. Data center sales were $3.9 billion, compared with a $3.7 billion estimate. The foundry division generated revenue of $4.4 billion, in line with projections.\n\nIntel had previously said it planned to cut operating expenses to about $17 billion this year and $16 billion in 2026. The Santa Clara, California-based company remains on track for the 2025 cuts, Intel said Thursday.\n\nTan’s predecessor, Gelsinger, had concentrated on expanding Intel’s factory network, once its key competitive advantage. He laid out plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on making its plants the best in the industry again, a status that would force rivals to use it as an outsourced provider of manufacturing.\n\n“We will take a fundamentally different approach to building our foundry business,” Tan said in a memo to staff Thursday. “Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon – without adequate demand. In the process, our factory footprint became needlessly fragmented and underutilized. We must correct our course.”\n\nFor now, the biggest user of its factories is Intel’s internal design teams. Some of Intel’s best offerings now contain components made by TSMC, adding more pressure to its margins.\n\nNarrower Margins\n\nAdjusted gross margin — the percentage of sales remaining after excluding the cost of production — was about 30% in the second quarter and will be 36% in the current period. That’s close to half of what it was when Intel’s chips dominated the data center market. Nvidia has margins above 70%.\n\nIntel’s Zinsner said the company isn’t yet ready to unveil AI-related gear. The chipmaker is focusing on the development of products that will fit in unserved parts of the market.\n\nUltimately, Intel needs to figure out how it can benefit from artificial intelligence, Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note.\n\n“A fundamental market truth isn’t going away,” he said. “Global demand for AI chips continues to soar, and Intel must find its footing in that value chain.”\n\n(Updates shares starting in first paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:03:04.603303+00:00"}

Let's explore the Q2 report from TSMC (as the company is known for short).\n\nFrom there, I'll dive into some broader industry trends to help explain why the company's latest quarterly result was so impressive, and more importantly, how it is set up for even further growth in the long run.\n\nTSMC just posted a monster quarter all around, and...\n\nTSMC is a major supplier for leading chip companies such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom. Moreover, the company's reach extends beyond traditional semiconductor businesses since it has also forged strong relationships with tech giants Apple and Amazon.\n\nDuring the second quarter, the company generated more than $30 billion in sales, thanks in large part to continued robust demand for the company's 5nm and 3nm chip nodes.\n\nWhile the company's revenue grew 44% year over year, steadily improving gross margins and a disciplined cost structure fueled even more acceleration for its bottom line. During the second quarter, earnings per share (EPS) were roughly $2.50 -- representing nearly 61% growth year over year.\n\n... forecasts suggest much more growth is in store\n\nIn 2025 alone, cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, in combination with social media empire Meta Platforms, are expected to collectively have up to $330 billion in capital expenditures (capex). Taking this one step further, management consulting firm McKinsey & Company forecasts that investments in AI infrastructure -- which include data center buildouts and chips -- are expected to reach $6.7 trillion by next decade.\n\nWith TSMC producing more than 40% revenue growth with an estimated 60% of the global chip foundry market, it appears well-positioned to capitalize on these secular tailwinds and acquire even more market share over the next several years.\n\nWhat does TSMC's earnings report tell us about AI demand?\n\nTo me, the simplest explanation of the blowout earnings report is that AI demand is not only strong, but it's also accelerating. While growth will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, I don't really see TSMC as a cyclical semiconductor stock at this point.\n\nRather, the capex and infrastructure trends referenced above underscore how crucial AI growth is to the global economy at this point. The chipmaker's leading foundry services across edge devices, high-performance computing (HPC), and AI accelerators are at the center of this secular evolution.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor stock a buy right now?\n\nDespite the company's jaw-dropping growth and robust outlook, TSMC trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of just 24. Not only is this much lower than historical levels, but it is also a meaningful discount to many other leading chip stocks, too.\n\nWhile skeptics may cite the cyclicality of the chip market or potential geopolitical tensions with China as part of the bear narrative, I think TSMC's current financial profile and its future trajectory speak for themselves regardless of these risks.\n\nIn my eyes, the disconnect between the company's valuation and its underlying business fundamentals could suggest that investors may not fully understand or appreciate the importance of its role in the broader chip ecosystem.\n\nI see TSMC stock as a no-brainer right now, and I think the company's price action suggests it is undervalued. Investors with a long-run time horizon might want to consider scooping up shares and holding on tight as the infrastructure chapter of the AI story continues to be written. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is uniquely positioned to ride these tailwinds and sustain high levels of revenue and profit growth for years to come.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:03:09.381064+00:00"}

Growth stocks are the best choices to add to your portfolio in order to beat the broader indexes like the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average. But I'm not looking to time the market, and I'm not interested in flash-in-the-pan growth stocks that will be falling as quickly as they rise.\n\nInstead, I'm most interested in names that have a long runway for growth. I'm looking for companies with strong business models, a reasonable competitive moat, and most importantly, some momentum to carry it forward for the next decade.\n\nThese three names are top picks that hit all of those requirements: Meta Platforms (META 3.16%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), and Netflix (NFLX 0.55%).\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nThe owner of the Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, and WhatsApp platforms, Meta Platforms, has a dominant share in social media. More than 3.4 billion people use at least one of Meta's platforms each day, the company says, up 6% from a year ago.\n\nAnd Meta is doing an outstanding job of monetizing those users. By using artificial intelligence (AI) and the massive database of personal information supplied by its users, Meta was able to increase ad impressions by 5% in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis, and the average price per ad increased by 10%.\n\nRevenue for the first quarter was $42.3 billion, up 16% from a year ago, and earnings per share of $6.43 were up 37%.\n\nI'm confident that Meta will keep up the momentum. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said Meta plans to buy 1.3 million graphics processing units (GPUs) this year to power its AI ambitions, including its Meta AI generative AI assistant, and is investing as much as $65 billion in capital expenditures.\n\nMeta stock is definitely booming, up 22% so far in 2025.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nMeta isn't the only company buying GPUs as fast as it can -- Mordor Intelligence estimates the GPU market will be $86.7 billion this year and will grow to $352.5 billion by 2030 -- a compound annual growth rate of 33.6%. That's great news for investors of Taiwan Semiconductor, often just known as TSMC, because it is responsible for fabricating most of those products. Statista reports that TSMC currently has a 53% market share of the global foundry market.\n\nTSMC is a popular fabricator because it doesn't make its own chips, so there's no concern that it would use another company's proprietary information. TMSC fabricates 25% of the chips needed by Apple and also counts major companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and Nvidia as customers. TSMC is also spending $165 billion to build manufacturing facilities in Arizona, which should shield it from the long-term impacts of any tariffs or trade tension between Beijing and Washington.\n\nRevenue in the second quarter was $30.07 billion, up 44% from the same quarter a year ago. TSMC stock is up nearly 20% in 2025.\n\n3. Netflix\n\nA few years ago, I was pretty down on Netflix, writing for another publication that the streaming service was in danger of becoming another Blockbuster (a company it helped run nearly out of business), if it failed to adapt to the growing and ever-changing competitive landscape.\n\nWell, I obviously underestimated CEO Reed Hastings and his team, because Netflix did adapt, and it's become the unquestioned king of streaming. That's not going to change any time soon.\n\nFirst, Netflix made a huge change to its business model. After giving a wink and nod to password sharing for years, Netflix finally instituted a new practice in 2023 that began charging an extra $8 to any account holder who shared their account with someone outside their home. That was a game-changer, as Netflix's revenue showed an immediate jump. Quarterly revenue is now up 41% since the change.\n\nIn addition, Netflix began covering more live events and sports, most notably championship boxing matches, the popular weekly Monday Night Raw telecast, and selected NFL football games.\n\nNetflix's second-quarter revenue came in at $11.08 billion, up nearly 16% from a year ago. Notably, Netflix's ad-supported tier (all Netflix live events include advertising) reached 94 million users this year, more than doubling from a year ago.\n\nNetflix stock is up a whopping 36% this year and still has plenty of room to run for a long-term investor.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:03:19.834203+00:00"}

The reality is that massive AI infrastructure is still needed, and the build-out isn't slated to slow anytime soon.\n\nEven though many stocks have already risen significantly, it doesn't mean their upside is capped at today's levels. I wouldn't be surprised to see these four continue to generate substantial returns for investors, potentially enough to be considered a small fortune.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NVDA 0.58%) has been a top AI stock pick for a long time for good reason: Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the AI revolution. They are phenomenal at processing arduous workloads, making them ideal for training and running AI models.\n\nWhile Nvidia has grown significantly over the past few years, it recently received another catalyst: likely being allowed to export GPUs to China. If Nvidia had been allowed to export its H20 chips to China in Q2, its revenue growth rate could have hit 77% instead of the current 50% forecast, so this recent shift could provide a huge boost for the AI giant.\n\nNvidia's growth is far from over, and even though its stock has been on a tear in recent months, it still has a bright long-term outlook.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%) is another stock with an incredibly bright future. It's the world's leading chip foundry, which means it manufactures chips for companies like Nvidia that lack internal capabilities to produce their own -- a capability nearly every tech company lacks.\n\nThis position also provides management with unparalleled insight into the future, as many companies place chip orders years in advance. Starting in 2025, management expects AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next five years, with its overall CAGR nearing 20%.\n\nThat's monster growth for any company, and is a primary reason to buy TSMC's stock today.\n\n3. Digital Realty\n\nThere's more than one way to make a fortune in the stock market. Digital Realty (DLR 0.31%) is a real estate investment trust (REIT), which comes with special requirements, namely that it must pay out 90% of its taxable income in the form of dividends.\n\nDigital Realty specializes in the data center space, and its real estate operations focus on building these facilities worldwide to support the growing demand for AI. This provides both a growth catalyst and a nice 2.7% dividend yield, giving AI investors some balance in their portfolio.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) may not be the first company you think of when you hear AI, but you probably should. Its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the market share leader in its space. It provides companies with the tools to deploy and build generative AI-powered applications, and is experiencing rapid growth, with revenue increasing 17% in its most recent quarter.\n\nHowever, what's even more significant is that AWS accounted for 63% of Amazon's total Q1 profits, indicating that Amazon is more of a cloud computing company than an e-commerce one. With massive tailwinds in the cloud computing space due to increasing AI workloads, this stock is primed to continue rising on the back of cloud computing.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:03:21.509924+00:00"}

And with so many companies using AI technology, there's no shortage of investment opportunities.\n\nWhile businesses involving new technology can be volatile, you don't need to take on outsized risk to get AI exposure. The four companies below are all highly successful and should be long-term winners.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NVDA 0.58%) is the largest AI chipmaker and the largest company in the world, with a market cap of $4.2 trillion as of July 18. While Nvidia is on the expensive side -- it trades at more than 55 times earnings -- it has also delivered double-digit revenue growth for nine consecutive quarters.\n\nConsidering the popularity of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), a crucial part of generative AI infrastructure, that trend should continue. AI hyperscalers are investing heavily in data centers. They spent $430 billion on data centers in 2024, and that's expected to rise to $1.1 trillion by 2029. Nvidia had a 92% share of the data center GPU market in Q1.\n\nIn addition to holding a dominant position in a rapidly growing market, Nvidia is a well-run company with a fantastic company culture, ranking fourth on Glassdoor's list of the best places to work in 2025. Even with a high valuation, this is an excellent business that plays a key role in AI development.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), often shortened to TSMC, is another company that's essential to chipmaking. Other companies design chips, but TSMC handles the manufacturing. Most of the major semiconductor companies are clients of TSMC, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, and Qualcomm.\n\nRising demand for AI chips has driven substantial revenue growth for TSMC. In Q1 2025, TSMC reported $25.5 billion in net revenue, up 35% year over year. It also grew its profit margin, with earnings per share (EPS) increasing 54% to $2.12.\n\nFor a fast-growing tech company, TSMC isn't prohibitively expensive. It trades at less than 28 times earnings at the time of this writing, far cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) had a strong start to the year, as revenue grew 12% year over year to $90.2 billion in Q1 2025. Operating margin increased from 32% to 34%, and EPS increased 49% to $2.81.\n\nYou wouldn't know it from Alphabet's share price, which is down 2% on the year. The prevailing sentiment around this tech giant is concern regarding its online search business. Google Search accounted for 56% of its revenue last quarter ($50.7 billion). The growing popularity of ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots will likely impact that business. If people can get their questions answered by a chatbot, they won't need to search the web as much.\n\nBut Alphabet is leveraging AI to improve its products and services. Google Search results now feature AI Overviews, which have 1.5 billion users per month. Google Gemini, while far behind ChatGPT, is the third-largest AI chatbot with a 13.5% market share. I'd expect that number to grow significantly, given that Gemini is now the default AI assistant on devices running Android 10 or later. Android has a 74% share of the mobile operating system market as of June 2025.\n\nTrading at less than 21 times earnings, Alphabet is cheaper than the S&P 500 index. This is a great opportunity to buy one of the top tech companies without paying a premium.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) is best known for its online retail dominance, and it has incorporated AI to streamline its operations. For a recent example, it's the largest manufacturer of mobile robotics and hit a major milestone last month when it deployed its one-millionth robot. The company also introduced a new generative AI model, DeepFleet, which improves the travel time of its robotic fleet through its fulfillment network by 10%.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said last month that Amazon has more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built. This includes tools for customers, sellers, and advertisers who use Amazon and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nLooking at the most recent numbers, Amazon grew net sales by 9% year over year to $155.7 billion in Q1 2025. Growth in EPS was particularly impressive, jumping 62% to $1.59. Even with shares trading at about 37 times earnings, Amazon is a quality AI stock to have in your portfolio.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:03:23.305887+00:00"}

With the market looking very strong, investors might consider a \"target strike butterfly\" with this chipmaking giant.\n\nThe idea with the trade is that you pick a spot on the chart that you think a stock might get to in the next few weeks. Then set the butterfly trade around that strike. The ideal scenario is that the stock pins that strike right at expiration.\n\nLet's walk through an example. If TSMC breaks out above its all-time high at 248.28, it could head up to 260, so you would center the butterfly around that price.\n\nButterfly spreads involve three different option strikes, all within the same expiration date, and can be created using either calls or puts. By trading a butterfly with a bullish bias, we can place the trade cheaply and also have a large potential payoff.\n\nThree Different Price Options\n\nHere's how you might conduct the trade. First, say you buy one Aug. 15 call at 250, which costs roughly $3.70 a share this morning. Then you sell two Aug. 15 calls at 260 for $1.55 a share. This is our \"target.\" Last, you buy another Aug. 15 call at 270 for 65 cents a share.\n\nThis trade only costs around $125 per spread but has a payoff potential of $875. That maximum profit scenario occurs if TSMC is right at 260 at expiration on Aug. 15. The profit comes from the 250 call while the calls at 260 and 270 expire worthless.\n\nThe maximum loss on the trade is equal to the premium paid of around $125 per contract. This would occur anywhere below 250 or above 270.\n\nTo calculate the $875 maximum profit, take the width of the butterfly, which is 10 times $100, less the $125 premium paid.\n\nTaking a low-risk trade like this can be one way to participate in any further rally without risking too much capital.\n\nTSMC Stock: No Earnings Risk\n\nTSMC has already reported second-quarter results, so there would be no earnings risk with this trade.\n\nAccording to IBD Stock Checkup from Investor's Business Daily, TSMC stock ranks first in its group. It has a best-possible Composite Rating of 99, an EPS Rating of 98 and a Relative Strength Rating of 89.\n\nPlease remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\n\nThis article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

Revenue rose to US$30.1 billion, up 17.8% sequentially in USD terms, driven by advanced nodes like 3nm and 5nm, while EPS surged 60.7% YOY to NT$15.36.\n\nGross margin held at 58.6% despite forex headwinds, as mid-90s capacity utilization and cost efficiencies offset overseas fab dilution. Management raised full-year revenue growth guidance to around 30% in USD on sustained AI and high-performance computing (HPC) demand, though it flagged Q4 caution on tariffs and macro risks.\n\nAdvanced technologies accounted for 74% of wafer revenue, with 3nm and 5nm driving the mix, while HPC dominated with 60% of revenue, supported by sovereign AI projects and edge AI development. The company’s strategic expansion continues with US$165 billion in U.S. fabs, N2 node production in H2 2025, and accelerated advanced packaging to meet AI demand. Shares rose 4% post-earnings, pushing TSM’s market cap toward US$1 trillion, as analysts cited the results as a bellwether for AI momentum.\n\nChallenges include forex volatility, overseas fab dilution, geopolitical tensions, and packaging bottlenecks, but TSM’s scale and technology leadership underpin resilience. With 30% growth and AI tailwinds, TSM’s forward P/E of 24–25 reflects a reasonable premium, and institutional sentiment remains positive with 10–15% upside. For investors, the quarter underscores TSM’s pivotal role in AI supply chains and global chip dynamics, with upcoming N2 ramps, Q4 execution, and tariff impacts as key watchpoints amid a structurally supportive demand environment.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) by Oguz Erkan in May 2025, which highlighted TSM’s dominance in advanced chip manufacturing and strong AI-driven growth prospects.

If production is interrupted during critical stages, like photolithography or plasma etching, thousands of wafers may be damaged. This can result in significant losses from wasted materials, extended downtime, delayed shipments and diminished customer confidence.\n\nOn Aug. 3, 2018, a WannaCry variant affected Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., disrupting both computer systems and manufacturing tools at multiple facilities in Taiwan.

Wei said at the time he didn’t expect any hacking and “this was purely our negligence.” At the time, a company spokesperson told Bank Info Security “this tool arrived at our facility with a virus already on it.”\n\nThe key lesson from this incident extended well beyond strengthening cybersecurity through technologies and processes. It underscored how critical security guidelines and successful implementation are across the chipmaking ecosystem.\n\nIn the years that followed, semiconductor fabs systematically enhanced their cybersecurity posture through a three-stage, inside-out approach: securing operational environments, inspecting inbound devices and reinforcing supply chain cybersecurity. Further incidents have happened in the years since and the industry has made a coordinated effort, led by a consortium, to bolster its work through initiatives such as a new security standard.\n\nA growing issue\n\nTerence Liu, CEO of Taiwan-based cybersecurity firm TXOne Networks, has had a tough job over the past decade. As a key provider for TSMC, TXOne purpose-built its software and hardware to protect critical infrastructure in more than a dozen countries.\n\nInitial efforts focused on safeguarding internal operations. This included protecting critical production systems through network segmentation, endpoint protection and virtual patching to reduce exposure to known vulnerabilities.\n\nLiu said that as these internal measures matured, “the focus expanded to securing what enters the fab environment,” adding that “strict inspection and validation processes were established for incoming equipment and devices, particularly those introduced by employees, contractors, or integration partners.” This step helped reduce the risk of inadvertently introducing threats into highly sensitive production areas.\n\nSources say companies came to recognize that effective cybersecurity must extend to the broader supply chain. Suppliers are now expected to demonstrate stronger security practices. This often involves completing structured questionnaires and undergoing external vulnerability scans to validate the maturity of their internal cybersecurity controls.\n\nAt the same time, there is growing awareness that securing the semiconductor industry requires collective action across the entire value chain, including manufacturers, equipment vendors and software providers.\n\nSeveral major semiconductor firms have taken the lead in forming communities under the influential organization SEMI, formerly known as the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International. A notable example of this collaboration is the Taiwan Semiconductor Cybersecurity Committee, chaired by TSMC.\n\nOne notable outcome is the development of the SEMI E187 fab equipment cybersecurity specification. This landmark standard is tailored to the unique characteristics of semiconductor manufacturing environments, where equipment lifecycles often span decades and operational continuity is critical.\n\nThe standard has evolved into a key purchasing requirement for many leading manufacturers and is now enforced throughout their supply chains. The supply chain enforcement is real and growing, with E187 certification now a baseline expectation for OEMs supplying to global fabs.\n\nTSMC’s contract now mandates it, and official reference guides firmly embed it into procurement criteria. Certification bodies, such as Bureau Veritas and Intertek, offer formal assessment services and structured paths toward compliance. Companies such as Gallant, Control, and Delta have already qualified, signaling the existence of structured, scalable compliance paths, not just voluntary guidance.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWhat began as a regional initiative has quickly grown into a global movement.\n\nJames Tu, TSMC’s head of corporate information security, outlined a vision to extend this cybersecurity uplift across the entire global semiconductor ecosystem during a talk at Semicon West in 2023. Tu plays a key role at Semi’s Taiwan Cybersecurity Committee.\n\n“Let us work together to enhance global supply chain security by influencing our own suppliers and partnering with SEMI,” he said. Tu stressed the need to influence TSMC’s suppliers, collaborate with SEMI, and support the committee’s members to create a ripple effect that boosts supply chain security broadly.\n\nThis vision ultimately led to the formation of the Semiconductor Manufacturing Cybersecurity Consortium, a global group dedicated to advancing cyber resilience across the semiconductor supply chain.\n\nSMCC aims to unite chipmakers, equipment firms, cybersecurity vendors and nonprofits to safeguard semiconductor production from rising cyber threats. Its working groups focus on building implementation frameworks, aligning with global regulations and strengthening supply chain resilience. SMCC also monitors regulations such as the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act.\n\nIn the past, each semiconductor fab required suppliers to complete its own cybersecurity questionnaire, which placed a heavy burden on suppliers who had to respond to numerous, varying assessments. SMCC consolidated expert input and developed a unified cybersecurity assessment questionnaire, serving as a standardized baseline for self-assessment and continuous improvement. This reduced the time and effort required from suppliers. SMCC also published the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Semiconductor Profile.\n\nDuring a February 2023 NIST workshop, then-Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly applauded NIST’s work to update the framework. She and CISA had been pushing for the technology community to focus on “product safety” and “the idea that software and hardware must be secure by design and secure by default”. She said the framework had been useful to companies seeking out a clear and actionable foundation for implementation — especially one that aligns with globally recognized best practices.\n\nThis comes as the sector still faces a wave of cyber threats, with attackers targeting critical infrastructure, intellectual property, and production systems. Advanced persistent threats, ransomware and firmware-level attacks are becoming more sophisticated, often backed by nation-state actors.\n\nExperts say that what distinguishes the semiconductor industry in its cybersecurity transformation is the ability to combine deep technical expertise with a collaborative, long-term plan that involves shared responsibility.\n\nWhile not every industry operates with the semiconductor industry’s high level of complexity or automation, the principles are broadly applicable: Cybersecurity is no longer optional. It’s a foundational element of operational resilience and business trust.\n\nAs TXOne Networks’ Liu likes to emphasize, “strong [operational technology] security not only protects production but also safeguards long-term competitiveness.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:03:45.991028+00:00"}

Not every stock is a smart buy right now, but there is one that stands out above the rest as potentially the smartest stock pick.\n\nMy smartest growth stock to buy now is Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%). It occupies a crucial position within the chip fabrication industry and has massive tailwinds blowing in its favor. It also doesn't appear to be overly expensive, considering the growth it's expected to achieve over the next few years, making it an excellent stock to consider now.\n\nTSMC's new chip node has high expectations\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is in an enviable position within the chip world. It has a dominant grip on the chip fabrication market, mainly due to its cutting-edge technology, superior yields, and neutral position.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor boasts several of the world's top tech companies as clients, including Nvidia and Apple. These companies selected TSMC for the reasons listed above, but one of the biggest factors is that TSMC isn't trying to compete with any of its clients on the open market. It's only offering its foundry service to its customers, which assures its clients that it won't attempt to steal any proprietary technology for their own benefit.\n\nTaiwan Semi is also at the forefront of new chip technology, ensuring customers won't have to hop from foundry to foundry to access the latest technology. Later this year, TSMC is launching its 2nm (nanometer) chip node, and its 1.6nm node is scheduled for production next year. Management is excited about its 2nm node, as demand for this technology is exceeding that of 3nm and 5nm launches. This could indicate upcoming growth for TSMC, as the improvements that 2nm provides are drastic enough that the companies are willing to adopt this cutting-edge technology.\n\nThe biggest improvement 2nm chips provide over previous generations is their power consumption. When configured for the same speed as 3nm chips, they consume 25% to 30% less power. Considering power consumption is a significant sticking point for AI, this improvement could lead to numerous upgrades, as the enhanced technology may pay for itself over its operational life.\n\nThere are several reasons TSMC's stock looks promising, but how does its projected growth and valuation compare?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor doesn't trade at a premium\n\nAt the start of 2025, management projected that its AI-related revenue would increase at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with total revenue increasing at nearly a 20% CAGR. That's incredible growth, and everything TSMC has done so far in 2025 backs up that claim, if not advances it a bit further.\n\nTSMC's Q2 revenue increased 44% in U.S. dollars, which beat expectations. It also indicated 38% revenue growth for Q3, which is still an impressive figure considering its size.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is experiencing incredible growth and is expected to continue doing so for some time. However, the stock doesn't trade at much of a premium to the broader market. With the S&P 500 trading for 23.8 times forward earnings, TSMC's 24.6 times forward earnings doesn't look all that pricey.\n\nEssentially, you're buying a company that trades for the same price as the S&P 500, yet it is expected to grow at twice its historical average through 2030.\n\nThat makes TSMC a no-brainer buy here, and I believe it's one of the smartest growth stocks for investors to buy now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:03:47.558546+00:00"}
