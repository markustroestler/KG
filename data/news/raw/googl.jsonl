Here is what might happen if things don't work out as investors hope.\n\nTesla (TSLA 0.54%) is one of the world's largest companies by market value, worth a little over $1 trillion today. The company is a pioneer in electric vehicles, autonomous driving software, and renewable energy, and is charging full steam into Robotaxis and humanoid robotics.\n\nAt face value, there is a lot to like about this technology company. But when you dig deeper, Tesla is far riskier as an investment, given its past success and massive valuation.\n\nSure, Tesla has a high ceiling, but it also has a very low floor. That's why I predict that Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) and Toyota Motor (TM 2.56%) will both be worth more than Tesla three years from now.\n\nIt's not as far-fetched as it sounds. Here is what you need to know.\n\nTesla's ambitious plans will likely take time, and that could spell near-term trouble\n\nThe narrative around Tesla is shifting from its legacy electric vehicle business to Robotaxi and humanoid robotics, which CEO Elon Musk and an increasing number of investors expect to carry the company's value moving forward.\n\nTesla's electric vehicle sales have started to decline, which could be at least partially due to Elon Musk's sometimes controversial, politicized persona. The issue here is that Tesla has only just begun launching its Robotaxi business, which is limited to a small number of vehicles with multiple safety measures in place. Tesla wants to expand its fleet rapidly, but that may take longer than most want to believe due to local and state-level regulations. Remember, Tesla's self-driving technology has still only obtained Level 2 capability, which mandates a human driver be present in the vehicle while it is autonomously operating.\n\nOptimus, Tesla's humanoid robot, is also still in early stages. While the company aims to build 5,000 Optimus units this year, reports indicate that Tesla is behind on that. Perhaps Optimus will someday generate the trillions of dollars in revenue Elon Musk believes it can, but Tesla has infamously established numerous timetables before that have failed to execute as promised.\n\nUnless Tesla can ramp Robotaxi and Optimus very quickly over the next year or so, the company's recent sales struggles could weigh significantly on the stock:\n\nOver the past few years, revenue growth ceased and then turned negative. Profit margins have cratered. If investors make Tesla a \"prove it\" story, the stock, trading at over 12 times revenue, could reasonably see at least 50% downside as its valuation shifts to more closely resemble that of an automotive manufacturer than a technology company.\n\nInvestors may not appreciate Toyota enough\n\nTake Toyota, for example, which is the world's most valuable legacy automotive company. Its revenue continues to grow to new highs, and its profit margin is far higher, clearing Tesla by over 3 percentage points. Ironically, Toyota has a market cap of just $246 billion, valuing the stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of less than 1.0, and a fraction of Tesla's.\n\nTo be fair to Tesla, I don't think it's likely that the stock's valuation drops all the way down to Toyota's level. The upside is too high if it delivers on Robotaxi and Optimus as investors hope -- even if it takes longer than expected.\n\nBut Toyota could surpass Tesla's value if the two meet somewhere in the middle. Using each's trailing-12-month revenue, Toyota's valuation would overtake Tesla's at a P/S ratio of 1, if Tesla's fell to about 3. This comparison is more about Tesla's downside than Toyota's upside, but it highlights Tesla's potential risks if the company doesn't follow through on some very ambitious goals.\n\nAlphabet is the true market leader in self-driving vehicles\n\nIt seems safe to say that Waymo is currently the leading autonomous ride-hailing company. That puts parent company Alphabet in the driver's seat.\n\nAlphabet, valued at over $2.3 trillion, is already worth more than Tesla, but some may not feel it will remain that way. Ark Invest's Cathie Wood believes that Tesla's value will skyrocket on Robotaxi growth. But I'm skeptical, at least of such a short time frame, for the reasons I walked through above. Additionally, Alphabet is a central player in artificial intelligence, with a blossoming cloud-computing business and digital advertising business that generates cash flow.\n\nSome might not associate Alphabet with self-driving vehicles. Yet Alphabet is arguably the perfect company to go after that market because it has such strong existing businesses that can fund the investments to develop a self-driving fleet and expand it across the United States. Waymo continues to announce new markets, and until Tesla and Robotaxi close the gap, it's hard not to like Alphabet's prospects better than Tesla's moving forward.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:58:21.085195+00:00"}

These 3 Semiconductor Stocks Could Be the Biggest Winners (Hint: Not Nvidia)", "summary": "There's still a lot of opportunity left in AI, and these three stocks look underpriced right now.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/13/tech-spend-1-trillion-semiconductor-stock-win/", "published_at": "2025-08-13T08:35:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "There's still a lot of opportunity left in AI, and these three stocks look underpriced right now.\n\nEvery month it seems like one company or another announces it is increasing its budget for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. Last month, Alphabet released plans for $85 billion in capital expenditures (capex) this year, up from its original 2025 outlook of $75 billion. Not to be outdone, Amazon, a week later, said it increased its capex budget to $118 billion, up from $100 billion.\n\nBig tech's spending is only set to climb higher over the next few years. Market researcher Dell'Oro Group forecasts the top 10 big tech companies will spend over $1 trillion on AI infrastructure in 2028. That's up from about $593 billion this year.\n\nNvidia has been one of the biggest winners of these companies' spending spree so far. Its GPUs play a crucial role in AI training and inference servers. Demand for its chips has pushed both its volume and pricing higher, and that's reflected in its incredible revenue and profit growth over the last three years. Roughly two and a half years into the generative AI revolution, the company saw its revenue climb another 69% year over year, with profits climbing 57% on an adjusted basis during its most recent quarter.\n\nBut Nvidia's strong results of the last three years don't necessarily make the stock a shoo-in to be a great investment over the next three years. In fact, the following three semiconductor stocks look like better investments right now to capitalize on the continued increase in AI spending by big tech.\n\n1. Marvell Technology\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL 0.69%) is the chipmaker behind custom AI chip designs from Amazon and Microsoft. Instead of GPUs, these custom chips, called XPUs, are designed to more exact specifications to optimize price performance for large language model training or inference.\n\nThe XPU opportunity is growing quickly, as big tech companies look to use more cost-efficient chips and reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Broadcom, another XPU maker, expects its three custom silicon customers to spend $60 billion to $90 billion on chips by 2027. Marvell sees a $55 billion opportunity for its customers by 2028. To put that in perspective, its revenue over the last four quarters totals $6.5 billion.\n\nAnd Marvell looks poised to capitalize on that opportunity. Microsoft recently upgraded the specifications of its next-generation Maia300 chip, according to a report from Fubon Research. And while that will push out the production timeline until late next year, it also suggests Microsoft will ramp up its production quickly.\n\nFubon expects 300,000 to 400,000 units ordered for the fourth quarter of 2026, with a similar pace of spending throughout 2027. That could mean $10 billion to $12 billion in annual revenue from a single chip design.\n\nMarvell also designs networking chips for getting the most out of GPUs and XPUs. Networking equipment ensures data moves quickly and efficiently from one server to another. That's essential for getting the most out of the processing capabilities of the expensive servers used for training and running AI systems.\n\nAs mentioned, it isn't the only company working with big tech on custom silicon solutions. Broadcom has several high-profile contracts as well, and just as many opportunities to expand its market share as Marvell.\n\nBut Broadcom's stock is far more expensive for new investors at the moment. Marvell trades for 27 times forward earnings estimates compared to a multiple of 45 for Broadcom. That makes Marvell a much better option for investors looking to capitalize on the rise of custom silicon.\n\n2. Micron Technology\n\nMicron Technology (MU 3.26%) is one of a handful of suppliers of memory chips. Perhaps the most important type of memory chip for generative AI is called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM. These chips are attached to GPUs, giving the processors access to data with minimal latency.\n\nMicron was a bit late to develop its HBM chips, but it has quickly caught up to the competition, and it's winning some big contracts. AMD tapped Micron to supply the HBM3E chips in its MI355X GPUs, which have shown promising results. AMD's newest chips could be poised to take share of the GPU market from Nvidia by offering competitive price performance.\n\nMicron plans to start production on its HBM4 chips next year, after delivering samples to potential customers in the first half of this year. Management says the new chips offer a 60% performance improvement over its current generation of chips with a 20% reduction in power consumption.\n\nHBM chips have been the biggest driver of Micron's results recently. Sales of HBM increased 50% sequentially, driving overall revenue up by 15% from its previous quarter and 51% from the previous year.\n\nAnd the continued ramp-up in HBM should drive expanding margins. Management's outlook calls for a 42% gross margin next quarter, up from 39% in its most recent quarter and 28% a year ago.\n\nThe company sees very strong profit growth in the near future as GPU and XPU makers continue to buy up its memory chips, but it faces significant risks. Since Micron manufactures its own chips, it spends heavily on tooling and capacity while demand increases. But if demand falls, it could see a sharp drop in profitability. That's exacerbated by the fact that memory chips aren't well differentiated and a customer could easily switch suppliers.\n\nStill, the stock currently trades for just 14 times earnings estimates. At that price, investors are getting a lot of potential. And if AI spending continues to rise as expected, this earnings cycle could extend well into the future, making the current price for Micron Technology a great opportunity for investors.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), known as TSMC for short, is the largest chip fabricator in the world. If Nvidia, Broadcom, Marvell, or anyone else wants a leading-edge chip design produced, they're probably going to work with TSMC. That's because it has some of the best technology in the world. As a result, roughly two-thirds of all silicon manufacturing spending goes to the Taiwanese company.\n\nTSMC's technology lead is supported by a virtuous cycle. Since the company commands a huge share of all spending, it has more money to reinvest in research and development (R&D) and building extra capacity. With more R&D spending, it's able to develop and perfect the next-generation processes faster, and it has the capacity to meet demand for new chips, bringing in even more revenue.\n\nThe company recently received several pieces of good news, further improving its competitive position in the industry. First, Intel said it wouldn't offer fabrication services for its newest-generation process. And if it didn't get a major customer under contract for its next-generation process, it would stop developing it entirely. That leaves one less competitor for TSMC as it ramps up its next-generation 2nm process.\n\nAnd TSMC received an exemption from the Trump administration's 100% tariff on foreign-sourced semiconductors. That exemption was likely due to huge commitments from the company to build factories in Arizona.\n\nBoth clear the way for TSMC to ramp up production of its 2nm process, which already has customers lined up. The company is reportedly charging a significant premium over the previous generation 3nm chips. Combined with a quick ramp up in production, it should support strong gross margins as it quickly transitions to the next-generation node.\n\nDespite the recent price gains in the stock on the good news, TSMC shares currently trade for less than 25 times forward earnings. Considering management expects average revenue increases of 20% per year between now and 2029 based on strong AI chip growth, that's still a great price to pay for a company with huge competitive advantages.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:58:22.517530+00:00"}

It's not about hype anymore, as AI is starting to reshape the world we live in.\n\nLet's look at three no-brainer AI stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Palantir\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR 2.30%) made its mark in the government sector after 9/11, providing advanced data analytics to agencies that required rapid solutions. That core business remains strong, but the company's biggest opportunity is now in the commercial sector. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) takes data from countless sources, organizes it into an \"ontology,\" and makes it usable for AI models. The result is that its platform can provide actionable insights that can solve real-world problems across industries.\n\nThe company is seeing AIP being adopted in the commercial space at a blistering pace. Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue jumped 93% last quarter, while its remaining deal value more than doubled to $2.79 billion. Its customer count climbed 64% year over year, yet most are still early in their AIP journey. AIP is essentially becoming an operating system for AI, and its breadth of use cases just gives Palantir an enormous runway for growth ahead.\n\nThe company is also firing on all cylinders on the government side as well, as the U.S. government begins to embrace AI. Its U.S. government revenue surged 53% to $426 million in Q2, with the company winning business across civil, intel, and defense contracts. A recent 10-year, $10 billion U.S. Army contract shows how much of a leader Palantir has become in the defense industry.\n\nWhile Palantir's valuation is high, the company's growth only continues to accelerate. As a true leader in AI, it has the opportunity to grow into one of the largest companies in the world.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) is building one of the most powerful AI operations in the world. In logistics, it's using AI to decide where products should be stored, map faster delivery routes, and even guide drivers to hard-to-find drop-off spots in places like large apartment complexes. It also has more than a million AI robots deployed in its warehouses, including advanced models that can detect damaged goods, handle odd-shaped packages, and repair themselves. It's also introduced a new AI model called DeepFleet that coordinates these robots to move products more efficiently through its warehouses.\n\nThis is helping lead to strong operating leverage in its e-commerce business. This was on display in Q2, as its North America operating income surged 47% last quarter on just 11% revenue growth. Its high-margin advertising business is another bright spot, growing 23% year over year. Here, the company is using AI to improve targeting, bidding, and creative ad generation.\n\nIn cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market leader and is becoming a critical AI platform. Bedrock and SageMaker make it easier for customers to build and run AI models on its infrastructure, while its custom-built chips give AWS a cost edge as AI workloads grow. It's also introduced new tools like Strands and AgentCore to help customers safely build and run AI agents. The company is investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet surging demand, a strategy that should drive strong returns for years.\n\nBetween a leaner, more profitable e-commerce business and a market-leading cloud unit, Amazon has two growth engines. The company's willingness to invest heavily for the future remains one of its strongest advantages, and the biggest reason to own the stock for the long haul.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nOne AI stock that often gets overlooked is Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%). The idea that AI would hurt Google Search hasn't panned out. AI Overviews are driving more user engagement, with more than 2 billion people now using them monthly, and search queries are climbing worldwide. Search revenue grew 12% last quarter, an acceleration that shows the strategy is working. Meanwhile, AI Mode and the Gemini app are only just beginning to scale up.\n\nGoogle Cloud is firing on all cylinders as well, with revenue up 32% in Q2 and operating profit more than doubling. AI demand is a big driver, as customers use Google's Vertex platform to build and deploy AI models on its infrastructure. Meanwhile, its custom AI chips, Tensor Processing Units, can help run workloads more efficiently and are seeing increased adoption. Even with Alphabet planning to spend $85 billion in data center-related capital expenditures this year, its cloud computing capacity is expected to stay tight into 2026, a sign that demand remains high.\n\nIn addition, YouTube is holding up nicely, with ad revenue rising 13% and Shorts bringing in new ad opportunities. Waymo, meanwhile, is rolling out into more cities, while the company is also investing in quantum computing.\n\nFor a company growing double-digits across multiple divisions, Alphabet's valuation is surprisingly low. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 20 times 2025 analyst estimates, and a forward price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 0.85. (Stocks with PEG ratios below 1 are usually regarded as undervalued.) It's a stock that offers both growth and value, and it has the greatest potential to be one of the biggest long-term AI winners in the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:58:23.923812+00:00"}

But Nvidia's visionary CEO, Jensen Huang, saw the broad potential of these advanced chips before anyone else.\n\nWhen the GPU was initially released, AI applications were both niche and barely imagined. But Huang understood that the world's most important problems would be solved by anticipating latent needs -- capabilities that people will demand at some point in the future, even if they can't fully describe them today.\n\nHuang realized that GPUs could be parlayed for more sophisticated problem solving that traditional CPUs at the time could not handle efficiently, ultimately becoming the foundational layer on which artificial intelligence (AI) modeling, research, and data analytics are built.\n\nIn a similar fashion, internet and cloud computing juggernaut Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) has been quietly pushing the envelope in a new pocket of the AI realm that's gaining attention: quantum computing.\n\nLet's dive into Alphabet's innovative approach to developing quantum applications and explore how the company's progress parallels that of Nvidia's pioneering role in AI before it went mainstream.\n\nHow is Alphabet building quantum computing applications?\n\nBack in December, Alphabet unveiled its latest breakthrough in the quantum computing arms race: a processor called Willow. With 105 qubits and enhanced algorithmic features across error correction, Willow might appear as just another incremental improvement over prior generations of quantum chips released by Alphabet and its peers.\n\nWhere Willow caught the attention of AI enthusiasts was through an experiment in Random Circuit Sampling (RCS), in which its quantum processing was measured against classical supercomputers. In this study, Alphabet claims that Willow solved a sophisticated series of computations in under 5 minutes that would take today's most capable supercomputers an estimated 10 septillion years to complete.\n\nWhy Alphabet is to quantum computing what Nvidia is to AI\n\nWhile Alphabet's quantum supremacy may not have ample commercial uses today, the idea here is that the company's innovations and technological breakthroughs are similar to that of Nvidia and the invention of the GPU back in the late 1990s. Willow and the GPU both represent underlying proof that Alphabet and Nvidia have been at the forefront of innovations where conventional approaches are not able to compete at scale.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, Alphabet is not building its AI business through a singular lens. Under its umbrella, Alphabet has TensorFlow -- an open-source machine learning platform. In addition, Alphabet's Google Quantum AI team operates an open-source software framework called Cirq, which helps Python developers research and build applications. Lastly, Google DeepMind serves as a research lab spanning various aspects of the AI spectrum, including quantum computing.\n\nTo me, the formation of Alphabet's AI ecosystem aligns closely with Nvidia's approach. Outside of its hardware specialty, Nvidia also offers software through its CUDA infrastructure. This decision ultimately created a virtuous cycle in which developers building generative AI applications continually demand additional GPU and software capacity -- leading to a self-reinforcing technological moat for Nvidia.\n\nI think Alphabet is employing a similar strategy, betting that classical computing will eventually become exhausted by increasingly sophisticated AI workloads. When this occurs, Alphabet will have already architected the leap from classical to quantum computing.\n\nJust as Nvidia has done throughout the AI revolution thanks to its GPUs and software platform, Alphabet could one day be positioned as the main ecosystem on which quantum applications are developed.\n\nIs Alphabet stock a buy right now?\n\nThroughout the AI revolution, many of Alphabet's peers have experienced notable expansion in their valuation multiples.\n\nAt the moment, however, Alphabet is trading roughly in line with its three-year average forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio. Not only is the valuation discount to its peers striking, but I think it's overstated.\n\nOver the last three years, Alphabet has continued to innovate across several areas of AI, including new capabilities in search, video, e-commerce, cybersecurity, and of course, hardware such as quantum chips. Nevertheless, the upside from these investments do not appear to be fully priced into the company's long-term financial success.\n\nJust as Nvidia has proven to be one of the most lucrative long-term buys of the decade, I see Alphabet positioned to follow a prolonged breakout period featuring notable valuation expansion as its AI-powered products continue to scale and become a more central part of the company's growth narrative. For these reasons, I think that Alphabet stock is dirt cheap and looks like a compelling opportunity at its current price level.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:58:32.518096+00:00"}

On Aug. 12, reports surfaced that Perplexity is going after one of Alphabet's (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) crown jewels: the Chrome search browser.\n\nThis is more than a symbolic transaction: it's a $34.5 billion offer to completely transform how information is accessed.\n\nLet's discuss why this acquisition offer is so important, and what it could mean for the dynamics of internet search -- which hasn't witnessed serious, existential disruption since Alphabet released Google nearly three decades ago.\n\nWhat is Perplexity?\n\nLaunched in 2022, Perplexity is a large language model (LLM) that competes heavily with industry leaders such as ChatGPT, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, and xAI's Grok. Backed by more than $1 billion in capital from a mix of venture capital (VC) firms such as Bessemer Venture Partners and New Enterprise Associates, as well as strategic backers like Nvidia, SoftBank, and Databricks, Perplexity boasts a reported valuation of $18 billion -- making its offer for Chrome even more outrageous.\n\nAccording to data compiled by FirstPageSage, ChatGPT is the most widely used chatbot -- boasting an estimated 60% market share -- while Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini each hold about 14% market share. Perplexity ranks fourth with about half the market presence of Copilot and Gemini.\n\nOne of Perplexity's differentiators over other LLMs is that answers to queries can actually appear as indexed webpages on Google Search -- a feature that blends both conversational AI and traditional search protocols. This capability could be one of the core inspirations surrounding Perplexity's interest in owning Chrome.\n\nIronically, I recently wrote an article in which I posited the idea of Apple acquiring Perplexity and integrating the LLM into its Safari search browser. Chrome is far more valuable than Safari, though. Strategically speaking, I understand the theoretical logic and rationale behind why Perplexity wants Google's coveted search asset, as Chrome serves as a distribution channel for billions of users on a global scale.\n\nWhy Perplexity's offer is important\n\nWhile Alphabet's second-quarter earnings results suggest the company still has enormous leverage when it comes to surface area on the internet, the rise of LLMs has led some industry experts to posit the idea that Google is losing its dominance in search. I suspect that any hint of waning search parameters or a crack in Google's moat gave Perplexity an excuse to try to capitalize on perceived weakness.\n\nIn a scenario where Alphabet actually divested Chrome -- as unlikely as this is -- it would represent the first seismic shift in search since Google took the throne away from early disrupters such as Yahoo and Ask Jeeves (now Ask.com).\n\nMy prediction for what will happen\n\nWhile I think Perplexity's offer is more symbolic than anything, it does open the door to some interesting discussions. What I mean by that is AI developers no longer seem to be satisfied touting higher user engagement stats and nominal upgrades in performance.\n\nRather, Perplexity and its peers are now seeking to integrate (or overtake) big tech's legacy product features and own the distribution channels on which consumers engage and access information. If Perplexity were to be the sole operator of Chrome, it could essentially redirect traffic on the internet into its native AI-driven ecosystem.\n\nI think Perplexity's bid for Chrome will ultimately motivate Alphabet to think defensively and deliver on some welcomed and potentially much-needed innovation to the search market -- which it essentially has a monopoly on.\n\nI would not be surprised if Alphabet swiftly integrates more of Gemini's generative AI capabilities across its entire ecosystem -- from Google Search, Maps, Workspace, Android, and YouTube. Taking this a step further, Alphabet could push harder in driving more enterprise subscriptions for Gemini, much in the same way Microsoft has done with Copilot. The end goal for Alphabet should be to make its AI so embedded that it eliminates the very idea of entertaining other platforms.\n\nAt the end of the day, Perplexity's offer for Chrome is intentionally bold, and I don't think Alphabet is going to even blink. With that said, should AI-powered browsers emerge as the next frontier for LLMs, there is no company better-positioned than Alphabet. The bigger question is how the company will take advantage of its lucrative positioning, and whether or not it will do so proactively or wait for further competition to force its hand.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:58:33.922989+00:00"}

So what are the best stocks to buy now or put on a watchlist? Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Lam Research (LRCX), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Rollins (ROL) are prime candidates.\n\nThe market confounded expectations for difficulties and turned in an outstanding performance in 2023 and 2024. Donald Trump's election victory initially boosted stocks, but they then got walloped due to the Trump administration's tariff agenda. The market is back near highs, however, as Trump has eased tariffs, at least temporarily. The Federal Reserve outlook is unclear amid elevated inflation and Trump policy uncertainty.\n\nBest Stocks To Buy: The Crucial Ingredients\n\nRemember, there are thousands of stocks trading on the NYSE and Nasdaq. But you want to find the very best stocks right now to generate massive gains.\n\nThe IBD Methodology offers clear guidelines on what you should be looking for. Invest in stocks with recent quarterly and annual earnings growth of at least 25%. Look for companies that have new, game-changing products and services. Also consider not-yet-profitable companies, often recent IPOs, that are generating tremendous revenue growth.\n\nUsing such an approach can help give you an edge over the benchmark S&P 500. Outdoing this industry benchmark is key to generating exceptional returns over the long term.\n\nIn addition, keep an eye on supply and demand for the stock itself, focus on leading stocks in top industry groups, and aim for stocks with strong institutional support.\n\nOnce you have found a stock that fits the criteria, it is then time to turn to stock charts to plot a good entry point. You should wait for a stock to form a base and then buy it once it reaches a buy point, ideally in heavy volume. In many cases, a stock reaches a proper buy point when it breaks above the original high on the left side of the base. More information on what a base is, and how charts can be used to win big on the stock market, can be found here.\n\nDon't Forget The Stock Market Direction When Buying Stocks\n\nA key part of investing is to keep track of the market. Most stocks, even the very best, follow the market direction. Invest when the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend and move to cash when the stock market goes into a correction.\n\nThe stock market turned in stunning gains in 2023 and 2024. The major indexes surged to record highs in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential victory, but tariff worries and a more cautious outlook from the Fed on interest rates are now weighing on stocks.\n\nThe stock market is back near highs after fighting back with aplomb after coming under considerable pressure. However indexes reversed Friday. The S&P 500 has moved above its 50-day moving average as well as its 200-day line, as has the Nasdaq composite. They were briefly forced below the short-term 21-day line, but have rallied back. Recent gains were impressive as stocks come off lows.\n\nThe current fight-back means investors should be putting money to work, though they should still be on their guard in case of another pullback in this headline-driven market. The selections below are among the best stocks to buy or watch now. The IBD 50 is also a rich hunting ground.\n\nIn addition, it is now especially crucial to stay on top of sell signals. Any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price should be jettisoned. Also beware of sharp breaks below the 50-day or 10-week moving average.\n\nThings can change quickly when it comes to the stock market. Make sure to keep a close eye on the market trend page here.\n\nBest Stocks To Buy Or Watch\n\nAlphabet\n\nLam Research\n\nLas Vegas Sands\n\nUrban Outfitters\n\nRollins\n\nNow let's look at these five stocks to buy or watch. An important consideration is that these best stocks to buy and watch all boast impressive relative strength.\n\nAlphabet Stock\n\nAI stock Google is in the buy zone above a cup-with-handle entry of 197.95, according to MarketSurge analysis. It comes after it cleared an earlier handle entry within the base.\n\nThe stock has rebounded well after getting support at the 50-day moving average. It managed to hold above its 21-day exponential moving average despite a broad pullback.\n\nThe relative strength line is moving higher as well, an encouraging sign. This gauges a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500.\n\nThe internet play is an excellent all-around performer, which is reflected in its very strong IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of 99.\n\nPrice performance is a weak spot, with Alphabet only among the top 14% of issues in terms of gains over the past 12 months. However it is improving, and GOOGL stock is now up nearly 8% this year.\n\nIn addition, fundamental performance is top notch, with its EPS Rating coming in at a near-perfect 97. Profits have grown by an average of 27% over the past three quarters.\n\nWall Street expects more progress ahead, with profits seen rising 28% in 2025. This means it is expected to exceed the 25% growth sought by those following IBD investing principles.\n\nBig Money has been adding to holdings of the stock of late, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating coming in at B.\n\nFunds currently hold 41% of shares overall, MarketSurge data shows. This is a solid level of institutional ownership.\n\nEarnings are out of the way for the Magnificent Seven name, a plus. Q2 earnings and revenue topped estimates while internet search advertising and cloud computing revenue came in above expectations.\n\nThe Google parent is investing heavily in artificial intelligence. The firm said it expects capital spending to reach $85 billion in 2025, up from earlier guidance of $75 billion. With the updated guidance, capital spending is expected to jump 62% in 2025, up from a 43% increase.\n\n\"The step-up in capital spending is reflective of the company leaning in behind strong demand it's seeing across cloud products and services,\" said Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali in a research report.\n\nAt Evercore ISI, analyst Mark Mahaney said investors should monitor operating margins. Like Microsoft (MSFT), which recently announced job cuts, Google is using AI internally for software coding projects.\n\n\"As the company ramps capital spending, will AI-driven efficiencies support more disciplined headcount growth?\" Mahaney said in a note to clients.\n\nLam Research Stock\n\nChip equipment play Lam Research is in the buy zone above a handle entry of 102.59. This can be interpreted as a large cup-with-handle base.\n\nThe stock is also rebounding from its 10-week moving average, MarketSurge analysis shows. It is now clear of its 21-day exponential moving average and its 10-day line.\n\nInvestors can view last week's move as an early entry either from the 10-week line or breaking the downtrend of the handle.\n\nThe relative strength line is bending higher again, a bullish sign as it closes in on the buy point.\n\nLam Research stock is an excellent all-around performer, which is reflected in its near-perfect IBD Composite Rating of 98.\n\nFundamental performance is currently a key strength, with the stock holding an Earnings Per Share Rating of 94 out of 99.\n\nAnalysts see further profit growth ahead. Earnings are expected to rise 7% this year before accelerating 13% growth in 2026, MarketSurge data shows. Analysts have been revising their estimates upwards, a good sign.\n\nIt is also faring well on the technical front as it sits in the top 11% of issues in terms of price performance over the past 12 months. The stock has also rallied more than 60% so far in 2025.\n\nInstitutions have standing pat on their holdings of the stock lately, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating coming in at C.\n\nAt the moment, 52% of Lam Research stock is held by funds. The Franklin Growth Fund (FKGRX) and the JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) are among the noteworthy backers.\n\nLam Research supplies wafer fabrication equipment to the semiconductor industry. Back in June, Oppenheimer analyst Edward Yang reiterated his outperform rating on the stock and hiked his price target to 110 from 80.\n\nYang said company has \"a clear line-of-sight into an unusually large, multiyear $40 billion NAND (memory chip) upgrade wave,\". Lam also is positioned to benefit from AI-fueled demand for its 3D scaling technology in deposition and etch tools, he said.\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners? Start With These 3 Steps\n\nLas Vegas Sands Stock\n\nThe casino stock formed a cup-with-handle base and is now clearing the actionable zone above a 50.67 buy point. LVS stock has forged a three-weeks-tight within the buy zone, which offers a higher entry of 53.58.\n\nThe 50-day moving average is now the clearing the 200-day line, a bullish technical maneuver known as a 'golden cross.'\n\nThe RS line has been thrusting upwards of late, a good sign as it makes a breakout attempt.\n\nLVS stock has a strong, but not ideal, IBD Composite Rating of of 88. This is a reflection of good all-around performance.\n\nThe stock is only among the top 13% of issues in terms of price performance over the past 12 months. But it has been on something of a tear of late, rallying 79% from recent lows.\n\nEarnings performance is the biggest weak spot, with the stock holding an EPS Rating of 44 out of 99. However it snapped a three-quarter streak of earnings declines in the most recent quarter. EPS popped 44% to 79 cents.\n\nWall Street sees earnings rising 21% in 2025 before rising a further 10% next year.\n\nInstitutions have adding to their holdings of LVS stock of late, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating coming in at B+.\n\nThe number of firms holding shares in Las Vegas Sands is extremely strong at the moment, according to MarketSurge data. In total, 87% of its stock is held by funds.\n\nThe well-respected Janus Henderson Forty Fund (JARTX) is also among the current holders of the gaming play.\n\nThe company divested itself of its Sin City properties back in 2022. All of its earnings now come from Asia, where it runs properties such as Sands Macao, Londoner Macao, Four Seasons Hotel Macao and Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.\n\nDespite this, it is the biggest operator of fully integrated resorts on the planet.\n\nUrban Outfitters Stock\n\nThe clothing and home decor stock is near the top of the buy zone from a cup-with-handle base entry of 74.45. This is an early-stage pattern, a plus.\n\nShares have rebounded from their 10-week line and previously broke the downtrend of the handle, which offered an early entry.\n\nThe stock's 50-day moving average is pulling away from its 200-day line, a bullish sign. The relative strength line has come off highs during the base-building phase.\n\nShares have bounced back after finding support at the 10-week line. They have also been getting support of late at the 21-day line.\n\nOverall performance is top class, with its IBD Composite Rating sitting at 97 out of 99. It also sits near the top of the competitive apparel industry group.\n\nEarnings performance is its strongest suit at the moment, with its EPS Rating sitting a near-perfect 98. In addition, earnings have grown by an average of 48% over the past three quarters.\n\nProfits are seen popping 23% in the current fiscal year, before slowing to 10% growth the next, MarketSurge data shows.\n\nHowever, it is not slouch technically. It is among the top 5% of stocks in terms of price performance over the past 12 months and is up more than 41% already in 2025.\n\nInstitutions have also been loading up on the stock of late, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating sitting at B-. Funds currently hold 66% of shares in the company. The acclaimed Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) is among the noteworthy backers.\n\nThe company's most recent earnings report defied expectations of softer consumer trends. The retailer described customers as \"resilient\" and eager for spring fashion.\n\nApril-ended quarter sales rose 10.7% to $1.33 billion while earnings per share jumped 78.5% to $1.16. It was the second straight quarter of strong revenue gains and the third consecutive quarter of accelerating EPS growth.\n\nUrban Outfitters has more than 700 stores globally under the Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement, Urban Outfitters, Nuuly and other brands.\n\nStocks Run On Fed Bets, 7 New Buys\n\nRollins Stock\n\nThe pest control stock is flirting with a flat base ideal entry of 58.65, MarketSurge analysis shows.\n\nThe relative strength line is off recent lows, a positive. It has also bullishly reclaimed its 50-day moving average and now sits above the 21-day line.\n\nROL is an excellent all-around performer, which is reflected in its IBD Composite Rating of 97.\n\nPrice performance is its weakest feature, though Rollins is still among the top 22% of issues in terms of gains over the past 12 months. So far in 2025, it is up nearly 25%, which is excellent.\n\nFundamental performance is strong, with its EPS Rating coming in at 89 out of 99. In the most recent quarter earnings popped 11% to 30 cents per share while revenue climbed 12% to $1 billion.\n\nAnalysts see EPS rising 11% this year to $1.10, with a further 13% advance next year.\n\nInstitutions have been adding to their holdings of the stock lately, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating coming in at B+.\n\nNevertheless, Rollins stock boasts a relatively lackluster level of institutional backing. Funds currently hold 30% of shares, MarketSurge data shows.\n\nHowever, the lauded Baron Asset Fund (BARAX) and the Virtus KAR Mid-Cap Growth Fund (PHSKX) are among the noteworthy holders.\n\nRollins is probably the largest bug killer in the world. It owns Orkin, Critter Control and many other insect and termite extermination companies in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.\n\nIts strong recent earnings report saw UBS, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Piper Sandler raised their price targets on the stock. Sandler said consumer demand remains strong, and June strength has continued into July. The second half of the year also shows potential for acceleration in organic sales.\n\nPlease follow Michael Larkin on X at @IBD_MLarkin for more analysis of growth stocks.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\n\nThis China Stock Is Near An Entry After A 30% Gain\n\nDow Leader, Magnificent Seven Stock In New Buy Zones\n\nJoin IBD Live Each Morning For Stock Tips Before The Open\n\nMarketSurge: Research, Charts, Data And Coaching All In One Place\n\nThis Is The Ultimate Warren Buffett Stock, But Should You Buy It?", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:58:43.222869+00:00"}

The US Justice Department has proposed as a remedy that Google sell its Chrome browser.\n\nGoogle has promised to appeal the ruling and called the idea of spinning off Chrome an “unprecedented proposal” that it says would harm consumers and security. Google declined to provide a comment to CNN regarding Perplexity’s bid.\n\nPerplexity’s offer — while likely a long shot, given Google’s resistance to a forced sale of Chrome — marks the latest example of how new firms are taking on tech’s biggest players to reshape the internet in the AI era.\n\nPerplexity is a nearly three-year-old startup whose search tool uses AI models to parse web content and curate answers. Answers are usually posted as a summary, although Perplexity does provide links to its sources. It launched an AI search engine that competes with Google’s dominant offering in December 2022.\n\nPerplexity launched its own AI-powered web browser called Comet in July. The company is pitching it as a more personalized browser that connects the dots between a user’s calendars, browsing tabs, social channels and more. OpenAI is also said to be developing a web browser, according to Reuters, in yet another signal that AI companies are looking to play a bigger role in how people use the web.\n\nPerplexity said it would maintain users’ current browsing preferences, including Google as the default search engine, if it were to buy Chrome, Dwyer told CNN.\n\nIt would also commit to “continued available and support” for Chrome for 100 months and investing $3 billion in Chromium over the next 24 months, according to Dwyer. Chromium is Google’s open-source underlying technology that other tech companies – including Microsoft and Perplexity – can use to build their own browsers.\n\nPerplexity made the offer because it “believes in the open web,” Dwyer said.\n\nPerplexity was most recently valued at $18 billion following a $100 million funding round, Bloomberg said in a report last month, citing a person familiar with the matter. The company did not comment on the report.\n\nThat makes Perplexity’s offer for Chrome worth nearly double its own valuation. Google, meanwhile, is worth nearly $2.5 trillion; shares of the company (GOOGL) rose around 1% on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported that several investors have agreed to back the purchase, including large venture capital firms.\n\n“This is a smart and opportunistic move by Perplexity given the case against Google and regulatory scrutiny,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told CNN, adding that he estimates Chrome is worth at least $50 billion. “This is all a game of high stakes poker and Perplexity made a good move.”\n\nGoogle Chrome isn’t the only high profile acquisition target that Perplexity has pursued. The company said earlier this year it was making a bid to buy TikTok, after a law was passed last year requiring the social media app’s parent company, ByteDance, to sell it to a non-China-based company or face a ban in the United States.\n\nPerplexity has also reportedly been eyeballed by bigger tech players — both Meta and Apple have had discussions about buying the AI search firm, according to reports from Bloomberg and The Information, although it’s not clear the talks will go anywhere.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:58:51.750032+00:00"}

After more than 17 years at the company, he departed to launch his own startup.\n\n“I was seeing how fast technology was changing, and I felt there are certain ideas that are best explored in the context of a startup,” Petrou told TechCrunch.\n\nHis ultimate idea was to build Continua, a consumer-facing company that uses AI agents to enhance collaboration and interaction in group chats on SMS, iMessage, and Discord.\n\n“The simple way to think about it is that we’re bringing the power of LLMs to group chats,” Petrou said.\n\nContinua announced on Tuesday that it has raised an $8 million seed round. The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors.\n\nWhen developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation.\n\n“If you and I are planning a trip, or if we’re trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said.\n\nContinua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it’s needed.\n\nAs the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists.\n\nIf a user forgets details from the group chat, such as the meeting time or location, they can simply direct message Continua to privately ask for the information.\n\nAt first glance, Continua may seem like a straightforward application of AI, but Petrou says that getting LLMs to participate in a conversation with multiple humans is a rather complex technical problem. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune LLMs to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.\n\nContinua\n\nFor instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.\n\n“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM’s brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.\n\nUsers can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it’s chiming in too often.\n\nUsers can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:58:53.785172+00:00"}

Perplexity’s offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project.\n\nPerplexity is also promising not to change the user defaults of Chrome users, including the default search engine. That is, Perplexity is promising to leave Google as the search engine rather than making its own AI-powered option the default.\n\nGoogle could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds.\n\nThis bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that Google be forced to sell Chrome after a judge ruled the tech giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has not agreed to sell Chrome and has vowed to fight the ruling.\n\nThe Perplexity spokesperson believes the court will soon set terms for remedies, perhaps later this month. (Google is also fighting another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.)\n\nWhen the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, both OpenAI and Perplexity expressed interest in buying it. Given that Chrome is the dominant browser, with 68% marketshare according to Statcounter, if the court rules Chrome must be sold, no doubt others worldwide would want to bid as well.\n\nInterestingly, the CEO of rival search engine DuckDuckGo testified in April that Chrome could be worth “upwards of $50 billion,” Bloomberg reported at the time. Should Perplexity’s offer succeed, it could be considered a bargain.\n\nStill, this offer for Chrome is far more than Perplexity has raised from investors and more than the startup’s current valuation. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, PitchBook estimates, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month that valued it at $18 billion, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn the meantime, Perplexity last month launched its own browser, called Comet, in its bid to grow its AI search business without having to serve its customers through a browser, particularly one owned by its main rival Google.\n\nAnd, by the way, last month, Perplexity also reportedly submitted a bid to merge with TikTok.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:58:55.595026+00:00"}

Perplexity said several investors have agreed to back a Chrome deal.\n\nJudge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia in a 2024 ruling declared Google a monopolist in internet search. Mehta ruled that Alphabet illegally maintained a monopoly over online search services and prevented rivals from developing their own products.\n\nMehta earlier this year held hearings over what legal remedies should be taken.\n\nThe Department of Justice has asked Mehta to order Alphabet to sell its Chrome browser. Google is likely to appeal the 2024 ruling as well as whatever Mehta does in terms of legal remedies.\n\n\"We suppose it's plausible for investors to regard this as potentially raising the odds of a forced sale of Chrome, however, we don't think this type of pre-emptive action would influence the judge,\" said RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson in a report. \"Further, the potential values being thrown out seem low, in our view — potentially by an order of magnitude given the value unlock it arguably provides for Google.\n\nHe added that well financed OpenAI would be a more formidable bidder for the Chrome product. \"We believe the judge is fully aware there are willing and able buyers — one in particular with a valuation of more than 15 times that of Perplexity,\" Erickson said.\n\nOn the stock market today, Google stock rose more than 1% to 203.93 in midday trading.

Invalid clicks can increase ad costs, and skew your metrics, without producing any real result. And while Google does have regulations to combat this, ultimately, it’s up to publishers to ensure that their ad clicks are relevant.\n\nBut Google is looking to provide more assistance, with its latest AI tools now better able to detect traffic from invalid sources.\n\nAs explained by Google:\n\n“We've long used AI to fight IVT, and new applications are further improving our results. Our Ad Traffic Quality team, with Google Research and Google DeepMind, recently introduced industry-leading defenses powered by large language models to more precisely identify ad placements generating invalid behaviors.”\n\nGoogle says that its updated systems provide stronger protections by analyzing app and web content, ad placements and user interactions.\n\n“For example, they've significantly improved our content review capabilities, leading to a 40% reduction in IVT stemming from deceptive or disruptive ad serving practices. This helps advertisers better reach their intended audiences and keeps policy violators off our platforms.”\n\nThat should, at least in theory, see a reduction in Google Ads costs, while also ensuring that you’re reaching more of your actual target audience with your promotions.\n\nGoogle says that it also runs “extensive automated and manual checks” to ensure advertisers aren't charged for IVT, even if an ad serves.\n\nIn combination, these measures should help improve your Google Ads experience, and maximize your results, by reducing false indicators of engagement.\n\nAnd when you also combine this with improving AI targeting, you should be more assured of reaching more actual people with your promotions.

The unsolicited bid, which Perplexity confirmed to the newspaper, is far in excess of Perplexity’s own $18 billion valuation and comes at a pivotal moment for both companies: Perplexity recently unveiled its own AI-native search browser, called Comet, last month, an explicit move to take on Google Chrome. Meanwhile, Google’s own fate is up in the air as a federal judge weighs what remedies should follow from the 2024 ruling that Google had illegally monopolized the search market.\n\nPerplexity said in a statement to the Journal that its bid is “designed to satisfy an antitrust remedy in highest public interest by placing Chrome with a capable, independent operator.”\n\nThe Justice Department’s antitrust case against Google, which began in 2020, accused the company of unlawfully suppressing competition by locking in default search deals with device manufacturers and browser developers. Last year, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google had, in fact, monopolized the search market through anticompetitive tactics. Among the most consequential is exactly what Perplexity is proposing: whether Google should be compelled to divest Chrome, a browser installed on billions of devices and accounting for well over 60% of global browser usage.\n\nChrome, of course, is more than just a web browser; it’s a strategic linchpin connecting users to Google Search and a treasure trove of data fueling Google’s $2 trillion advertising apparatus. Chrome’s size—about 3.5 billion users—positions it at the fulcrum of both user data collection and default search engine placement. The sale of Chrome is one of the Department of Justice’s top recommendations as a Google remedy.\n\nFor what it’s worth, DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg recently testified in court that Chrome could be worth upwards of $50 billion; some analysts offer more conservative estimates for its valuation, around $20 billion. Perplexity’s bid, at $34.5 billion, lands squarely within that range.\n\nPerplexity’s rationale\n\nPerplexity, which has evolved from a little-known startup in 2022 to a high-profile competitor with an $18 billion valuation, now hosts about 30 million monthly active users and generates roughly $150 million in annual revenue. Its core product—a real-time AI-powered search engine with source citations—is positioned as a challenger to traditional search engines and leading AI assistants such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude.

Following the leak of renders showcasing the third rear lens, Google released a teaser for the Pixel 10, confirming the substantial camera upgrade.\n\nAdditionally, all phones in the lineup are expected to be powered by a new Tensor G5 processor, ushering in the Gemini era and enhancing performance and power efficiency compared to the Tensor G4 chip.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nAside from these updates, not many obvious changes appear to be on the table.

At the end of 2025, Apple Intelligence will be available in eight more languages: Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (traditional) and Vietnamese. At this year’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced new Apple Intelligence features like Live Translation, updates to visual intelligence, as well as enhancements to Image Playground and Genmoji. Shortcuts can access Apple Intelligence directly. Developers also get access to the on-device large language model, which is at the core of Apple Intelligence. The latest features are now available for testing and are expected to be generally available this fall with supported devices.

Apple is benefiting from the growing adoption of Apple Intelligence that is infused across iPhone, Mac, and iPad. The company reported record June quarter revenues in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the United States, Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. The robust performance was driven by double-digit growth across iPhone (13.5% year over year), Mac (14.8% year over year) and Services (13.3% year over year). For iPhone, Apple saw double-digit growth in emerging markets, including India, the Middle East, South Asia and Brazil. Services grew double-digit in both developed and emerging markets. Apple Intelligence is playing a key role in driving this growth thanks to the addition of more than 20 features that include visual intelligence, cleanup and powerful writing tools. Although Apple continues to play catch-up in the AI domain against Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOGL, the third-quarter 2025 results reflect encouraging progress. Year to date (YTD), Apple shares are down 9.2%, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 13.5% and the trio.

In the next four years, AAPL plans to directly hire 20,000 people in the U.S. in roles including research and development, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning.\n\n\n\nApple’s accelerating U.S. investments are expected to appease U.S. President Donald Trump, who has criticized the iPhone maker’s strategy of manufacturing iPhones sold in the United States in other countries, including India. The latest announcement is expected to help Apple escape potential tariff threats.\n\n\n\nTariffs are currently expected to have a negative impact of roughly $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Apple expects gross margin between 46% and 47% for the current quarter compared with a gross margin of 46.5% in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nApple’s Q4 Revenues to Grow Amid Tariff Threats\n\nApple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2025) net sales to grow mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. The company expects the Services year-over-year growth rate to be similar to that of the June quarter.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $100.37 billion, indicating 5.73% growth over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.

TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s challenges in kind.\n\nAnthropic’s escalation — a response to OpenAI’s attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company’s foothold in federal AI usage.\n\n“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we’re helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”\n\nAnthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government. The latter supports FedRAMP High workloads so that federal workers can use Claude for handling sensitive unclassified work, according to the company.\n\nFedRAMP High is a stringent security baseline within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for handling unclassified sensitive government data.\n\nAnthropic will also provide technical support to help agencies integrate AI tools into their workflows, according to the company.\n\nAnthropic, along with OpenAI, xAI, and Google, has been granted up to $200 million by the Department of Defense to leverage AI for national security, but the AI firm clearly hopes to integrate into a broader array of government work, including science research and health services. Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages.\n\nAnthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government’s highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:59:11.856238+00:00"}

Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. My Spotify playlists are undergoing a British invasion this week. Here’s what I’m listening to: PinkPantheress, Lola Young and Evita in London.\n\nPrivileges with the president\n\nDonald Trump announced this week that two US chipmakers would tithe 15% of their revenue from sales in China to the US government. Paying for the license to sell to Chinese customers represents an unprecedented deal.\n\nMy colleague Helen Davidson reports from Taipei:\n\nThe chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the US government 15% of their revenue from advanced chips sold to China in return for export licences to the key market.\n\nThe arrangement will lead to Nvidia giving 15% of its revenue from Chinese sales of its H20 chips, and AMD giving 15% of revenue from Chinese sales of its MI308 chips, according to reports citing US officials.\n\nThe H20 and MI308 chips were banned from sale to China in April, despite the lower-powered H20 being designed specifically to abide by restrictions introduced by the Biden administration.\n\nNvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, head of the most valuable company in the world at $4.44tn, has been lobbying the White House for months to open up sales in China, where the US still prohibits sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips over national security concerns. In July, Trump relaxed some restrictions imposed by Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nThe deal with Nvidia and AMD seems as much about personally appealing to Trump as it does about generating revenue for the US government. The agreement has all the trappings of Trump entering into business with the chipmakers.\n\nIn a way, it’s a version of a playbook other major tech companies have been trying out as Trump is dramatically changing the international business landscape. Apple announced a $100bn investment commitment in US manufacturing. CEO Tim Cook, who had made the journey to the White House himself, presented Trump with a glass trophy (including 24 karat gold base) designating the president a graduate of the Apple Manufacturing Academy, launched in Michigan the week prior.\n\nDuring his meeting with Cook, Trump said he would levy a 100% tariff on semiconductor chips, which could set both Apple and Nvidia back billions. However, the president said: “If you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.”\n\nBoth Nvidia and Apple are likely to be exempted from the tariffs. Each appears to have paid for the privilege – Apple with its domestic investment, Nvidia with its revenue-sharing agreement.\n\nOpenAI debuts GPT-5\n\nOpenAI launched the new version of the artificial intelligence that underpins ChatGPT last week. There are quite a few aspects of the release to consider to understand it fully – what the company is saying, where the AI race between tech giants stands, the model’s new capabilities and pitfalls, the environmental impact – so I’ve rounded up the Guardian’s coverage of GPT-5 below.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:59:21.191644+00:00"}

Revenues increased 19% year over year to $694 billion and beat the consensus mark by 1.4%. This came above the company’s revenue expectation of at least $682 million. Connected TV or CTV once again emerged as the fastest-growing channel, driven by expanding partnerships with major media players, such as Disney, NBCU, Netflix, Roku and Walmart. Kokai continues to deliver strong performance.\n\nOn the profitability front, adjusted EBITDA came in at $271 million compared with $242 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS was 41 cents, missing estimates but up from 39 cents in the year-ago quarter, with free cash flow at $117 million.\n\nNonetheless, intense competition in the ad tech space amid increasing macroeconomic uncertainty are keeping investors on the sidelines. So, now the question arises whether investors should remain invested in TTD stock or book profits and exit. Let’s unpack the pros and cons and ascertain the best way forward.\n\nFactors Driving Growth for TTD\n\nIncreasing digital spending in CTV remains a key growth driver. CTV, along with retail media, accounted for much of the company’s growth, supported by The Trade Desk’s decision-based programmatic approach, which delivers better returns compared with insertion order or programmatic guaranteed buying.\n\nIn the second quarter, Video, which includes connected CTV, accounted for a high-40s percentage of its overall business and continues to increase its share of the mix in the quarter. Mobile contributed a mid-30s percentage share of total spend, while display made up a low double-digit share and audio comprised approximately 5%.\n\nApart from CTV, momentum in retail media, international expansion, the Kokai platform, and efforts to strengthen go-to-market capabilities are other tailwinds.\n\nMore than 70% of the clients are now using the company’s Kokai platform, with full client adoption expected to be completed by this year. Trade Desk highlighted that Samsung saw a 43% improvement in audience targeting efficiency for an omnichannel, while Cashrewards experienced a 73% improvement in cost per acquisition for campaigns in Asia. Adding Koa AI technology across the platform is expected to aid in attracting more clients.\n\nComplementing Kokai, OpenPath is simplifying the programmatic supply chain by allowing publishers to integrate directly with The Trade Desk’s platform. Sincera's acquisition is enhancing supply chain transparency through OpenSincera, which makes data available to the ecosystem for free. TTD is also upbeat about Deal Desk, which is currently in the beta stage. Deal Desk leverages AI forecasting to optimize deals and re-route underperforming deals to better open market and premium internet alternatives.

Profound says 2,000 marketers from over 500 organizations now use its platform daily as brands race to secure their place in the AI-first internet. And the race is heating up: According to the Wall Street Journal, AI-powered chatbots now account for more than 5% of U.S. desktop search traffic—up from just 1.3% in early 2024.\n\nSequoia partner Anas Biad told Fortune the firm’s big bet is on cofounders James Cadwallader, a serial marketing entrepreneur, and Dylan Babbs, a former Uber software engineer. The two met at South Park Commons, a San Francisco community and early-stage fund founded in 2016 by Ruchi Sanghvi, Facebook’s first female engineer, and Aditya Agarwal, former Dropbox CTO. Sequoia views the rise of AI search as a once-in-a-generation platform shift for marketers—one it believes Profound is poised to lead by helping brands monitor how they and their competitors surface in AI-generated results and produce new content to keep pace.\n\n“Their speed of execution was truly remarkable—in both the product they built and the customers they landed,” said Biad. “We only back founders who want to build generational companies. Their team is very ambitious and very aggressive.”\n\nCadwallader, who previously founded influencer marketing firm Kyra, has called the change a “Game of Thrones power shift” from decades of search engine optimization tactics to a new world of AI search. He said he became “obsessed” with Perplexity in early 2024. “It was so obvious to me that this was an inflection point—once you’ve used AI to search, you quickly understand why our children won’t be using [Google’s] blue links.”\n\nBut the shift is bigger than search, he emphasized: It will change the internet itself and become a boardroom-level problem for every marketer. If AI chatbots become the primary way people search, brands will lose direct visibility and control over how they appear to consumers online. That’s not just a marketing issue, he explained—it’s a business challenge that touches revenue, customer acquisition, competitive positioning, and brand identity.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T09:59:36.557860+00:00"}

It has since recovered some of those losses but remains up just slightly year-to-date -- underperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nHere's why Amazon is out of favor, along with the biggest mistake investors make when buying the growth stock.\n\nAmazon's underwhelming guidance\n\nAmazon reported excellent quarterly results, including growing operating income far faster than revenue. However, its third-quarter guidance and anticipated growth slowdown in Amazon Web Services (AWS) may be reasons for the stock's pullback. The AWS results are particularly jarring, considering Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) Azure and Alphabet's (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) Google Cloud are growing more quickly than AWS.\n\nWhat's more, Amazon's free cash flow plummeted to $18.2 billion for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $53 billion for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024. The company is deploying excess cash back into the business to invest in big ideas, such as building out AWS data centers, launching generative AI tools, expanding Amazon Prime delivery capabilities, and more. And yet, Amazon's third-quarter guidance calls for just 10% to 13% revenue growth and between an 11% decline in operating income and an 18% increase.\n\nAmazon's aggressive capital allocation strategy\n\nThe biggest mistake investors make when buying Amazon stock is not realizing that the company's modus operandi is plowing profits back into innovative ideas rather than booking short-term profits. Amazon takes a lot of risks, most of which have paid off and led to phenomenal long-term gains for patient investors. But this strategy also produces inconsistent earnings per share and cash flow. Amazon has fallen at least 25% from its all-time high three times in the last decade -- showcasing the stock's volatility.\n\nAmazon's stock-based compensation regularly exceeds its buybacks. Amazon hasn't repurchased stock in years, and it doesn't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, its stock-based compensation is over $20 billion for the trailing 12 months, and its outstanding share count continues to climb as Amazon dilutes existing shareholders.\n\nThis is a far different approach from other big tech giants like Apple (AAPL 1.13%), Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (META 3.16%). Like Amazon, these tech giants shell out billions in stock-based compensation each year to attract top talent, but they more than offset this expense with buybacks, which avoid dilution. In fact, having buybacks outpace stock-based compensation accelerates earnings growth by lowering the number of outstanding shares.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is ramping up spending in the pursuit of long-term growth. As you can see in the following chart, the company has grown its operating income at an impeccable pace over the last five years, but it has also magnified its capital expenditures.\n\nAWS remains the undisputed leader in the global cloud market, but its dominant market share is partly due to its entrenched position in the industry. In this vein, Amazon is making the right decision to reinvest profits in AWS to expand capacity and build out its AI capacity to bolster its competitive advantages. But investors will want to see these investments pay off.\n\nThe good news is that Amazon's valuation has gotten much more attractive as its earnings have grown and the stock price has stagnated. Amazon commands a 33.9 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- which is nearly identical to Microsoft's 33.6 forward P/E ratio.\n\nThe best way to approach Amazon stock\n\nInvestors who buy and hold Amazon stock must do so for the right reasons. Amazon's capital spending is surging, and if Wall Street doesn't see these investments pay off, the stock could keep tumbling.\n\nAmazon tends to get a shorter leash than other mega-cap names, so buying the stock requires a high risk tolerance. But this shorter leash is by design, as Amazon could easily pull back on spending and boost its cash flow or return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\n\nInvestors looking for a company with a more balanced capital allocation may want to consider Microsoft or Alphabet as preferred cloud plays over Amazon. However, Amazon is a decent valuation for folks looking to invest in the cloud and who believe in the strength of Amazon's core e-commerce and advertising business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:00:00.130762+00:00"}

During a presentation to the board, Tract Senior Director, Entitlements Kristin Dean said the Mooresville Technology Park would create 277 \"recession-resistant\" jobs, 195 of them paying more than $125,000 a year.

Earnings were $2.31 per share compared with a Bloomberg consensus estimate of $2.18.\n\nOn a business segment level, advertising revenue came in at $71.3bn versus expectations of $69.6bn. Search revenue topped out at $54.1bn versus an anticipated $52.7bn. YouTube ad revenue was $9.8bn versus expectations of $9.5bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud Platform revenue hit $13.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $13.1bn.\n\nThe company's outlook for capital expenditures (capex), however, was higher than expected. The tech giant expects to spend $85bn in the year, $10bn more than had been previously expected.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nBen Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"Given the concerns around disruption from artificial intelligence and ChatGPT, Alphabet produced a really good set of numbers in its latest results. Revenues were up 15%, three percentage points better than expected and the search business delivered at the top of its range. The cloud business, meanwhile, was also a strong performer with revenues up 32% so it is encouraging to see the business growing strongly in the face of pressures.\"\n\nHe said that the increase in its capex guidance \"is a very solid raise and should be viewed as a positive, with investment looking to drive away the threat of Chat GPT\".\n\n\"Alphabet has been playing catch up somewhat in the AI arms race, but it is doing well to fend off the likes of Chat GPT,\" said Barringer. \"The big question will be whether it can keep innovating at a pace that allows it to maintain its search monopoly. This boost in investment suggests the fight will continue.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the next big event on the horizon for Alphabet's Google is a judge's ruling in an search antitrust case. Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia is expected to issue a ruling on \"remedies\" that follows the Justice Department's victory against the company sometime next month.\n\n\"While it is unlikely to be the end of the saga regardless of the result, any indication that its search monopoly will weaken will not be taken well by the market, especially given the AI threat currently,\" said Barringer. \"This ruling has the potential to either be a clearing event or add to Alphabet’s uncertainties.

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $3.65 compared to expectations of $3.37.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes the Azure cloud, produced $29.88bn in revenue in the final quarter. For the entire fiscal year, this AI division saw revenue surge 34% to a record $75bn.\n\nThe company predicted its capital expenditure for the next fiscal year would top $100bn, a 14% increase from the year prior.\n\nRead more: Shell announces further $3.5bn in share buybacks as profits beat estimates\n\nIt’s the fifth quarter in a row that Microsoft has beaten Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nBarringer said that \"while AI demand is clearly helping Microsoft, it isn’t the only game in town for the tech giant. Its cloud business, Azure, saw revenues grow 39%, well ahead of expectations, highlighting that demand for more traditional cloud based services remains strong. Microsoft has a good backlog in this business area too so we should see strong results continue to flow there.\n\n“The company did announce it was slowing the growth of its capex and changing the mix slightly, but as demand remains strong for AI we will likely see the likes of data centres take priority for a number of years yet.\n\nMeta (META) – Released second quarter results on Wednesday 30 July\n\nFacebook-parent Meta (META) surged 12% on Thursday after posting a bumper set of results after the market close on 30 July.\n\nMeta said revenue for the three months to the end of June rose 22% from the same period last year to $47.5bn. Meanwhile, profits jumped by 36% to $18.3bn. Profit per share came in at $7.14, above analysts' estimates.\n\nThe company said it expected its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114bn and $118bn. The company added its AI initiatives will “result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.”\n\n\"I think there are all these questions that people have about what are going to be the timelines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence ... we've observed the more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen. I think that that just continued to happen over the course of this year too,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nReality Labs logged an operating loss of $4.53bn while recording $370m in sales during the same period. This division oversees the Quest line of virtual reality headsets in addition to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company plans to build several massive data centres across the US. · Reuters / Reuters\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Meta has knocked it out of the park. Pick your metric and Meta crushed it, from ad revenue growth to daily users, all the way down to the profit lines.\n\n\"AI is clearly delivering real-world benefits for advertisers, and they're willing to pay more as a result. Average price per ad was up 9% over the quarter, a clear indication that Meta is delivering an improved product for both users and advertisers.\n\n\"The broader focus now turns to Meta's mammoth AI investment plans and whether it can continue to manage those costs without hurting earnings or free cash flow.\n\n\"CFO commentary called out higher costs next year, and another year of similar capex growth, which many analysts did not have on their bingo cards. Clearly, all this spending adds some near-term risks to the bottom line, but Meta looks set to be a clear winner in the AI space over the longer term.\"\n\nApple (AAPL) – Released third-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nInvestors in Apple (AAPL) had a muted response to its latest earnings in after-hours trading following their release, despite a surge in iPhone sales driving record revenue at the Cupertino-based company.\n\nThe company posted better-than-expected 10% growth in revenue year-on-year for the quarter to the end of June and an upbeat forecast.\n\nEarnings of $1.57 per share topped the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $1.43. Revenue of $94.04bn was better than the expected $89.30bn. Mac and iPhone revenue were both better than analysts had anticipated, while wearables and iPad numbers fell short. Greater China revenue was $15.37bn compared to an estimate of $15.19bn.\n\nApple expects tariffs to cost the company $1.1bn this quarter, CEO Tim Cook told investors on the earnings call. That's after the iPhone maker took a tariff-related hit to the tune of $800m during the fiscal third quarter which ran through June.\n\nServices revenue, which includes the App Store, iCloud and Apple Pay, came in at $27.4bn, up about 13% year-on-year, continuing its double-digit growth.\n\nCook said Apple (AAPL) was increasing its AI investments. “We did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter,” he told analysts, without giving specific numbers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook warned in a second quarter earnings call at the beginning of May that tariffs were expected to add $900m to costs in the third quarter. · REUTERS / Reuters\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Britzman said: \"Apple is caught in a sentiment trap. On paper, the company delivered one of its strongest sets of results in recent years – robust iPhone sales, a return to growth in China, and encouraging guidance. Ordinarily, that would send shares meaningfully higher. There’s a sense of unease hanging over Apple, something we haven’t seen in a long time. Scepticism around its AI positioning, combined with lingering tariff uncertainty, continues to weigh on investor confidence.\"\n\n\"Apple should be a leading name in AI hardware, but that’s simply not the case,\" he added. \"Apple Intelligence was a flop, so a lot of hope now lies in an AI-powered Siri – but that might not come until next year. Brand loyalty gives Apple time to get the AI transition right, but it needs to start delivering.\"\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – Released second-quarter results on Thursday 31 July\n\nShares in Amazon (AMZN) fell on the back of its second quarter results, as its outlook for operating income fell short of investor expectations.\n\nThe tech company beat estimates with its revenue up 13.3% year over year to $167.7bn. Market experts had estimated the company would report around $162bn in revenue and 9% growth. The company’s Amazon Web Services cloud computing division reported its sales reached $30.9bn in an increase of 17.5% year over year.\n\nHowever, Amazon projected that operating income in the third quarter would be $15.5bn-$20.5bn, which fell short of analyst expectations of $19.4bn.\n\nChief executive Andy Jassy warned of further uncertainty around Trump’s tariff policies and said he remained “unsure” who would absorb potentially higher costs over time.\n\nRead more: Should you invest in gold?\n\nHe also gave a clear indication that the e-commerce giant will continue its AI push. \"AI is going to be the biggest transformation of our lifetime,” he said during a call with analysts on Thursday. “Every single area of the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by AI.\"\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"Just as it looked as if investors were ready to go all-in to big tech again, Amazon has come along and spoiled the party. A negative reaction to its results and a lacklustre response to Apple’s numbers would suggest the market has become more discerning.\"\n\n\"It is spending big on AI infrastructure, leading to more subdued profit guidance than expected,\" he said. \"The retail side of its business is caught up in Trump’s spiderweb of tariffs, which creates ongoing uncertainty.\"\n\n“Competition remains fierce for cloud computing services and Amazon’s sales growth rate is struggling to match rivals Microsoft and Alphabet,\" Coatsworth added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – Releases second quarter results on Wednesday 27 August\n\nAs an enabler of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings have become a major event in the earnings calendar, with some build up to the release of its results as it tends to report later in the season.\n\nInvestor expectations have become increasingly high around Nvidia's earnings, with markets sensitive to any signs of slowdown for the chip giant.\n\nThe stock has seen a marked rebound following turbulence in the first few months of the year amid the DeepSeek AI market shock and Trump's tariff agenda.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed curbs on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China in April. Shares popped last week after the company said that it would resume sales of its H20 chips in China. Nvidia said that the US government had assured the company that licences will be granted, with the chipmaker adding that it hoped to start deliveries soon.\n\nThe recovery in Nvidia shares since mid-April lows has meant the stock is now up 25% year-to-date and recently saw the company become the first publicly traded company to pass the $4tn market capitalisation milestone.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia beat expectations, posting revenue of $44.1bn compared with an expected $43.29bn.

AAON’s backlog reached $1.12 billion in the latest quarter and averaged 71.9% year-on-year growth over the last two years. Because this number is better than its revenue growth, we can see the company accumulated more orders than it could fulfill and deferred revenue to the future. This could imply elevated demand for AAON’s products and services but raises concerns about capacity constraints.\n\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. AAON’s annualized revenue growth of 9.6% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\n\nA company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, AAON’s 20.3% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis.\n\nBacked by two million square feet of lab testing space, AAON (NASDAQ:AAON) makes heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment for different types of buildings.\n\n\"Our second quarter results fell short of our expectations and do not reflect the high standards we set for ourselves as an organization,\" said CEO Matt Tobolski.\n\nFree Cash Flow was -$57.62 million, down from $4.85 million in the same quarter last year\n\nOperating Margin: 7.6%, down from 21.7% in the same quarter last year\n\nRevenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $335.4 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $391.2 million\n\nIs now the time to buy AAON? Find out in our full research report .\n\nHeating and cooling solutions company AAON (NASDAQ:AAON) missed Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales flat year on year at $311.6 million. Next quarter’s revenue guidance of $335.4 million underwhelmed, coming in 14.3% below analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.22 per share was 32.5% below analysts’ consensus estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAON Backlog\n\nThis quarter, AAON missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 0.6% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $311.6 million of revenue. Company management is currently guiding for a 2.5% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\n\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 19.4% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is eye-popping and implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nAAON has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for an industrials business, boasting an average operating margin of 16.1%.\n\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, AAON’s operating margin decreased by 5.2 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\n\nAAON Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nIn Q2, AAON generated an operating margin profit margin of 7.6%, down 14.1 percentage points year on year. Since AAON’s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead increased.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nRevenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nAAON’s EPS grew at a solid 11.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. However, this performance was lower than its 20.3% annualized revenue growth, telling us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\nAAON Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\nWe can take a deeper look into AAON’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, AAON’s operating margin declined by 5.2 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 4.8%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders.\n\nAAON Diluted Shares Outstanding\n\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\n\nFor AAON, its two-year annual EPS declines of 8.3% mark a reversal from its (seemingly) healthy five-year trend. We hope AAON can return to earnings growth in the future.\n\nIn Q2, AAON reported adjusted EPS at $0.22, down from $0.62 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts’ estimates, but we care more about long-term adjusted EPS growth than short-term movements. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects AAON’s full-year EPS of $1.52 to grow 58.1%.\n\nKey Takeaways from AAON’s Q2 Results\n\nWe struggled to find many positives in these results. Its revenue guidance for next quarter missed and its revenue fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 15.6% to $68 immediately following the results.\n\nAAON’s earnings report left more to be desired. Let’s look forward to see if this quarter has created an opportunity to buy the stock. What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

Because a large chunk of its sales comes from data center expenditures, Nvidia investors can look at what some of its largest clients are saying about their capital expenditure plans to determine if Nvidia has a bullish or bearish outlook.\n\nAfter some of the information investors received during the Q2 earnings announcement, it's pretty clear that Nvidia's stock will have another fantastic year. This makes Nvidia a potential buy before Aug. 27, when Nvidia reports its Q2 results.\n\nThe AI hyperscalers are still rapidly building data centers\n\nNvidia's business revolves around selling its graphics processing units (GPUs) and other supporting hardware and software. While GPUs are used in multiple applications, the largest demand by far comes from data centers being built to handle the demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Companies competing in the AI arms race are scrambling to ensure they have enough computing power to handle the workloads and are rapidly building data centers to meet it.\n\nSome of the biggest spenders in this area are Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. All three of these companies have already reported Q2 results and given bullish commentary regarding data center capital expenditures.\n\nStarting with Microsoft, they stated that capital expenditure growth won't be as rapid as it was in fiscal year 2025 (ending June 30), but will still increase for fiscal year 2026.\n\nAlphabet is probably displaying the most aggressive spending behavior of the three, raising its 2025 capital expenditure guidance from $75 billion to $85 billion. While they didn't give details on 2026's capex plans, they mentioned they will further increase this figure to meet customer demand.\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms' capital expenditures are expected to rise $30 billion year over year, with 2025's total expected to be between $66 billion and $72 billion, indicating that its capital expenditures have nearly doubled year over year. For 2026, Meta's management stated, \"We currently expect another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.\"\n\nWith strong guidance appearing for 2026, Nvidia will likely experience an additional year of strong growth as it receives a large chunk of that spend.\n\nHowever, Nvidia also has a growth lever up its sleeve.\n\nNvidia expects China sales to bolster its revenue growth rate moving forward\n\nIn April, Nvidia's China export license was revoked. This crippled sales of its H20 chip, which was specifically designed to meet export regulations. However, Nvidia has reapplied for an export license with assurances from the U.S. government that it will be approved. This is huge news and opens another growth avenue for Nvidia.\n\nFor Q2 of fiscal year 2025 (ended July 27), Nvidia expects 50% revenue growth. However, management estimated that H20 chips would have added around $8 billion in sales during Q2 if their export license hadn't been revoked. If nothing had happened, Nvidia's sales would have been estimated to rise 77% year over year.\n\nWith H20 chip sales likely returning in Q3, this will also bolster Nvidia's growth rate for the next year.\n\nNvidia has several strong tailwinds blowing in its favor that will push its revenue higher. So, if you're worried about Nvidia's growth slowing, I wouldn't be, as all signs point toward Nvidia's growth remaining strong for at least another couple of years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:00:39.425211+00:00"}

A 13F allows investors to track which stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Wall Street's brightest money managers have been buying and selling.\n\nBut hedge funds aren't the only big-time investors on Wall Street. The 13F requirement extends to businesses managing investment portfolios in excess of $100 million, such as Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%).\n\nAlphabet is best known for Google, its globally dominant internet search platform that generates boatloads of operating cash flow. Alphabet is the parent company of the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud), the second most visited social website (YouTube), and one of the most popular autonomous ride-hailing services (Waymo) as well.\n\nSomething else you can add to the list is that Alphabet is an avid investor. Based on the company's newly filed 13F, it closed out June with more than $2.1 billion invested across 36 companies, nearly all of which Alphabet has partnered with in some fashion or another.\n\nAs of the midpoint of 2025, a bona fide moonshot stock that's brimming with potential has become Alphabet's No. 1 holding. Meanwhile, a trusted company that once comprised 15% of its invested assets has been sent to the chopping block.\n\nAlphabet's new top holding has skyrocketed almost 2,000% in 15 months\n\nDuring the second quarter, Alphabet's investment wing didn't purchase a thing. But because of the ongoing outperformance of satellite-based cellular broadband services provider AST SpaceMobile (ASTS 8.36%), which has rallied close to 2,000% on a trailing-15-month basis, as of the closing bell on Aug. 7, this moonshot stock is now Alphabet's largest holding by market value (19.6% of invested assets).\n\nAlphabet bought 8,943,486 shares of AST SpaceMobile during the first quarter. Aside from being one of AST's financial backers, Alphabet likely has a trio of reasons to be optimistic about its long-term prospects.\n\nThe biggest differentiator for AST SpaceMobile is that its satellite-based cellular broadband service is designed to work with existing smartphones. Whereas prior-generation attempts to create satellite-based cellular networks often involved the need to use brick-like phones, AST's BlueBird satellites rely on current smartphone technology.\n\nRemoving this gigantic hurdle means AST SpaceMobile's management team can focus on getting satellites into space rather than convincing consumers they'll need new devices to access its network. The expectation is that four to six BlueBird Block 2 satellites will be launched monthly, with a target of 155 satellites in orbit by 2030.\n\nThe second catalyst that may have compelled Alphabet to pile in is AST SpaceMobile's ability to forge partnerships. By early 2024, it had secured agreements and understandings with more than 40 mobile network operators that collectively service north of 2 billion subscribers. Instead of going toe-to-toe with legacy telecom companies, it'll have a massive established customer base as its coverage ramps up.\n\nThirdly, Alphabet's investment team is likely intrigued by AST SpaceMobile's projected sales and profit growth. This year, Wall Street's consensus calls for roughly $62 million in sales and $1 in net loss per share. By 2028, analysts predict AST SpaceMobile will generate $1.93 billion in revenue and report in excess of $2.50 per share in earnings.\n\nWhile AST SpaceMobile has made for an exciting story stock, it's also priced for perfection. With a market cap of nearly $17 billion, as of this writing, there's simply no room for error. If satellite launches are in any way delayed, or if the cost of goods used to build its satellites increases, AST SpaceMobile stock could struggle.\n\nAlphabet's former core holding is sent packing\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Alphabet reduced its stake in one existing holding and completely exited five others during the June-ended quarter. None of these sales stands out more than artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled cybersecurity solutions provider CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 2.23%).\n\nBetween June 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, CrowdStrike was Alphabet's second-largest holding by market value and peaked at roughly 15% of invested assets. However, Alphabet's investment team persistently sold down this stake from a peak of 1,283,683 shares at the end of 2023 to just 74,230 shares by the end of March 2025. During the second quarter, Alphabet jettisoned all remaining shares of CrowdStrike.\n\nThe world's largest-ever IT outage, which was caused by a CrowdStrike software update in mid-July 2024, may be one reason Alphabet cashed in its chips. Customers of CrowdStrike's software-as-a-service solutions using the Windows operating system saw their platforms unable to boot up for an extended period of time. Even though CrowdStrike fixed its software update, there were concerns that customer retention and/or new customer creation would decline.\n\nAnother possible concern for Alphabet, from an investment standpoint, is CrowdStrike's premium valuation. Though companies with sustained competitive advantages (a point I'll touch on a bit more in a moment) are deserving of a premium, CrowdStrike is valued at approximately 90 times forward-year earnings and more than 19 times forward-year projected sales. There's little margin for error and a built-in expectation that it'll consistently blow Wall Street's consensus forecasts out of the water.\n\nBut while short-term upside in CrowdStrike's stock may be minimal, its long-term growth trajectory remains as strong as ever. Despite having one of the costlier cybersecurity product portfolios, its clients have willingly paid more for its services. Remember, its mid-July 2024 screw-up was entirely self-inflicted, with the company's AI-driven Falcon security platform exhibiting a phenomenal track record of stopping and identifying potential end-user breaches.\n\nCrowdStrike's operating results also show that its clients are expanding their services with the company. As of the end of April, nearly half (48%) of all its customers had purchased at least six cloud modules. A subscription-driven operating model has CrowdStrike targeting an 82% to 85% adjusted subscription gross margin.\n\nWhen looking back a decade from now, Alphabet's investment team may regret their sale of CrowdStrike Holdings' stock.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:00:41.166175+00:00"}

During its second-quarter earnings call, CFO Anat Ashkenazi said that it would spend $85 billion this year on capital expenditures, up from her prior outlook of $75 billion. Two-thirds of that would go toward servers for training and running large language models.\n\nBut Alphabet is also heavily invested in AI in other areas, including its CapitalG independent growth fund. The fund has $7 billion in assets under management, and it's been an early investor in several major companies (16 of which have made IPOs).\n\nAs of the end of Q2, the fund held 36 publicly traded stocks, according to its 13F filing with the SEC. That's down from 40 stocks held after the first quarter after fully divesting several holdings. One of those divested holdings is a major AI stock that CapitalG first invested in during its Series C in 2015. Instead, its parent company Alphabet has agreed to acquire a five-year-old start-up in the same space for $32 billion.\n\nTaking gains on one of this year's biggest winners\n\nOver the last two quarters, CapitalG has sold off its remaining shares of CrowdStrike. At the end of 2023, the fund held 1.3 million shares of the stock, and it accounted for 15% of the fund's marketable equity portfolio's value.\n\nBut CapitalG started selling off the stock as it rose in value in 2024. That summer, however, CrowdStrike suffered a massive outage, which sent the shares tanking more than 40% from its high. Once shares recovered to their previous high, CapitalG resumed selling.\n\nThe biggest factor in the investment team's decision to sell the stock appears to be valuation. That said, Alphabet's decision to acquire competing cloud security company Wiz in March may have pushed the team to complete its divestment.\n\nCrowdStrike is still recovering from the massive outage it experienced in July of last year. That's weighed heavily on its operating margin. The company has stepped up sales and marketing spend while offering customers discounts for purchasing multiple modules across its security platform. Non-GAAP operating margin fell to 18% in its most recent quarter, down from 23% a year ago.\n\nBut as CrowdStrike puts last year's outage in the rearview mirror, it's well positioned to expand its margins once again and accelerate earnings growth. Revenue continues to climb rapidly, up 42% year over year. That's bolstered by more customers taking multiple modules, with 48% using at least six of its products. That increases switching costs, and CrowdStrike's robust portfolio of solutions plays into the trend of vendor consolidation. As companies migrate more workloads to the cloud, they're looking for an all-in-one solution that can handle all their security needs, and CrowdStrike is well suited to meet that demand.\n\nCrowdStrike is also investing in agentic AI capabilities with its new Charlotte platform. The software can take swift action to curb security threats upon detection. That's built on top of CrowdStrike's machine learning algorithms used to detect security threats in the first place.\n\nBut even with the strong top-line growth, CrowdStrike shares currently trade for around 27 times sales. That makes it one of the most expensive stocks, by far, in the cybersecurity space. And with Alphabet's planned acquisition of Wiz, CrowdStrike's position in cloud security may be about to get a bit weaker.\n\nBuilding a more competitive cloud service\n\nGoogle currently operates the third-largest public cloud platform, Google Cloud. While it's growing quickly, it still trails its next-closest competitor, Microsoft's Azure, by a wide margin. Its Q2 run rate of $54.5 billion in cloud revenue is well behind Azure's $75 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025. Given that Microsoft's growing its sales faster than any company in the space, Google isn't going to catch up anytime soon.\n\nEmbedding Wiz's cloud security solutions into Google Cloud can add a new source of revenue for the company and increase its stickiness. That said, overdoing it and losing Wiz's overall neutrality when it comes to cloud platforms could lead some customers to shift to competing services like CrowdStrike. So finding the right balance will be key for Alphabet.\n\nWiz can benefit from Alphabet's ownership as well. It would gain access to more capital for investing in artificial intelligence, which is essential for identifying threats and closing vulnerabilities.\n\nOver time, Google Cloud could win share of cloud contracts in industries where security is of premium importance, such as government contracts or banking. While the $32 billion price tag for Wiz is extremely expensive, the potential for Google to grow the business and strengthen its cloud platform makes it worth it, especially since it's sitting on $95 billion of cash and marketable securities.\n\nShares of Alphabet look attractive at a forward price-to-earnings of less than 20. While it suffers from potential regulatory pressure, investors are getting a good value at the current price. If regulators approve the Wiz acquisition, it should bolster the fastest-growing segment of the business, making it an even better deal at this price.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:00:44.968229+00:00"}

I think all of these stocks are growing more interesting each day, but of the seven, I think five are a buy and two are to be watched.\n\nI'm keeping an eye on Apple and Tesla\n\nOver the past few years, many of these companies have delivered explosive revenue growth, except for Apple. Apple's growth finally returned in Q3 FY 2025, delivering double-digit growth (if you round up) for the first time since early 2022.\n\nStill, there are some questions about being behind in the AI arms race and what Apple's next big product is. I'm not ready to declare Apple a buy yet, but it's growing more intriguing with each quarter.\n\nTesla is in the worst shape of any Magnificent Seven company, with revenue falling 16% year over year in Q2. Additionally, with EV and regulatory credits getting eliminated, significant headwinds are popping up. However, Tesla's business has never been solely about EVs; otherwise, its valuation wouldn't make sense. An investment in Tesla is a bet that its humanoid robots, AI, self-driving, and rob-taxis will all be successes eventually. But for right now, I'm comfortable waiting on Tesla's situation to improve.\n\nI'm a buyer of the remaining five\n\nThe other five members of the Magnificent Seven all look promising to me, as they're all experiencing strong growth.\n\nMeta Platforms delivered a shocking Q2 report that delivered 22% revenue growth despite only guiding for 13% growth. That strength is expected to continue through Q3, with 20% revenue growth expected.\n\nMeta's advertising business is second to none, and the improvements it's making with AI to aid in ad creation and engagement are starting to pay off.\n\nAlphabet similarly had a strong advertising quarter, despite many investors being worried about Google Search potentially being left behind by generative AI. Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year, showcasing its strength and silencing doubters about its longevity.\n\nCompanywide, Alphabet's revenue rose 14% year over year, with diluted earnings per share rising 22%. That's an impressive result from a company that is supposed to be struggling. Additionally, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading for 20 times forward earnings.\n\nAll of this combines to make Alphabet one of the best stocks to buy right now.\n\nDespite Microsoft being the second-largest company in the world, it delivered monster growth in Q4 FY 2025 (ended June 30). Revenue was up 18% year over year, but the biggest shock in its report was Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing product and is a leading platform for building AI models. Azure's revenue was up a jaw-dropping 39% this quarter, showcasing strong demand for computing power.\n\nThis tailwind will persist for some time, making Microsoft an excellent stock to scoop up now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) investors had a negative reaction to its report, which caused shares to sink following earnings. However, I don't think they were as bad as the market thought, and the long-term outlook is still positive for the company.\n\nAmazon's profit growth continues to outpace revenue growth thanks to the strength of high-margin businesses like advertising and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAs long as this trend continues, Amazon will be a strong long-term pick. With both advertising and AWS being Amazon's fastest-growing segments by far, this trend looks primed to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nLast is Nvidia, which hasn't reported earnings yet. However, all of the companies involved in building out AI infrastructure on this list stated that their capital expenditures will be rising next year due to increased data center spend. This bodes well for Nvidia, as it receives a huge chunk of this spend. Additionally, Nvidia has reapplied for its export license to begin shipping H20 chips to China again, which will provide another growth tailwind for its business.\n\nI expect Nvidia to report blowout earnings on Aug. 27, making the stock a smart stock to scoop up before then.

Stanford is also ending its test-optional policy, requiring SAT or ACT scores for the first time since 2021.\n\nAccording to the Stanford Daily, the university is so committed to keeping legacy preferences that it’s withdrawing from California’s Cal Grant program, choosing to forgo state financial aid rather than comply with legislation signed by California governor Gavin Newsom last fall — Assembly Bill 1780 — which bans legacy admissions. The university promises to replace that funding with its own money.\n\nStanford has been the launching pad for numerous tech leaders, from the founders of Google, Nvidia, Snap, and Netflix, to many other renowned CEOs and VCs. With legacy admissions intact, children of Silicon Valley’s elite arguably maintain an advantage in accessing the network that has powered numerous tech booms.\n\nThe return of test requirements adds another wrinkle, potentially favoring students with resources for test prep. While supporters believe it maintains academic standards, critics argue that for an industry built on meritocracy rhetoric, Stanford’s decisions represent a step in the wrong direction — reinstating standardized barriers and perpetuating inequality.\n\nStanford last year announced it would reverse its 2021 decision to remove standardized testing as an application requirement. That the university will continue to consider legacy status was revealed last week in newly released admissions criteria.\n\nThe policies take on added importance given universities’ financial dependence on alumni support.

Princeton University, for example, received nearly half its donations — 46.6% — from alums in the 2022-2023 academic year.\n\nAt Stanford specifically, most donations are either directed toward annual giving via The Stanford Fund, which spends the money immediately on current operations, financial aid, and other programs, or they are provided — more often — as gifts to Stanford’s massive endowment (managed by Stanford Management Company), which spends roughly 5% annually on university operations, accounting for roughly 22% of its operating budget.\n\nUniversities depend even more heavily on alumni donations when facing external financial pressures, and new federal policies targeting higher education have created unforeseen and unprecedented budget issues for institutions like Stanford.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:00:53.914263+00:00"}

From the New York Fed’s July Survey of Consumer Expectations: \"Median inflation expectations in July increased at the one-year-ahead horizon to 3.1% from 3.0% and at the five-year-ahead horizon to 2.9% from 2.6%.

According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.63% from 6.72% last week. From Freddie Mac: \"The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to its lowest level since April.

Until we get more clarity, here’s where things stand:\n\nEarnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\n\nDemand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\n\nBut growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.\n\nActions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\n\nStocks are not the economy: There’s a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.\n\nMind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\n\nInvesting is never a smooth ride: There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\n\nThink long-term: For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.\n\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:00:57.942709+00:00"}

Discover SCENE\n\nSam Altman's OpenAI o3 model—which was deprecated late last week with the release of GPT-5—demolished Elon Musk's Grok 4 in four straight games Thursday to win Google's Kaggle Game Arena AI Chess Exhibition.\n\nYou may think it was a super complex spectacle of high tech behemoths putting their reasoning to the ultimate test, but as an appetizer, let’s say world champion Magnus Carlsen compared both bots to \"a talented kid who doesn't know how the pieces move.\"\n\nScreenshot of the AI chess tournament bracket.\n\nThe three-day tournament, which ran August 5-7, forced general-purpose chatbots—yes, the same ones that help you write email and claim to be approaching human-level intelligence—to play chess without any specialized training. No chess engines, no looking up moves, just whatever chess knowledge they'd randomly absorbed from the internet.\n\nThe results were about as elegant as you'd expect from forcing a language model to play a board game. Carlsen, who co-commentated the final, estimated both AIs were playing at the level of casual players who recently learned the rules—around 800 ELO. For context, he's arguably the best chess player who ever lived, with an ELO of 2839 points. These AIs were playing like they'd learned chess from a corrupted PDF.\n\n﻿ ﻿\n\n\"They oscillate between really, really good play and incomprehensible sequences,\" Carlsen said during a broadcast, following the game. At one point, after watching Grok walk its king directly into danger, he joked it might think they were playing King of the Hill instead of chess.\n\nThe actual games were like a masterclass in how not to play chess, even for those who don't know the game. In the first match, Grok essentially gave away one of its important pieces for free, then made things worse by trading off more pieces while already behind.\n\nGame two got even weirder. Grok tried to execute what chess players call the \"Poisoned Pawn\"—a risky but legitimate strategy where you grab an enemy pawn that looks free but isn't. Except Grok grabbed the wrong pawn entirely, one that was obviously defended. Its queen (the most powerful piece in the board) got trapped and captured immediately.\n\nBy game three, Grok had built what looked like a solid position—good positional control, no obvious dangers, and basically a set up that can help you win the match. Then in mid game, it basically fumbled the ball directly to the opponent. It lost piece after piece in rapid succession.\n\nThis was actually weird, considering that before the match against o3, Grok was a pretty strong contender, showing solid potential—so much that the chess Grand Master Hikaru Nakamura praised it. \"Grok is easily the best so far, just being objective, easily the best.\"\n\nThe fourth (and last) game provided the only genuine suspense. OpenAI's o3 made a massive blunder early in the game, which is a big danger in any reasonable match. Nakamura, who was streaming the match, said there were still \"a few tricks\" left for o3 despite the disadvantage.\n\nHe was right—o3 clawed back to win its queen back and slowly squeezed out a victory while Grok's endgame play fell apart like wet cardboard.\n\n\"Grok made so many mistakes in these games, but OpenAI did not,\" Nakamura said during his livestream. This was quite the reversal from earlier in the week.\n\nThe timing couldn't have been worse for Elon Musk. After Grok's strong early rounds, he'd posted on X that his AI's chess abilities were just a \"side effect\" and that xAI had \"spent almost no effort on chess.\" That turned out to be an understatement.\n\nThis is a side effect btw. @xAI spent almost no effort on chess. https://t.co/p18DFFn35A — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 5, 2025\n\nBefore this “official” chess tournament, International Master Levy Rozman hosted his own tournament earlier this year with less advanced models. He respected all the moves the chatbots recommended, and the whole situation ended up being a complete mess with illegal moves, piece summonings, and incorrect calculations. Stockfish, an AI built specifically for chess, ended up winning the tournament against ChatGPT. Altman’s AI was matched against Musk’s in the semifinals, and Grok lost. So it’s 2-0 for Sam.\n\nHowever, this tournament was different. Each bot got four chances to make a legal move—if they failed four times, they automatically lost. This wasn't hypothetical. In early rounds, AIs tried to teleport pieces across the board, bring dead pieces back to life, and move pawns sideways like they were playing some fever-dream version of chess they'd invented themselves.\n\nThey got disqualified.\n\nGoogle's Gemini grabbed third place by beating another OpenAI model, salvaging some dignity for the tournament organizers. That bronze medal match featured a particularly absurd drawn game where both AIs had completely winning positions at different points but couldn't figure out how to finish.\n\nCarlsen pointed out that the AIs were better at counting captured pieces than actually delivering checkmate—they understood material advantage but not how to win.

It felt so electric in the room, I asked Firefly's employees to clap us in at the top of the interview (video above).\n\nThe stock opened at $70 a share and closed the session at $60.35 — up 34% from its IPO price of $45. The company's market cap at the end of its first trading day stood at $8.48 billion.\n\nJust last week, Firefly said it had planned to sell 16.2 million shares at a range of $35 to $39. A new regulatory filing on Monday came with a much higher range of $41 to $43. The company ended up raising $868 million from the IPO after selling 19.3 million shares at $45.\n\nI think Kim's comment perfectly captures why recent IPOs have been embraced enthusiastically by investors. The early-stage companies coming to market are more mature. The businesses are more complete. The leaders are more well-rounded. (Kim told me off camera he is very ready for his first earnings call.)\n\nFirefly may still be early stage with no profits, but it's not just hot air with no substance. It's not a SPAC with a suspect leader — hearkening back to the flops from 2020. Kim is an Air Force veteran who spent considerable time working at Boeing's satellite business.\n\nHis company is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.

That's what makes it one of the best ways to increase your wealth. However, putting your money in the right stocks is crucial. Some companies may turn out to be terrible investments, as they significantly lag behind the market and may even cease to exist. Investors can avoid that fate by investing in ETFs that track major indexes or by selecting stocks that have the potential to outperform broader equities over extended periods.\n\nThese are typically well-established, highly profitable companies with solid businesses, excellent prospects, and strong competitive edges. Here are two brilliant examples: Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%), and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.37%). Here's why putting $1,000 into either of those stocks would be a great move.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has been one of the more undervalued among the trillion-dollar tech leaders of late. In fairness, that's because it faces some potential headwinds related to antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. Regulators want the company to relinquish its Chrome browser, a key component of its advertising business. While that's worth keeping an eye on, Alphabet continues to impress with its financial results. The company's second-quarter earnings were no different.\n\nThe tech giant grew its revenue by 14% year over year to $96.4 billion, while its net earnings per share (EPS) of $2.31 were up 22.2% compared to the year-ago period. Some of Alphabet's current growth drivers, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), should remain so for many years to come. The company pointed out that its cloud division, Google Cloud, now has a revenue run rate of more than $50 billion.\n\nThough Alphabet's advertising business remains its main cash cow, cloud and AI could take over in the next decade. Investors should be excited about that since it will mean that the company will become far less reliant on its advertising business, which would take the biggest hit if Alphabet loses Chrome. So, the more diversified the business becomes, the less of a risk this potential worst-case scenario of losing Chrome is.\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet is exploring other potential opportunities, including streaming through YouTube, a leader in that niche, and self-driving cars through its subsidiary, Waymo. Lastly, Alphabet has a strong competitive edge from multiple sources, including Google's network effect and strong brand name, as well as the switching costs associated with its cloud solutions. Alphabet is firing on all cylinders, and the company's long-term prospects remain bright.\n\nEven if regulators in the U.S. succeed in forcing the company to relinquish its Chrome browser, Alphabet should recover due to having multiple lucrative opportunities and significant amounts of free cash flow -- to the tune of $5.3 billion as of the end of the second quarter. That's significantly lower than the $13.5 billion it had as of the end of Q2 2024, but that's partly because Alphabet is reinvesting substantial amounts, including a projected $85 billion this year, into capital expenditures to support various growth opportunities.\n\nThis investment could pay for itself several times over in the long run as the company makes further progress in cloud, AI, and other areas. Alphabet remains well-positioned to outperform the market over the next decade. Investors can get five of the company's shares for $1,000.\n\n2. Intuitive Surgical\n\nIntuitive Surgical, the leader in the robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) market, has struggled this year. Trump's aggressive tariffs could take a bite out of the company's earnings, which is why many investors are choosing to stay away from the stock.\n\nHowever, the medical device specialist's outlook is still strong, at least for investors willing to be patient. For one, Intuitive Surgical continues to record excellent financial results. The company's second-quarter revenue was $2.44 billion, 21% higher than the year-ago period, thanks to a 17% year-over-year increase in the number of procedures performed with its crown jewel, the Da Vinci System.\n\nIntuitive Surgical's adjusted EPS came in at $2.19, 23% higher than Q2 2024. The company has had little competition in the RAS field, and although that's about to change, several factors should allow it to perform well over the next decade. First, it will be challenging for newcomers to catch up, as Intuitive Surgical has been earning indications for the Da Vinci System for years. It is approved for use in general surgeries, bariatric procedures, urologic procedures, gynecologic procedures, and more.\n\nSecond, since the Da Vinci System is expensive and requires a learning curve, after putting considerable time and money into acquiring one and training medical staff on it, healthcare facilities will need a lot of convincing to switch to a competitor. In other words, Intuitive Surgical benefits from high switching costs. Third, the company is an innovator. It earned clearance for the fifth generation of its crown jewel last year and will undoubtedly continue to improve the device.\n\nLastly, there is significant whitespace in the RAS market. Intuitive Surgical will benefit from the world's aging population, as older individuals are more likely to require many of the procedures performed with its Da Vinci system. Even with the current volume of surgeries, RAS procedures have captured only 5% of those eligible for robotic surgery. That points to a massive opportunity, and as a leader in the market, Intuitive Surgical should benefit.\n\nThe stock may be down this year, but it could deliver superior returns over the long run. With $1,000, investors can purchase two shares.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:01:12.044073+00:00"}

That hasn't stopped investor interest, as quantum computing stocks are some of the hottest on the market right now.\n\nIf you're looking to get in on the quantum computing investment trend, I've got a few solid picks that make for smart buys now and help balance out the risk that comes with investing in this space.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is the parent company of Google and many other brands. It's well known for using the resources that its Google Search engine generates to invest in various technologies and see what comes out of it. One of the more promising investment areas in quantum computing, and its breakthroughs kick-started the quantum computing investment race in December 2024.\n\nGoogle's Willow chip completed an incredibly difficult computing task rapidly, and this made investors realize that quantum computing could be coming soon. This chip performed a task in five minutes that would have taken traditional computing 10 septillion years (10 to the 25th power), showcasing its impressive capabilities.\n\nAlphabet is heavily investing in quantum computing because it can bolster its AI goals. Additionally, with its massive cloud computing business, offering a quantum computing solution of its own eliminates the need for intermediaries (like how it needs Nvidia GPUs now), allowing this segment to become far more profitable.\n\nWith Alphabet, it doesn't need quantum computing to be a successful investment, but if it succeeds, it will be a great boost to Alphabet's existing business.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT 1.44%) is in almost the same boat as Alphabet. It's developing a quantum computing capability in-house in an attempt to cut out the middleman to make more profits.\n\nMicrosoft has done extensive work in this field, and even claims to have created a new state of matter for its Majorana 1 chip. Microsoft has a ton of spare cash to invest in this technology, so it should be seen as a huge threat in the quantum computing space.\n\nAdditionally, CEO Satya Nadella is a believer in the technology, and he believes that the next big accelerator in its cloud computing business will be quantum-related. With Microsoft working on widespread quantum computing availability, it looks like a solid stock to buy in the quantum realm.\n\nIonQ\n\nWhile Alphabet and Microsoft are both viable competitors in the quantum computing realm, their upside is limited because they have ancillary businesses that may overshadow the benefits of a booming quantum computing business.\n\nThat's why pure plays such as IonQ (IONQ -4.36%) are popular too, as their stocks stand to skyrocket if they're successful. IonQ is my top pure-play quantum computing pick because of the approach that it's taking.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, and many other competitors are taking a superconducting approach, which requires cooling a particle to near absolute zero. IonQ's trapped ion approach can be done at room temperature, which makes it far more cost-effective. IonQ estimates that it costs less than $50 million for its machines versus $1 billion for superconducting computers.\n\nThat's a huge difference, and having an easily scalable and low-cost quantum computing platform is key to success for emerging technologies. Ultimately, IonQ may not be a winner, as there could be an unknown hurdle it cannot clear while developing its product. As a result, investors should keep position sizing for IonQ relatively small, so that if it goes to $0, it doesn't have a huge effect on a portfolio. But if it succeeds, it can provide portfolio-changing returns.\n\nQuantum computing could be the next biggest technology. By having some exposure to this trio, investors can benefit from a massive long-term trend that could define the next decade of investing.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:01:15.447095+00:00"}

Also in the mix, however, are several members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nIn late July, Ark added to an existing position in Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) -- scooping up 181,640 shares in the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF.\n\nLet's explore how Alphabet is investing in AI to transform its business. From there, I'll break down some financial and valuation trends to help illustrate why Alphabet stock looks like a no-brainer right now.\n\nAlphabet's business is in great shape\n\nAlphabet recently reported operating results for its second quarter, which ended June 30.\n\nThe company's largest source of revenue -- advertising -- generated $71.3 billion in revenue, growing by 10% year over year. Advertising growth from Google Search and YouTube was even more robust, coming in at 12% and 13%, respectively.\n\nOver the last few years, skeptics on Wall Street have been parroting a bearish narrative that the rise of ChatGPT and other competing large language models (LLMs) will diminish Google's dominance in search. Accelerating growth between Google Search and YouTube suggests that advertisers still see a high return on investment (ROI) from these platforms, despite some shifts in how people are consuming content on the internet.\n\nWhere investors may be getting nitpicky is around Alphabet's profit margin profile. The advertising segment sits under a larger category of Alphabet's business, called Google Services. During the second quarter, Google Services grew its revenue 12% year over year to $82.5 billion. However, the operating margin for the Services business remained flat year over year -- coming in at 40%.\n\nWhen expenses grow in line with revenue, profit margins become capped. On the surface, this may look like Alphabet is not running an efficient business despite an accelerating top line. I wouldn't rush to such a conclusion, though.\n\nOver the last few years, Alphabet has made a number of strategic investments to bolster its AI position. For starters, the company augmented its cloud infrastructure business by acquiring cybersecurity start-up, Wiz, for a reported $32 billion.\n\nOn top of that, Alphabet's multibillion-dollar investments in AI data centers are often underappreciated -- and yet it's this infrastructure that attracted OpenAI, a perceived rival, as one of Google Cloud's new major partners.\n\nLastly, Alphabet is also quietly building its own quantum computing operation through the development of its own custom chipsets, called Willow. Although monetizing quantum computing applications is still likely many years away, I find it encouraging that Alphabet is allocating capital across several pockets of the AI realm in an effort to build a diversified ecosystem that strengthens core businesses while opening the door to new opportunities as well.\n\nIs Alphabet stock a buy right now?\n\nThe chart below benchmarks Alphabet against many of its big tech peers on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis. Ultimately, I think Alphabet stock is being punished by investors because the company isn't posting growth as robust as some of its peers.\n\nIn my eyes, the fact that the company continues to grow revenue from its core businesses while striking lucrative deals with rivals and maintaining its profit margin profile in the face of aggressive investments shows a high degree of resiliency from Alphabet. Given the disparity in valuation multiples illustrated above, I think that the bearish narrative appears to be fully baked into Alphabet stock at this point.\n\nTo me, Alphabet is positioned for significant valuation expansion in the coming years as its infrastructure investments continue to bear fruit. I think Wood identified a rare opportunity among major AI players by identifying such a cheap stock floating around in a sea of frothy valuations. I see Alphabet stock as a no-brainer buying opportunity at its current price point for long-term investors.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:01:25.077115+00:00"}

The company’s most advanced AI model yet, and available now at ChatGPT.com, OpenAI says GPT-5 is a step up from its prior GPT models across a number of areas, including writing, coding, health knowledge, and more.\n\nAccording to CEO Sam Altman, GPT-5 is like speaking to a \"legitimate PhD-level expert.” It’s also, the company says, less prone to hallucinations than previous releases.\n\nThe biggest change you’ll notice when using GPT-5 is that it is the only model you can use. You’ll no longer be able to use GPT-4o or any other GPT version. But OpenAI says you shouldn’t be too concerned about that.\n\nThat’s because GPT-5 can automatically switch between providing quick, efficient answers to queries and taking time to reason longer over more complex questions, depending on how you ask them. It’s a helpful feature, to be sure, since you don’t have to take the time to decide whether you’re using the right model for your particular ask.\n\nIf you’re a Plus or Team user, you also have the option of selecting GPT-5 Thinking as your base model. But free users are out of luck. When you run through your usage limit, ChatGPT will automatically switch to smaller, less resource-intensive GPT-5 models.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, GPT-5 offers enhanced writing skills that include more literary depth and rhythm. It can also help you translate information from things like complex medical reports into plain English, making them far easier to understand. Of course, the model isn’t bulletproof, so you’ll want to double-check any medical information and run it by your doctor before making any decisions.\n\nThe ChatGPT 5 logo is displayed on a mobile phone.

(Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) · NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nGPT-5 is also more adept at coding than earlier GPT models. It can put together things like basic games and apps with just a few prompts and details. And unlike previous versions of GPT, GPT-5 gives your apps a bit of stylistic flair, rather than making them feel dull and flat.\n\nThat should prove helpful for the types of folks who are interested in “vibe coding,” or writing software using natural language prompts rather than actual code.\n\nGPT-5 is also more personal thanks to its ability to connect to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Calendar, Gmail, and Contacts. In one demo, OpenAI showed how GPT-5 can help pull together a schedule based on your calendar and travel information from your email. It’s the kind of helpfulness that is certain to attract some users, while turning off others who prefer to keep their more sensitive data private and away from third-party apps.\n\nImportantly, OpenAI says GPT-5 is less sycophantic than its predecessors. The company originally released an update to GPT-4o in April but quickly pulled it back after the chatbot began being overly flattering to users. It also, the company said, was validating users’ doubts, fueling anger, and urging impulsive actions.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:01:27.007043+00:00"}

Startups from OpenAI to Anthropic have raised tens of billions of dollars.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBut there’s a downside to the new technology that investors are increasingly taking note of: It threatens to upend industries much like the internet did before it. And investors have started placing bets on just where that disruption will occur next, ditching shares in companies some strategists expect will see falloffs in demand as AI applications become more widely adopted.\n\nAmong them are web-development firms like Wix.com Ltd., digital-image company Shutterstock Inc. and software maker Adobe Inc. The trio are part of a basket of 26 companies Bank of America strategists identified as most at risk from AI. The group has underperformed the S&P 500 Index by about 22 percentage points since mid-May after more or less keeping pace with the market since ChatGPT’s debut in late 2022.\n\n“The disruption is real,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the Futurum Group. “We thought it would happen over five years. It seems like it is going to happen over two. Service-based businesses with a high headcount, those are going to be really vulnerable, even if they have robust businesses from the last era of tech.”\n\nSo far, few companies have failed as a result of the proliferation of chatbots and so-called agents that can write software code, answer complex questions and produce photos and videos. But with tech giants like Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. pouring hundreds of billions into AI, investors have started to get more defensive.\n\nWix.com and Shutterstock are down at least 33% in 2025, compared with a 8.6% advance for the broad benchmark. Adobe has fallen 23% amid concerns clients will look to AI platforms that can generate images and videos, as Coca-Cola has already done with an AI-generated ad. ManpowerGroup Inc., whose staffing services could be hurt by rising automation, is down 30% this year, while peer Robert Half Inc. has shed more than half its value, dropping to its lowest in more than five years.\n\nThe souring sentiment among investors comes as AI is changing everything from the way people get information from the internet to how colleges function. Even companies at the vanguard of the technology’s development like Microsoft have been slashing jobs as productivity improves and to make way for more AI investments. To many tech-industry watchers, the time is nearing when AI becomes so pervasive that companies start going out of business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:01:28.936393+00:00"}

These companies are delivering impressive growth combined with reasonable prices, making them great stocks to buy now.\n\nIf you've got $50,000 ready to invest (or really any dollar amount, for that matter), taking a look at this cohort is a smart idea.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is one of the best values in the market right now. It is delivering consistent and strong growth, with revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rising 14% and 22% in the second quarter, respectively.\n\nNormally, that would cause a company like Alphabet to trade at a premium to the market, but that's not the case.\n\nAlphabet trades at 19.7 times forward earnings, and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) trades for 23.8 times forward earnings. That's a significant discount to the broader market, and makes Alphabet an excellent stock to buy now before the market bids the stock up.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (META 3.16%) delivered a knockout earnings report in Q2. Its revenue was up 22% year over year, despite it only guiding for 13% growth. It expects that strength to continue throughout Q3, with revenue growth expected to be about 20%.\n\nWhile Meta is investing heavily in building out its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, its existing advertising business is thriving. Some of Meta's AI investments are starting to pay off, with AI ad creation becoming more popular and various AI initiatives driving increased interaction and conversion rates on its platforms.\n\nMeta is more pricey than Alphabet at 27.6 times forward earnings, although it has earned that premium with its rapid growth. Meta is growing significantly faster than the market's long-term average (about 10%). It's not that much more expensive, which makes today's price reasonable.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nThe AI race wouldn't be possible without cutting-edge chip technology from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%). Taiwan Semiconductor is a chip foundry and produces chips for big-time clients like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nEssentially, if a company doesn't have chip production capabilities, it needs to find a supplier for its chip production. Taiwan Semiconductor has risen to become the top option in this field, and has the growth to show for it. In Q2, TSMC's revenue rose by 44% year over year in U.S. dollars. Despite its strong growth rate, Taiwan Semiconductor doesn't have a massive valuation like one may expect.\n\nAt 23.8 times forward earnings, it's priced nearly identically to the broader market.\n\nWith Taiwan Semiconductor growing at a rapid pace and expected to continue its strong growth for some time, combined with a reasonable price tag, it's an excellent stock to buy now.\n\nAmazon\n\nAt first glance, Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) looks a bit pricey for its growth and valuation. In Q2, Amazon's revenue increased by 13%, yet it's the most expensive stock on this list at 32.5 times forward earnings.\n\nHowever, this is the wrong way to look at Amazon's stock. Amazon is an earnings growth story, not a revenue growth story.\n\nAmazon's operating income has been growing at a far faster pace than revenue over the past few quarters. This rise is due to multiple factors, including increased efficiency. But the biggest driver has been from the rise of two segments: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising. Both of these are much higher-margin businesses than the base commerce business Amazon is known for. Additionally, each is growing rapidly, with AWS' revenue rising 17% and advertising service revenue rising 23% in Q2.\n\nThis is a long-term trend that will continue for many years, and a patient investor will be well rewarded for sticking with Amazon's stock over the next few years. With the stock reacting negatively following Q2 results, now seems like an excellent time to scoop up shares.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:01:35.328141+00:00"}

There are official distinctions, like S&P 500 components versus those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but there are also more nuanced groupings, like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, etc.\n\nSometimes, investors will get a little whimsical and come up with catchy names to describe red-hot, winning stocks. The \"Nifty Fifty\" was a popular term for large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nJim Cramer used \"FANG\" to describe Facebook (now Meta Platforms (META 3.16%)), Amazon (AMZN 0.08%), Netflix (NFLX 0.55%), and Google (now Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%)). It eventually expanded to \"FAANG\" to include Apple (AAPL 1.13%).\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the largest seven technology-focused companies: Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (TSLA 0.54%).\n\nBut the Magnificent Seven has its problems, which is why I'm introducing the \"Ten Titans\" -- the Magnificent Seven plus Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), Oracle (ORCL 0.27%), and Netflix.\n\nHere's why the Ten Titans is a better representation of top growth stocks than the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe Broadcom blunder\n\nThe biggest flaw of the Magnificent Seven is that it doesn't include Broadcom. It's up about 450% in the last three years, which has pole-vaulted its market cap well over $1 trillion.\n\nBased on market cap, it deserves to be included in the Magnificent Seven over Tesla. However, some folks may prefer the diversification that Tesla brings to the table with electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). And some may argue that it's redundant to include both Nvidia and Broadcom since they're both chip giants, but Broadcom has a much different business than Nvidia.\n\nNvidia generates the vast majority of its profits by selling graphics processing units and associated hardware and software to data centers. Like Nvidia, Broadcom makes AI chips, and AI is its fastest-growing segment, making up around 30% of total revenue in its latest quarter. But the bulk of Broadcom's business is not directly tied to AI.\n\nEnd markets include networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, infrastructure software, and more. In fact, Broadcom was considered a dividend-paying value stock before its recent boom -- similar to another high-yield semiconductor stalwart, Texas Instruments.\n\nAnother \"value\" stock turned growth stock\n\nNot long ago, Oracle was seen more as a mature tech stock with an entrenched legacy business and limited upside potential. Investors were more excited about hotter software stocks like Salesforce, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Palo Alto Networks. However, Oracle has completely transformed its business, integrating cloud infrastructure as a complement to its foothold in database software and enterprise applications.\n\nOracle has carved out a growing role in the cloud that is uniquely different from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle's hybrid and multicloud strategy integrates with the major cloud players, which allows customers to use Oracle's database advantages even if they're with another cloud provider.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers some advantages over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, including lower prices in some cases, more AI tools, and vertical integration with the company's other database services.\n\nSome drawbacks of OCI are that it has a smaller ecosystem with fewer preset tools for developers. However, Oracle is growing faster than the major players with a 27% year-over-year cloud revenue increase in its most recent quarter, including a 52% rise in cloud infrastructure revenue.\n\nLike Broadcom, Oracle is a great addition to the Ten Titans because it's a highly diversified company that's playing a growing role in AI.\n\nFAANG's anchor is a worthy addition to the Ten Titans\n\nNetflix was an integral part of FANG and FAANG, but it fell out of favor for a while as it underperformed the broad market. The streaming company is now worth around half a trillion dollars, which has catapulted it to the top 20 S&P 500 companies by market cap.\n\nNetflix has pulled back from its recent highs, but the stock has still crushed the S&P 500 year to date. A big reason for its rebound in recent years is its improved cost management and more purposeful spending.\n\nA major problem with the business in the past was the boom-and-bust nature of its earnings. The company would steadily grow subscribers, but it would overspend on content and have dry spells without major success.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix spent most of the 2010s being inconsistently profitable. But over the last five years, profits have skyrocketed and its operating margin continues to climb in lockstep with revenue.\n\nThe company has revolutionized entertainment and remains the gold standard in streaming, despite tons of new competition. A lot of that success comes down to its ability to balance the quantity and quality of content it produces.\n\nIt's time to add some all-stars to the team\n\nExpanding the Magnificent Seven to the Ten Titans corrects for the blatant error of Broadcom's omission and includes massively important growth stocks in Oracle and Netflix. Over the next three to five years, it wouldn't be surprising if all of the Titans were worth over $1 trillion due to their industry leadership and runways for growth.\n\nWith a combined weighting of 37.7% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans offer investors a useful way to track the top growth stocks that can really move the major indexes and keep tabs on prevailing themes that are driving the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:01:38.365677+00:00"}

With shares tripling, I was already doing the math in my head, thinking \"If I got filled on all 1,000 shares, I'm up over $80,000!\"\n\nExcept I hadn't yet read the second email from Robinhood.\n\nWhen I finally opened it, I saw this: \"Your request to buy 1,000 shares of FIG was partially filled. You received 1 share at $33.\"\n\nOne. Out of 1,000.\n\nSee Also: Accredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM—Secure $0.63 Shares Before 8/14\n\nSo, what happened? Robinhood uses a random allocation process – essentially a lottery. It doesn't matter how many shares you request or how big your account is. It uses a fair system. But sometimes, fairness can sting.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:01:40.202717+00:00"}

Apple has also opened a manufacturing academy in Detroit, administered by Michigan State University, to train U.S. workers in AI and smart manufacturing.\n\nMagnifying Apple's appeasement and political diplomacy, Tim Cook presented a custom-made glass sculpture engraved with President Trump’s name and mounted on a 24-karat gold base. Most importantly to investors, the gesture was symbolic and strategic, as it coincided with Trump’s announcement that Apple would be exempt from the 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors.\n\nAAPL is Gaining Momentum\n\nAttributed to the tariff exemptions, Apple stock has now spiked +10% in August, with these month-to-date gains leading its “Magnificent Seven” big tech peers.\n\nHowever, AAPL is still toward the bottom of the group for the year, down 9% to only top Tesla’s TSLA -18%, with Nvidia NVDA up more than +30% and leading the pack.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAAPL Valuation Comparison\n\nIn terms of valuation, Apple currently checks in with the third cheapest P/E ratio among the Mag 7 at 30.5X forward earnings, only trailing Alphabet’s GOOGL 19.7X and Meta Platforms META 27.2X.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple also has the third-lowest P/S ratio among these big tech peers at 8.1X forward sales, trailing Amazon’s AMZN 3.3X and Alphabet’s 6.4X.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:01:42.153135+00:00"}

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Matt Frankel. I'm joined by my fellow longtime analyst Jon Quast, as well as the Motley Fools co founder and CEO Tom Gardner. Later in the show, we're going to be joined by fool.com analyst Jonathan Wilder. Today we're going to look at some recent earnings from Tesla, Chipotle, Alphabet, service now in IBM, and a little bit later, we are going to look at the Figma IPO that is coming up real soon. First, we're going to put Tesla's results under the microscope. It wasn't a big surprise, but Tesla reported a really weak second quarter. Automotive revenue was down 16% every year. The company has been losing EV market share to traditional automakers like GM. Some will say that Tesla's long term thesis is about a whole lot more than vehicle sales. Jon, what are your thoughts on this?\n\nJon Quast: Look Matt, I think if you're buying Tesla's stock today, you're not buying for the next year, you are looking for the next decade. Look, the report, it's shocking to see its primary revenue generator. Cars have a 16% drop. For any other company, this would be all out panic, but a lot of people say this is just vehicle sales for Tesla. First and foremost of those would be CEO Elon Musk. He says, on the earning call, everything with this business comes down to one word and that's autonomy. The idea is this company will make far more money in the future with its self driving software, with its robot taxis, with its optimist robot. All that is autonomy and that's really the thesis that Tesla Bowles and the CEO Elon Musk have for the company.\n\nMatt Frankel: Direct question here. Do you think Tesla's a buy right now?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah. As you're looking at it, if you're thinking through this grid of autonomy, if you're thinking through the grid of cars, then there's trouble right now. If you're thinking through the grid of autonomy, you really just have to extend that viewpoint way out because this isn't going to happen right away. Musk said that he's eyeing robot taxis for half the US population by the end of this year. But keywords there include probably and pending approval. Spoiler alert I'm almost positive there won't be that much regulatory approval by the end of the year. When it comes to optimist robot, look, they're trying to scale that up, but they're still working on the prototype Number 3 this year and hoping to get that done before the end of the year. I think that you're looking not at 2025 when it comes to Tesla, you need to be thinking 2035 if you're buying into this concept of autonomy today.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, I'd like to get your opinion on this. One of the key quotes that stood out to me from the earnings release was from Elon Musk. He said, we could probably have a few rough quarters, specifically referencing tariffs and the EB tax credits expiring. There's a lot at play here. How do you see the next year or so playing out for Tesla?\n\nTom Gardner: Well, I think it's going to be a bad year by any normal standard for a great growth company. This is not going to be a good year, but Elon Musk and Tesla. Tesla is a lot more than Elon Musk. I'm not meaning to diminish the huge impact he has on the business, but this is a massive company now and we have to understand that the really great companies aren't thinking about the next year. Jeff Bezos talked about this all the time at Amazon. Sometimes as analysts, we get really focused on what does this quarter look like? What's happening with the next 12 months for this business? But great business leaders are really looking forward much farther than that, we have to remember that in the backdrop for Tesla, they have $30 billion cash in net cash on their balance sheet. They have so much more capital, such a stronger balance sheet than anyone in automobiles. Musk's bet here, Tesla's bet is that we are moving to autonomy. It might take longer, there might be some issues in regulatory process on autonomous driving, but robot taxis are live and awesome. We see it with Waymo. We see a lot of high customer satisfaction, willingness to pay more. Obviously, there's not tipping going on, so you can pay a little extra, but it's going to be a premium feature. The last thing I'll say in my belief that Tesla will beat the market over the next five years.\n\nI do actually agree and have for a long time with what Musk said on the earnings call which is that he thinks Tesla will be the largest company in the world if autonomy plays out. I don't think that there's much question as whether it's going to play out. We'll see whether he's right about what will happen with Tesla. But remember, in the backdrop the idea is to have a million optimist robots in less than five years. There is, as Jon says, a lot that you're holding onto in belief. Let's see if this really plays out. I will say in hidden gems we've been an island because we're the only thing in the Motley Fool recommending the stock since 2012 with over 60 recommendations. The first one at about $2 a share. It's played out very well for us, but you cannot own the stock if a 30-50% decline in the price of the shares is going to knock you out because there's just no way you're going to avoid that. This stock will be down 40-60% multiple times. Every two or three years, you should expect a 30-40% decline in stock, in my opinion, and those have been and I believe will continue to be great opportunities to add.\n\nMatt Frankel: Let's pivot to Chipotle's earnings real quick. Unlike Tesla, investors are not that excited about what happened. They gave investors a not so pleasant surprise. They lowered their same store sales guidance for the year, same store traffic declined by 5% year over year. Tom, I know you follow Chipotle pretty closely as well. Is the week's second quarter something investors should really be worried about?\n\nTom Gardner: Not the quarter in itself, Matt, as we discussed with long term thinking for a business like Tesla. However, I'm on the record and my conviction is that, for example, Starbucks will be a better stock over the next five years than Chipotle. Part of that is just straight up Brian Nichol, the CEO who left Chipotle and is now at Starbucks. Is Brian Nichol closer to Michael Jordan, hoops fans know that Chicago Bulls won six NBA championships in eight years. Then when Jordan left in 1998 they have never been back into the championship series again. Sometimes you have an extraordinary leader and I think that is the case with Brian Nichol. My fear for Chipotle is that they're going to lose premium positioning now. We see flattening out same store sales growth. Restaurant margins in decline and obviously in this economic environment, which I think will persist because of a lot of the changes in the technology landscape and what will happen with employment, consumers are looking for discounts and getting lower priced protein in the form of chicken. Chipotle has has a billion and a half in cash flow. This is not a company in trouble at all. My fear is that it will become more of an operating company now rather than a vision driven business. That makes me think that this will be at best a market performer here over the next five years. As I said, I think Starbucks will outperform Chipotle with Brian Nichol as Starbucks a CEO.\n\nMatt Frankel: It's really important to put the quarter into context. Jon, just to name a few things. We got the initial tariff announcements at the start of the second quarter, stocks briefly plunged into a bear market. Consumers started becoming really cautious about discretionary spending, especially when that was going on. What are your thoughts on Chipotle as we head into the second half of the year?\n\nJon Quast: Look Matt, this is anecdotal, but I don't know personally, a single person who saw a tariff announcement on the news and said, Honey, maybe we should skip our Chipotle order this week. I would say that Chipotle is getting more pushback from other things. As Tom mentioned a minute ago, perhaps there's even a perception on value and portion sizes. This did actually come up last year with the company and they had to address it head on. It takes time to change a consumer perception of the business, whether it's real or it's just perceived, it takes time. I think we're still seeing that play out with the traffic being down, they didn't take any pricing. They've been taking pricing in recent years and getting to this point where I think consumers are reaching their limit. That is playing against them right now. I think that is what's happening rather than tariffs being something that are influencing consumers.\n\nLook I think that long term, I also agree with Tom that I think this is a company that is still fantastic operationally. Even with a rough quarter, you're looking at 18% operating profit margins. I know restaurants that would be happy with half of that. Long term, I think this still a company with a lot of promise, it's going to add many new restaurants in coming years. It's going to generate a lot of cash flow. I would agree though, is this going to become more of an operating thing? I'm not really sure that the unit economics are going to recover fully this year. It's going to take time to win back some consumers that have been lost.\n\nMatt Frankel: Next up, we're going to take a look at Alphabet's quarter, and it was a strong one. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nMALE_1: Does it ever feel like you're a marketing professional just speaking into the void? Well, with LinkedIn ads, you can know you're reaching the right decision makers. You can even target them by job title, industry, company, role, seniority, skills, company revenue, and do I say job title yet? Get started today and see how you can avoid the void and reach the right buyers with LinkedIn ads. To get 100 pounds off your first campaign, go to linkedin.com/lead to claim your credit. Terms and conditions apply.\n\nMatt Frankel: Another one that just reported. Alphabet just reported really impressive results throughout its business. This is the Google parent company, of course. Google Cloud revenue was an extremely strong point with 32% revenue growth. That was an acceleration in the second quarter. Really, one of the biggest takeaways that I got from the report is that the AI investments they're making seem to be working, and management now expects to spend $85 billion in CapEx this year, primarily on building data centers and AI infrastructure up from the previous estimate of 75 billion. I'd love to get the thoughts from both of you but Jon, we'll start with you. What are your thoughts on the quarter and this aggressive AI investment strategy?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah, we human beings are so bad when it comes to big numbers like this. You said it just so casually and so many people are. But let's stop for a second. They raised their capital expenditure guidance by $10 billion. With this money you could buy Campbell Soup Company, 150-year-old business with products in every store across the United States. They could buy Huntington Engles. This is one of the only companies capable of building a nuclear powered aircraft carrier. That's just the amount that they raised the guidance by 10 billion. If you're talking 85 billion now, that's bigger than the GDP of Croatia, Sri Lanka, Panama. That is what they're spending this year on capital expenditures, and that's just one company in one year. This AI trend is unbelievable. When you look at the spending ratcheting up like that, I get really excited thinking about who is on the receiving end of those dollars. There's going to be spending on the GPUs. There's going to be spending on data centers. Power needs are going to be going up. There are so many ways that this can trickle throughout the economy that gets me really excited.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, all this AI spending could be worth it if they're getting a return and it looks like so far they are. What are your thoughts on just this general trend toward billions and billions of dollars being pumped into the AI infrastructure right now?\n\nTom Gardner: Yeah, the first thing is that the reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated. They've been making transitions in their search with Gemini. I'll talk about that in a second, but the business is fundamentally on very solid footing and now they are succeeding and utilizing that AI in profitable ways and breakthrough ways in their overall ecosystem. Google is a Cloud and AI story, and companies that aren't in the Cloud today and aren't accelerating AI every single day are going to be in deep, deep trouble and it's going to come a lot faster than people think. On the Cloud front, Google Cloud is taking market share now from AWS. Their revenue run rate for Google Cloud is $50 billion. Their operating margins raised up to 20% this quarter. Google Cloud is vibrant and a force for the company. On the AI front, Google's scaling Gemini across all those search. Search is essentially becoming a private label brand for Google now, like Kirkland at Costco or 365 at Whole Foods. The private label brand search, 60% of all searches are being resolved without any user click. Think about that. The Gemini feature where you're getting that AI expression when you search something on a mobile screen takes up 75% of screen space. Google is all in on Cloud and AI, and one of the ironies I see with that $85 billion CapEx and one of the things I see about that increase of 10 billion, as Jon said, up to $85 billion in CapEx is also a company that will be working people out of jobs at Google. What that is telling us is that this automation is real. It is significant. People who are investing in AI companies, but not using AI in their everyday life and at their companies are going to fall so far behind so quickly now.\n\nGoogle is just one of the many large technology companies that are demonstrating. This is real. This is enormous. We're betting our entire company to make sure that we're in leadership position in our category. For Google shareholders, thank heavens for that because if Google had fallen behind further, it would be harder and harder for them to catch up both on the Cloudfront and in terms of AI applications. The one caution I have for Google shareholders is just anti competitive practices and whether the regulators are going to get involved with that Gemini search now. Because Gemini search is saving them. They may be a decline in search coming to the Google platform because you can get so much right off Chat GPT or Cloud, Grok, etc, perplexity. But that Gemini application is bringing more and more revenue into search for Google. They're actually on solid footing with their search and the business is on solid footing and if they don't run into regulators, I think you've got a double digit market outperformer in Google from here.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, speaking of AI investment, service now I know that's a company you follow. They just posted a really strong second quarter. That was in my opinion, the strongest earnings report as far as the surprise of all the ones we're talking about. I believe their CEO would agree with you. Bill McDermott said in the earnings release, every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI. Even after today's upward move, the stock's still down in 2025. For one, I'm pretty sure you agree with their CEO, but two, what do you make of their future growth prospects now?\n\nTom Gardner: Well, I think the growth prospects are bright for service now. They have excellent underlying financials. You see 30% operating margins just about just short of that, 98% renewal rates among their customers. This is a fantastic business being run quite successfully. I do agree, as you mentioned and mentioned from Bill McDermott, that AI is the new UI that all future product development is coming through AI, fundamentally, all B to C experiences, all consumer experiences and dig will be on AI applications. The one question I have as a service now shareholder ourselves at the Motley Fool is the company has a $200 billion market cap. I think it can outperform the market, but we see those great earnings leading to a marginal increase in the stock today and that's partially just because it's such a richly valued company. A lot of element areas of the market are richly priced right now. I just be patient. Every time you get a chance to buy service now when it's down 10 or 15%, I take advantage of that, and I think you'll be rewarded with profitable investments.\n\nMatt Frankel: Next up, we're going to take a look at IBM's earnings real quick and Figma's upcoming IPO. I'm excited to talk about that.\n\nMALE_1: LD super six fruit and veg comes with a freshness guarantee from just 29 peach red grape fruit, spring onions, pinkeds, apples, and mixed peppers, plus British Jersey roll potatoes and cherries, and the cherry on top. Amazing LD value in store now. LD which cheapest supermarket 2024. Products and prices may vary subject to availability.\n\nMatt Frankel: Jon, IBM shares are down after earnings despite beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The key reason seems to be that the management team is really cautious right now. The CEO said some clients are being cautious due to trade tensions, US federal spending is down, and there are a few other reasons. What are your thoughts on IBM's quarter and is the stock a buy right now?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah, I was surprised that the stock was down after looking over the numbers. Most of the metrics were up and above expectations. Of course, we should keep in mind that with the drop it's still outperforming the S&P 500 over the last year and year to date so context matters I think. But look when it comes to IBM, I think it's really easy to dismiss it from the artificial intelligence conversation because it's such an old business. It doesn't scream AI to me, but all these businesses out there right now are trying to figure out how do use AI in our company and many of them don't know how to do that. That means that they need consulting. It turns out that IBM is pretty good at this. CEO Arvin Krishna said it's book of business for generative AI is now at 7.5 billion and accelerating. Essentially, companies are coming to IBM and looking to how do we integrate AI into what we're doing. That means that they're really actually pretty well positioned and probably better positioned than a lot of investors give them credit for.\n\nNow, granted, IBM only expects about 5% revenue growth this year. Usually when I'm looking at a tech stock to buy, I want to see a little bit better growth in this. That said, over the last couple of years I've just had this growing conviction that IBM is better positioned than people give them credit for. For me, it is a stock to watch.\n\nMatt Frankel: Well, maybe Warren Buffet shouldn't have sold it when he did. Now let's get to the story that I've been really looking forward to. We're going to talk about Figma's IPO. Jonathan, I want to bring you in on this. We're starting to see a resurgence in IPO activity and one big, highly anticipated IPO that's about to go public is Figma. Before we dive in, can you just give us a 32nd description of what Figma does?\n\nJonathan Wilder: Figma is essentially a Google Docs, essentially for UIUX, it allows collaboration between multiple designers to create rapid prototypes which can then be put into the prototype present feedback and iterate loop, which most corporations use to develop new products. That's essentially what they do.\n\nMatt Frankel: Talking to you before the show, I think it would be fair to say, maybe this is an understatement that you're not entirely bullish on the growth story here. Can you tell us why you're approaching Figma with so much caution?\n\nJonathan Wilder: First came out in 2012. They are very much, in my view attached to a an older way of developing products, which again, going back to that is very much the prototype present feedback and iterate. That process can take days, weeks or even months in a typical corporation. With generative AI, that can go down to literally 30 minutes. Instead of getting one prototype back from a design team, you're getting 5-10 prototypes back in less than a day. That alone is a huge disruption for Figma. It's a huge disruption for Adobe and any companies in this space. That's my major. Actually, one example is Galileo is a generative AI competitor to Figma. They were just purchased by Google about a month and a half ago, renamed Stitch and made available completely for free. If you're taking a look at a $75 seat license for FIGMA, you now have an option just to use Google Stitch for free. If I come from a start-up background, and if I raised $5 million at a $20 million valuation, I have the option, should I hire a FIGMA expert for 140 or $150,000 a year or should I just hire AI bots in the form of Stitch, Galileo, and some other versions of AI versions of a Figma and save myself a huge amount of money. I think currently, large corporations are the ones that are stuck on Figma. However as a good example is the Parsons School of Design in New York City are actively now beginning to teach generative AI design. The new designers that are coming out, the younger designers that are entering the workforce, the first tools that they're going toward are generative AI tools. They do not go to Figma. They do not go to Photoshop, even at this point. That's my main thesis, where I'm not too bullish on it.\n\nJon Quast: Jonathan, I think a lot of investors would be reading over the S1 when it comes to Figma and looking at that 46% year over year revenue growth. I think there's a sense that the generative AI trend is already mature. How do we take what you've just shared about the business and maybe some of the risks. But then also how do we counterbalance that with the 46% revenue growth that we see?\n\nJonathan Wilder: Generative AI really started in 2018, 2019 with the transformer architecture. That was first released for the public with Chat GPT in late 2022. However, the generative AI scope of what it's covering it first started to attack coding, the models are continuously being evolved. It then started doing things with the Chat GPT of image generation, runway with video generation, and this area of rapid prototyping is something that is not necessarily a focus of generative AI because if you use something like a cursor or a wind surf you can actually bypass Figma completely because as you're building a design using one of those tools or a bolt is you can ask with very specific prompts to build the design. It will also build the code at the background and will also deploy the code and the design live to a hosting environment. You're talking about Google earlier, Google's doing a very good job of integrating all of these types of tools, and that's why they purchased Stitch, where once you create a design on Stitch, which you would have done previously in FIGMA, now it's already creating the code.\n\nWith one click, it's in Google Colab, which is their development environment and another click, it's in Google Cloud. FIGMA does not have any of that type of functionality built in. The pace of how that's going to evolve is, I would say, exponential over the next year. Most of what Figma has put on in terms of generative AI, I see mostly as band aids, marketing hype. It's unclear what they'll do over the next year. They can turn it around and put really useful generative AI tools within their interface which hasn't changed a huge amount, really in the past decade. Those [MUSIC] are my major concerns.\n\nMatt Frankel: Thanks Jonathan, for that clarity on Figma. It will be really interesting to watch once that one goes public next week.

Currently gaining traction among younger users, these clips feature wild characters, like a shark wearing sneakers and a ballerina with a cappuccino for a head.\n\nOne startup driving this trend is OpenArt, founded by two former Google employees in 2022. It touts around 6 million monthly active users.\n\nThe company recently launched a new “one-click story” feature in open beta, which allows users to input a single sentence, a script, or even a song and turn it into a one-minute video with a story arc. This can include anything from a light-hearted story for TikTok to more serious content like explainer videos or music videos for YouTube. OpenArt even envisions this feature being used for advertising.\n\nWith One-Click Story, there are three templates to choose from: Character Vlog, Music Video, or Explainer. For a character vlog, users start by uploading an image of their character and entering a prompt. If a song is uploaded, the software understands the lyrics and creates an animation that aligns with the song’s themes, like illustrating flowers blooming in a garden.\n\nUsers can edit individual clips by revisiting the editor’s storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for a more refined result. The platform aggregates over 50 AI models, allowing users to choose their preferred tools, such as DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion.\n\nImage Credits:OpenArt\n\nThe goal of the new feature is to further lower the barrier for becoming an AI creator, a medium that remains immensely popular despite ongoing controversy.\n\nWhile these tools can be beneficial — like using video generators to quickly produce content with original characters and narratives — there are numerous ethical issues to address. These include imitating other artists’ styles, intellectual property rights, and the dangers of misuse and creating misinformation.\n\nDuring testing, we noticed that the Character Vlog option may tread into a grey legal area due to the types of characters it offers — such as Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario — which could pose risks of intellectual property (IP) infringement. In June, Disney and Universal sued AI firm Midjourney over AI-generated images.\n\nUsers should be aware that if their videos are found to infringe another’s copyright, the video may be taken off social media platforms, and if the user is found to have contributed to the infringement, they can potentially be held liable under copyright law, which can result in legal action from the copyright holder.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:02:02.450909+00:00"}

All of that may soon change as NASA and its commercial partners, like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, look to conduct longer-duration missions that would take humans to the moon and Mars.\n\nThat looming reality is pushing NASA to gradually make on-orbit medical care more “Earth-independent.” One early experiment is a proof-of-concept AI medical assistant the agency is building with Google. The tool, called Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA), is designed to help astronauts diagnose and treat symptoms when no doctor is available or communications to Earth are blacked out.\n\nThe multimodal tool, which includes speech, text, and images, runs inside Google Cloud’s Vertex AI environment.\n\nThe project is operating under a fixed-price Google Public Sector subscription agreement, which includes the cost for cloud services, the application development infrastructure, and model training, David Cruley, customer engineer at Google’s Public Sector business unit, told TechCrunch. NASA owns the source code to the app and has helped fine-tune the models. The Google Vertex AI platform provides access to models from Google and other third parties.\n\nThe two organizations have put CMO-DA through three scenarios: an ankle injury, flank pain, and ear pain. A trio of physicians, one being an astronaut, graded the assistant’s performance across the initial evaluation, history-taking, clinical reasoning, and treatment.\n\nThe trio found a high degree of diagnostic accuracy, judging the flank pain evaluation and treatment plan to be 74% likely correct; ear pain, 80%; and 88% for the ankle injury.\n\nThe roadmap is deliberately incremental. NASA scientists said in a slide deck that they are planning on adding more data sources, like medical devices, and training the model to be “situationally aware” — that is, attuned to space medicine-specific conditions like microgravity.\n\nCruley was vague about whether Google intends to pursue regulatory clearance to take this type of medical assistant into doctor’s offices here on Earth, but it could be an obvious next step if the model is validated on orbit.\n\nThe tool not only could improve the health of astronauts in space, “but the lessons learned from this tool could also have applicability to other areas of health,” he said.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:02:09.742563+00:00"}

The outperformance can be attributed to Alphabet’s strong second-quarter 2025 results that revealed the benefits of AI infusion across its Search business and a surge in Google Cloud revenues.\n\n\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Google Search and other revenues increased 11.7% year over year to $54.19 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.04% and accounting for 56.2% of total revenues. Overall queries and commercial queries on Search continued to grow year over year in the reported quarter.\n\n\n\nGoogle continues to dominate the Search business, handling over 5 trillion queries annually, per Semrush. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. Google accounts for 89.66% market share, followed by Microsoft’s MSFT Bing, with 3.88% share.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues surged 31.7% year over year to $13.62 billion and accounted for 14.1% of the quarter’s total revenues. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.24%. The year-over-year growth was driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core GCP products, AI Infrastructure, and Generative AI Solutions. Google Cloud’s annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion.\n\n\n\nThe strong growth in Search and Google Cloud has helped Alphabet shares outperform its closest peers in the cloud computing domain, Microsoft and Amazon. According to Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s AMZN cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, continues to lead with a 30% market share in the second quarter of 2025, while Alphabet and Microsoft had 20% and 13% market share, respectively.\n\nGOOGL Stock’s Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Push to Boost GOOGL’s Prospects\n\nAlphabet is advancing visual and contextual search capabilities. The Circle to Search feature is now active on more than 300 million devices. The company is adding functionalities to help people explore complex topics and ask follow-up questions without switching apps. For instance, gamers can now use Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI Overview or answers.\n\n\n\nAI Overviews now reach more than 2 billion users per month and are available in over 200 countries across 40 languages. It is now driving over 10% more queries globally. Powered by Gemini 2.5, AI Overviews currently delivers the fastest AI responses in the industry. The combination of lens or Circle to Search, together with AI Overviews, is driving multimodal search usage.\n\n\n\nGoogle’s AI-powered Search features are driving deeper engagement, with AI Mode offering advanced reasoning and multimodal responses. Users are generating queries twice as long as those in traditional searches. The launch of AI Mode in the United States and India — where it currently has more than 100 million monthly active users — is expected to drive further growth.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud is benefiting from its partnership with the likes of NVIDIA and PayPal PYPL. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. PayPal will expand its Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven recommendations, transaction processing and enhanced security. The partnership expands the availability and functionality of PayPal’s payment services and capabilities across a range of Google products.\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud’s expanding clientele is expected to boost Alphabet’s top line.

And, as Altman pointed out, one area where it is undoubtedly competing well is price. “Very happy with the pricing we are able to deliver!” he tweeted.\n\nThe top-level GPT-5 API costs $1.25 per 1 million tokens of input, and $10 per 1 million tokens for output (plus $0.125 per 1 million tokens for cached input). This pricing mirrors Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro basic subscription, which is also popular for coding-related tasks. Google, however, charges more if inputs/outputs cross a heavy threshold of 200,000 prompts, meaning its most consumption-heavy customers end up paying more.\n\nBut OpenAI is really undercutting Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1, which starts at $15 per 1 million input tokens and $75 per 1 million output tokens. (Anthropic does, however, offer big discounts for prompt caching and batch processing — storing/reusing prompts and processing multiple requests together.)\n\nAnthropic’s model has been extremely popular among programmers, both as a choice within popular coding assistant Cursor and for powering its own such assistant, Claude Code. (Note that Cursor offered GPT-5 as an option minutes after it was announced.)\n\nDevelopers who have had early access to GPT-5 are touting the pricing. Simon Willison, one of the developers featured in OpenAI’s launch video, writes in his review: “The pricing is aggressively competitive with other providers.”\n\nBut GPT-5 is also priced competitively with GPT-4o. OthersideAI’s co-founder and CEO, Matt Shumer (maker of HyperWrite), writes that GPT-5 “is cheaper than GPT-4o, which is fantastic. Intelligence per dollar continues to increase.”\n\nSome on X called OpenAI’s fees for the model “a pricing killer,” while others on Hacker News are offering similar praise.\n\nWill competitors like Anthropic follow? Will Google — who undercut OpenAI on pricing before — get even more affordable? If so, we could be witnessing the start of a much-awaited LLM price war.\n\nThere’s no doubt a price war would be welcome. The underlying economics of vibe-coding tool providers, for instance, is pretty shaky because of the high and unpredictable fees they have to pay model makers, as TechCrunch’s Marina Temkin reports. And there are countless startups building on top of AI models as well.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:02:14.398140+00:00"}

These chips are engineered to run LLMs more efficiently than Nvidia’s GPUs, accelerating the shift from basic reasoning to groundbreaking invention.\n\nIn August 2024, Groq raised $493.5 million, boosting its valuation to an estimated $5.76 billion, according to Yahoo Finance's private companies data tracker.\n\nRoss said large language models are becoming less mistake-prone, expanding the areas in which they can be used.\n\n\"At some point, they'll make so few mistakes you can use it in medicine, you can use it in law,\" Ross previously said on the Opening Bid podcast.\n\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

As such, this remains a great area to invest in for the long haul. Let's look at three top AI stocks that are not only leading today but are positioned well for the next leg higher.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia (NVDA 0.58%) remains the backbone of the AI data center buildout. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) accounted for a staggering 92% of the GPU market in Q1, and the company isn't slowing down. It has accelerated its product development cycle, and will now look to introduce a new chip every year to help ensure its lead.\n\nThe company's real edge, however, isn't just its chips, it's its software platform CUDA. Nvidia offered its CUDA software platform for free years before AI went mainstream, pushing its use at universities and research institutions. That early move led to an entire generation of developers being trained on its platform, creating a flywheel effect as tools and frameworks got built on top of CUDA to improve its chip performance.\n\nThat strategy has paid off in a big way, as CUDA is now the foundation for AI development. While rivals scramble to catch up in hardware, they're years behind on software. Meanwhile, Nvidia continues expanding into new verticals. Its automotive business, which supports autonomous driving and robotaxis, could be its next big growth driver. The company also just got a boost after the Trump administration signaled that it will allow H20 chip sales in China, adding another growth catalyst.\n\nDespite its massive run, Nvidia still looks attractive with a PEG (price/earnings-to-growth) ratio of under 0.9, with PEGs below 1 considered undervalued. When you combine a dominant market position with explosive growth and a deep moat, Nvidia's long-term outlook remains extremely compelling.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is the world's most advanced foundry, and the go-to partner for top chip designers, including Nvidia. Unlike chip designers, TSMC wins no matter who dominates, as it manufactures the cutting-edge chips that power nearly all of them. That makes it one of the best ways to play the ongoing AI infrastructure boom.\n\nIts dominance in advanced nodes gives it unmatched scale and pricing power. Chips made on 7-nanometer and smaller nodes now represent nearly three-quarters of revenue, with 3nm alone hitting 24% last quarter. Apple has reportedly locked up much of TSMC's future 2nm supply, and the company is working with its top customers to increase its capacity to meet their rising chip demand. This gives it great visibility into future growth.\n\nTSMC's strength was on full display in Q2, with revenue jumping 44% in Q1 to $30.1 billion, driven by demand in high-performance computing. With the company predicting that AI chip demand is set to grow at a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028, it's hard to see this momentum slowing. Best of all, the stock is still trading at an attractive valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 24 based on 2025 analyst estimates and a PEG of 0.6.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) is proving the skeptics wrong. Search is not only surviving AI, it's thriving because of it. The company's AI Overviews are already used by over 2 billion people monthly, and global search queries are rising as a result. Last quarter, its search revenue accelerated to 12% growth, while its new AI Mode and Gemini app are just getting started.\n\nIts cloud computing segment is also booming. Google Cloud revenue surged 32% to $13.6 billion in Q2, while segment profit more than doubled to $2.8 billion. Alphabet's custom AI chips, including its new Ironwood chip, are proving cost-efficient and gaining strong acceptance. Capacity constraints remain a bottleneck; however, that is a good problem to have and why Alphabet will increase its capital expenditures to a whopping $85 billion this year.\n\nAt the same time, Waymo, Alphabet's robotaxi unit, is scaling quickly. Meanwhile, YouTube remains a solid growth driver with Shorts helping push ad revenue up 13% to $9.8 billion in Q2. AI tools like Veo 3 are also making it easier for creators to produce video content, adding another tailwind.\n\nAlphabet's AI push is driving top-line growth across each of its major business segments. The company is still posting double-digit revenue and earnings growth, yet trades at under 19.5 times forward earnings with a PEG of 0.8. That's a cheap valuation for one of the most powerful companies on the planet.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:02:26.817489+00:00"}

These 2 Stocks Could Be Bargain Buys for 2025 and Beyond", "summary": "These stocks are cheap, even though they have great long-term growth potential.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/08/have-1000-these-2-stocks-could-be-bargain-buys-for/", "published_at": "2025-08-08T10:00:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "These stocks are cheap, even though they have great long-term growth potential.\n\nEven though it seems like every stock is soaring, the market is only up a few percentage points since the middle of February. Many stocks are flat or even down year to date (YTD). Starting to invest while the market is at all-time highs may seem foolish, but if you avoid high-flying stocks with premium valuations, there are plenty of cheap-looking companies you can buy right now.\n\nTwo bargain buys for 2025 and beyond are ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%), two technology stocks with long growth runways that are trading at cheap valuations. With just $1,000, you can invest in these stocks and watch your wealth appreciate over the long haul. Here's why.\n\nASML's industry dominance\n\nEven though artificial intelligence (AI) has propelled some industry stocks to all-time highs this year, semiconductor equipment maker ASML is in the gutter. The stock is flat YTD and off 37% from all-time highs. Why is the stock falling when spending on semiconductors and computer chips is projected to keep growing to keep up with AI demand? Because of uncertainty around 2026 revenue due to tariffs.\n\nASML is based in the Netherlands and assembles vast lithography machines that help print tiny designs onto computer chips. These machines are assembled with parts from around the globe and sold into the United States, Taiwan, China, and more. Increased tariff taxes -- especially on machines sold into the United States -- may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay or halt orders of new lithography machines.\n\nThis could hurt ASML's business in 2026. However, in the long run, the company is positioned to benefit from the growing need for advanced computer chips. No company has been able to replicate ASML's advanced lithography technologies, which are required to build advanced computer chips. This means that manufacturers are forced to go to ASML for these machines, which they will need eventually to build these advanced chips, giving ASML pricing power. A new machine is reportedly going for $400 million when sold to customers.\n\nA strong competitive position gives ASML management confidence in making long-term guidance. By 2030, the company expects to hit between 44 billion and 60 billion euros in revenue, compared to 30 billion euros over the last 12 months. The guidance includes profit margin expansion, which has been a consistent theme for ASML due to its strong pricing power.\n\nToday, ASML stock trades at a below-market earnings multiple, with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 25.4. With strong pricing power and good long-term demand for its end markets, ASML is a bargain stock to buy at a price of $700 if you are patient enough to hold for many years into the future.\n\nAlphabet's impressive growth\n\nAnother stock with a beaten down P/E is Alphabet, which owns Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud. Some are speculating that the company will be a loser in AI, even though it keeps putting up impressive financial growth and is proving to be an AI winner.\n\nOn the consumer and individual front, AI is helping Alphabet expand the moneymaking potential of Google Search. Revenue for the division grew 12% year over year last quarter to $54 billion. On top of this, Alphabet's subscription and devices revenue grew 20% year over year to $11.2 billion. This is the segment that houses the Gemini AI chatbot, the advanced conversational AI tool that Alphabet developed and that now has hundreds of millions of users.\n\nLet's not forget the commercial side of things, which is perhaps the biggest bright spot for Alphabet at the moment. Google Cloud grew revenue 32% to $13.6 billion and is turning into another way for Alphabet to monetize its AI infrastructure. With profit margins expanding to 21%, Google Cloud is turning into a real earnings growth driver for the company. It is one of the top places to host for AI-focused cloud computing. It has a huge market share among AI start-ups, which will help the division grow for many years into the future.\n\nAlphabet's business is booming, but look at the P/E ratio and you'd think it was left for dead. The P/E is now at 21, which is significantly lower than its big technology peers' and most other AI companies'. This makes Alphabet an easy bargain buy for your portfolio at today's stock price of $200.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:02:28.191367+00:00"}

OpenAI’s GPT-5 is live and free! You can read all about Sam Altman’s latest LLM model and what this does to its competition with Google and Meta here. How will it impact all the entrepreneurs and business leaders who are building business models around these ever-changing technologies? The answer may be, “not much.”\n\nI spoke with serial entrepreneur Geoff Nudd yesterday, whose startup Anonymous Health deploys AI to help people overcome addiction and unwanted habits. Launched in June, it now serves more than 10,000 users. While Nudd is pleased to have access to more intelligence, he likens the update to the “heyday of semiconductors, where you always want to be planning for what’s going to be out there in 18 months.”\n\nNudd argues there are five main components to delivering value: the LLM, the context, the prompt, the workflow and the evaluation. “It’s those five things working together in concert that really create magic,” he says. “The frontier models are effectively commoditized. How you create value goes back to those other four components.”\n\n“Folks like us will go to whatever is cheapest at some point, because they’re all basically the same,” he added. “If I have the system of record for the industry, plus touch points into other systems, then I have the broadest possible context.”\n\nHis advice: Seek breadth in your systems, go deep in understanding your customer and deploy new capabilities with purpose. Nudd’s model, for example, uses AI to engage users at times of high risk for addictive behavior. It’s a tool to help humans live better lives in an age of AI.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:02:30.019303+00:00"}

The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement.\n\nMeta Platforms shares are trading at a premium compared to Alphabet, Amazon and Snap. In terms of the forward 12-month P/S, Alphabet shares are trading at 6.63X, while Amazon is trading at 3.17X and Snap at 2.09X.\n\nHowever, META shares are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), META is trading at 9.23X, a premium compared with the broader sector’s 6.62X.\n\nShares of Alphabet and Amazon have increased 3.6% and 1.3%, respectively, on a YTD basis. However, Snap shares dropped 27.8%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Snap SNAP.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMETA’s new AI-powered recommendation model for ads drove roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. A meaningful percentage of ad revenues came from campaigns that used one of its Generative AI (Gen AI) features. Smaller advertisers with limited budgets are expected to benefit from these Gen AI features. Enhanced capabilities of Andromeda that powers the ads retrieval stage of META’s ads system have driven nearly 4% higher conversions on Facebook mobile Feed and Reels.\n\nAI push is helping Meta Platforms’ offer content that is interesting and useful, eventually driving engagement. Improvement in content quality driven by META’s recommendation system has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram in the recently concluded second-quarter 2025. The launch of AI video editing tools across Meta AI and the new Edits app are noteworthy developments.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, video engagement improved with Instagram video time jumping more than 20% year-over-year globally. Video time spent on Facebook surged more than 20% year over year. Meta Platforms’ focus on further increasing the freshness of original posts is expected to drive user engagement.\n\nHere’s Why You Should Hold META Stock Right Now\n\nMeta Platforms is spending heavily on expanding AI infrastructure. For 2025, capital expenditure is expected to be between $66 billion and $72 billion (up from $64-$72 billion), driven by META’s Gen AI initiatives and core business.\n\nOperating expenses are expected in the $114-$118 billion range, with headcount expected to increase within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, Gen AI, regulations and compliance. Regulatory concerns in the United States and Europe, along with tariffs and premium valuation, make the stock a risky bet.\n\nAlthough these investments bode well for the company’s longer-term prospects, we believe sluggish monetization of platforms, such as Threads and Meta AI, is a concern. WhatsApp ads in Status are likely to earn a lower average price than Facebook or Instagram ads for the foreseeable future. Meta Platforms does not expect ads in Status to be a meaningful contributor to total impressions or revenue growth for the next few years. Ad revenues are expected to suffer from uncertainty related to higher tariffs and challenging macroeconomic conditions.\n\nMETA currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies that investors should wait for a more favorable point to accumulate the stock.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 3.6% on the news that the White House announced a new round of steep global tariffs, sparking concerns of a trade war and its impact on the U.S. and global economies. This move creates significant uncertainty for businesses and investors. The new tariffs, with rates of up to 41% on imports from 68 countries and the European Union, prompted a broad market sell-off, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index showing notable weakness. Adding to the bearish sentiment was a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which revealed that employers created only 73,000 jobs, far below economists' expectations. This combination of trade fears and signs of a slowing labor market has created a \"risk-off\" environment, leading investors to pull back from growth-oriented sectors like software and technology.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 23.1% since the beginning of the year, but at $427.90 per share, it is still trading 16.8% below its 52-week high of $514.10 from July 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,203.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

Its tenants include leading names such as Eli Lilly, Moderna, and Google, who sign long-term leases—offering predictable, high-quality rental income. As of the latest trading, ARE is priced at $72, yielding a 7.2% dividend, the highest in over a decade. The dividend is well-supported by Funds From Operations (FFO), which totaled $8.11 per share in 2024, with guidance of $9.26 per share for 2025.\n\nAlexandria’s payout ratio remains healthy, and its dividend has increased for 15 consecutive years at a 5.2% CAGR. The REIT boasts a strong balance sheet, with a 0.6x debt/equity ratio, a 12.7-year average debt maturity at a low 3.86% interest rate, and an investment-grade credit rating. The company’s capital allocation strategy centers around its Megacampus model—large-scale, amenity-rich campuses near top research universities. To fund this strategy, ARE has actively recycled capital by selling non-core assets and repurchasing shares, minimizing shareholder dilution. While its occupancy dipped to 91.7% in Q1 due to expected tenant transitions, fundamentals remain intact.\n\nHowever, its tight concentration in the U.S. life sciences sector introduces risk, especially as federal research funding faces political scrutiny.

Discover SCENE\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, OpenAI unveiled the next generation of its flagship AI model, GPT‑5. The new model, which creates a simpler interface to the world’s most popular AI platform, arrives amid mounting pressure from rivals like Meta, Anthropic, and Google.\n\n\"GPT is a significant upgrade over GPT-4 and a significant step along the path to AGI,\" CEO Sam Altman said, noting that among other things, GPT-5 can \"write a software program from scratch. We think this idea of software on demand will be a defining characteristic of the GPT-5 era.\" The new model wrote over 400 lines of code in two minutes, in a \"zero shot\" example from a prompt asking it to do a simulation of the Bernoulli effect.\n\nOne unexpected disappointment: though the new model has a 400K token context window, which is about four times more than GPT-4, it still pales in comparison against Claude or Gemini, which can handle over 1 million tokens of context. This is significant because token-context-window size determines how much information a language model can “remember” and work with in a single interaction—things like documents, codebases, long conversations, or research papers.\n\nClaude 3 and Gemini 1.5 already support over 1 million tokens, making OpenAI’s new model feel like it’s catching up, not leapfrogging. Claude can take in an entire book series, dense research archives, or huge code repositories and still give coherent, context-aware responses.\n\nGPT-5 did offer a raft of new features, including a video option in which it can watch you while you chat (or anything else via your camera). Likewise, next week, the company will begin allowing users to integrate their Gmail and Google Calendars.\n\nThe new model will be available to all GPT users, including the free tier, starting today. Free users will be usage capped; after hitting a limit, they will be automatically rolled over to a \"mini\" model, the company said.\n\nAltman positioned GPT-5 as a qualitative leap in AI capability during Thursday's livestream. \"GPT-4 is like talking to a college student. Now, GPT-5 is like talking to an expert,\" he said, while talking about the company's ambition to move beyond incremental improvements toward fundamentally different AI interactions. Here are some of its new features announced today.\n\nBusiness Integration Focus\n\nThe company emphasized enterprise applications throughout the presentation. \"It will be an especially important moment for businesses,\" Altman noted, highlighting GPT-5's enhanced reasoning capabilities as a potential transformer for corporate workflows and decision-making processes.Unified Reasoning Architecture.\n\nOpenAI described reasoning as central to its artificial general intelligence strategy. \"Reasoning is at the heart of our AGI program,\" the team explained. The breakthrough eliminates previous trade-offs between speed and analytical depth: \"Until now users had to pick between slow answers using reasoning and fast answers with normal token prediction. This model eliminates that barrier.\"\n\nEnhanced Performance Metrics\n\nThe company touted comprehensive improvements across key metrics. \"GPT-5 is faster, more reliable and more accurate\" than its predecessor, according to internal testing. OpenAI also positioned the model as \"the best coding model to date,\" with demonstrated software development capabilities that surpass previous iterations.The model also beats all the scores in different benchmarks shared by the company, especially in math and coding.\n\nEnhanced Safety and Reliability\n\nGPT-5 demonstrates significant improvements in truthfulness and accuracy compared to previous models. \"We found GPT-5 is significantly less deceptive than o3,\" OpenAI reported during the presentation. The reduced hallucination rate addresses one of the most persistent challenges in large language model deployment, particularly for enterprise applications requiring factual precision.\n\nSynthetic Data Breakthrough\n\nOpenAI revealed a new training approach centered on synthetic data generation. \"We are experimenting with a new set of techniques,\" the team explained, describing their methodology shift. \"Our breakthrough was not to create more data but to create the right set of data,\" the company noted, indicating that the synthetic data used for pretraining delivers substantially better results than traditional data collection methods.\n\nPersonalized Memory System\n\nThis is more a ChatGPT feature than a model improvement, but it could heavily impact the way people use ChatGPT. The new model features enhanced memory capabilities that allow users to customize their chatbot's behavior patterns. ChatGPT can now be tailored to specific goals or objectives, making interactions more helpful and aligned with individual user needs. This personalization extends beyond simple preference settings to include behavioral modifications that persist across conversations.\n\nAgentic Coding Excellence\n\nGPT-5 delivers exceptional performance in autonomous coding tasks, handling live implementation and iterative development with natural ease. \"GPT-5 sets a whole new standard. It's the best model at agentic coding tasks,\" the team announced, with co-founder Greg Brockman emphasizing \"It's incredible at front end... It's extremely good at instruction following.\"\n\nThe model eliminates the need to switch between specialized coding assistants, allowing users to rely on GPT-5 for all development phases from planning through debugging. OpenAI presented three variants—GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, and GPT-5 nano—all capable of handling tools, functions, and different programming formats seamlessly. It has also been trained to build apps that are more visually appealing and hhave better frontend understanding\n\nGPT-5 introduces tool call explanations, allowing the model to describe its intended actions before executing them, making task execution more efficient and transparent for developers. Users can adjust verbosity settings to control output length and manage token costs while maintaining functionality. The model achieved top performance on SWE-bench, establishing GPT-5 as the most powerful model for software engineering tasks currently available.\n\nAccess Structure\n\nOpenAI announced a tiered rollout strategy for the new model. Free tier users will start with GPT-5 before transitioning to a lighter \"GPT-5 mini\" version when they deplete their usage quota, while Pro subscribers receive unlimited access to the full model. The company confirmed that all existing ChatGPT features will remain compatible with the new system.\n\nThe company is deprecating its older models, and asked GPT-5 to write an obituary for them, which one of the presenters pointed out was more natural in its reponse, like talking to someone with a higher IQ and higher EQ she said: “It has more rhythm … It’s actually quite personal—and that’s the kind of thing GPT-5 does better... the responses feel less like AI.\" The model also has native multilingual capabilities, making it more capable than other models in multilingual tasks\n\nAn 800-Pound Gorilla in the AI Space\n\nChatGPT currently boasts 700 million weekly active users, compared to Google Gemini’s 47 million weekly users. Despite its large user base, GPT-5 will be competing with Meta AI, whose own weekly user base stands at 700 million, thanks to its integration with Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nTo date, OpenAI has raised $57 billion across 11 funding rounds, according to data from Tracxn, and is valued at $300 billion. According to a Reuters report, that valuation number is expected to rise to $500 billion if a proposed stock sale option goes through. The company doubled its revenue in the first seven months of the year and is expected to reach $20 billion by December 31, Reuters reported.\n\nAltman first publicly confirmed that OpenAI started working on GPT‑5 in 2023, with the actual training phase beginning one year later. On February 13, 2025, Altman outlined the company’s roadmap and said GPT‑5 was expected to launch “within months,” with the aim of unifying OpenAI’s O‑Series and GPT models.\n\nour livestream tomorrow at 10 am PDT will be longer than usual, around an hour. we have a lot to show and hope you can find the the time to watch! — Sam Altman (@sama) August 7, 2025\n\nAltman has recently spent a great deal of time opining about artificial general intelligence, fueling speculation that OpenAI could use today’s event to announce a breakthrough. Earlier this month, however, he cautioned that there could be additional delays in the rollout of GPT, asking users to \"please bear with us.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the launch earlier this week, OpenAI released two open-weight models on Tuesday—gpt‑oss‑120b and gpt‑oss‑20b—under an open license, aimed at developers seeking to run models locally.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:02:42.588144+00:00"}

On Thursday, OpenAI took a major step in its effort to reassert its leadership with the launch of GPT-5, the long-awaited update to its flagship AI product and its most powerful and fastest model yet.\n\nThe company said the model delivers “more accurate answers than any previous reasoning model,” and is “much smarter across the board,” reflected by strong performance on academic and human-evaluated benchmarks. Its research blog noted new state-of-the-art performance across math, coding, and health questions, and found that GPT-5 outperformed other OpenAI models across tasks spanning over 40 occupations including law, logistics, sales, and engineering. In addition, it is being billed as “one unified system” that provides “the best answer, every time,” with no need to choose from what was becoming a laundry list of different OpenAI models.\n\n“GPT-5 really feels like talking to a PhD-level expert in any topic,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told journalists in a pre-briefing on Wednesday. “Something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable in any other time in history.”\n\nAltman described GPT-5 as a “significant step” along the path to artificial general intelligence (AGI), which according to OpenAI’s mission statement is defined as “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.”\n\nOpenAI is making its latest AI model free to all ChatGPT users—the first time free users will have access to one of its reasoning models—as well as through an API that lets developers and businesses build on top of it. OpenAI is also rolling out some new ChatGPT features: Users can choose from four preset personalities—Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd—to customize how the AI responds, while Pro users will soon be able to connect Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts, allowing ChatGPT to reference that information automatically during chats. Voice mode is also getting an upgrade, with more adaptive and expressive responses.\n\nIt’s unclear whether this combination of speed, power, and features will be enough, however. Some two years in the making (GPT-4 was launched in March 2023), GPT-5’s launch has taken longer than many industry insiders expected, as OpenAI has adjusted its approach in response to industry changes. And while ChatGPT now boasts an impressive 700 million weekly users, OpenAI has faced growing pressure over the past year as rivals poach its talent and race ahead on emerging AI techniques like long-context reasoning and autonomous tool use. In addition to Big Tech competitors like Meta and Google, OpenAI must contend with a wave of startups founded by its own former researchers, including Anthropic, Thinking Machines, and Safe Superintelligence. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has emerged as a particularly aggressive rival, forming a new superintelligence team that has lured away several top OpenAI scientists.

While Apple has moved some iPhone assembly to India and explored alternatives like Vietnam, the company's semiconductor packaging and most of its core hardware production still rely on Chinese factories.\n\nBerry emphasized that building out domestic capacity, especially at Apple's scale, will take years. The timeline to secure permits, construct factories, hire and train workers, and begin mass production likely exceeds the next three and a half years, she noted. Additionally, tariffs could shift within that period.\n\n\"I highly doubt that Apple is going to start breaking ground on as much new kind of land,\" Berry said, which means it may not meaningfully change Apple's near-term supply chain exposure.\n\nDespite the cautious outlook, some on Wall Street cheered the news. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan raised the firm's price target from $213 to $250, citing the upside potential if the company is exempt from tariffs.\n\nMohan suggests that if the US government grants Apple an exemption, the company might reduce its projected fourth quarter headwinds of $1.1 billion, although the precise details remain undefined.

AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.48 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, which is now available in more than 200 countries and territories. The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement.\n\n\n\nMETA’s new AI-powered recommendation model for ads drove roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. A meaningful percentage of ad revenues came from campaigns that used one of its Generative AI (Gen AI) features. Smaller advertisers with limited budgets are expected to benefit from these Gen AI features. Enhanced capabilities of Andromeda that powers the ads retrieval stage of META’s ads system have driven nearly 4% higher conversions on Facebook mobile Feed and Reels.\n\n\n\nAI push is helping Meta Platforms’ offer content that is interesting and useful, eventually driving engagement. Improvement in content quality driven by META’s recommendation system has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram in the recently concluded second-quarter 2025. The launch of AI video editing tools across Meta AI and the new Edits app are noteworthy developments.\n\n\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, video engagement improved with Instagram video time jumping more than 20% year-over-year globally.

It’s not exclusive to ChatGPT. We — Airbnb — can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use,” he said.\n\nPainting a broader picture of the AI landscape, Chesky said that in addition to chatbots and other AI agents, there will be custom-built startups designed for specific applications, as well as other incumbents that have made the shift to AI.\n\n“One of the things we’ve noticed is it’s not enough to just have … the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that’s the key,” he said.\n\nThe company told investors it will look to take advantage of AI in a number of ways.\n\nAirbnb shared during the call that its AI customer service agent in the U.S. reduced the percentage of guests contacting a human agent by 15%, for instance. This was actually harder than tackling the lower-hanging fruit involving travel planning and inspiration, Chesky said, because AI agents performing customer service can’t hallucinate. They have to be accurate and helpful at all times.\n\nAirbnb’s customer service agent was built using 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations, and is currently available in English in the U.S. This year, Airbnb will roll it out to more languages, and next year, it will become more personalized and agentic. That means it would be able to understand if someone reaches out to cancel a reservation; not only would it be able to tell them how to do so, but it could also do it for them. The agent could also help plan and book trips.\n\nPlus, AI will come to Airbnb’s search next year, the CEO said.\n\nHowever, the company has not fully fleshed out its plans for working with third-party AI agents, although it’s considering it. Users still need an Airbnb account to make a booking.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:02:56.614625+00:00"}

That will help them avoid heavy losses in a game in which the winners take all and the playing field is tilted heavily toward those with the biggest budgets.\n\nAccording to data from Bloomberg, four of the world’s largest tech firms – Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta – are expected to funnel more than $344 billion into capital expenditures this year, much of which will go toward data centers that feed their lofty AI ambitions.\n\nThey aren’t alone:\n\nAccording to data from Pitchbook, reported by CNBC in late July, AI startups raised more than $104 billion in the first half of 2025, nearly matching the total amount invested in AI startups in 2024. Around two-thirds of all venture funding during that period went to AI.\n\nAnd investors are devising their own AI infrastructure strategies, too. On Wednesday, Apollo Global Management agreed to acquire a majority stake in Stream Data Centers, and Brookfield Asset Management announced a strategy dedicated to developing AI infrastructure, aiming to capitalize on a “significant pipeline of opportunities.”\n\nThe firms are all vying for a piece of a market that’s estimated to be worth multiple trillions, said Brian Sathianathan, CTO and co-founder of Iterate.ai. Some are already starting to see the payoff. Industry darling Nvidia has been able to “sell and move servers with all the data center buildouts,” he said, and the three biggest cloud providers – Google, Amazon and Microsoft – are seeing significant growth. “It’s already working,” he said.\n\nThose that manage to win have a shot at massive returns. “This market’s got the potential to do that,” Sathianathan said. But with all the cash flowing into developments, some companies may be digging themselves into a hole that they’re not able to get out of, he said.\n\n“This is a winner takes all,” said Sathianathan. “If 20 players are vying for a spot that five can fill, then 15 are going to fail. That’s just the nature of free markets.”\n\nSo where does this leave the average enterprise? The best place to start is determining what “core competencies” your business has and how AI fits into them, Sathianathan said.\n\nWhen choosing an AI vendor, he added, it’s best not to put all your eggs in one basket. “I would warn enterprises from fully betting on one Big Tech firm,” he said. Doing so could create a “lock-in” that ends up making it more difficult to switch if better options present themselves. “Bet on a few, and also bet on startups,” he recommended.\n\n“Big companies have invested so much in this,” Sathianathan said. “They’re going to try and put you into a place where you are stuck with their software or their infrastructure.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:02:59.072309+00:00"}

As a tech company, Tesla is heavily invested in artificial intelligence and robotics, but Ritchie has a warning for investors. “It is still too soon to bet on it at this valuation,” he said, “especially since most of Tesla’s developments are focused on autonomous driving, which still faces a lot of challenges including regulatory ones that could delay it for at least a couple of years.”\n\nCompared to other tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon, Tesla still has a higher P/E ratio, but this may be more due to its leadership as a car company.\n\nAs a car manufacturer, Tesla’s market cap of nearly $1 trillion dwarfs that of legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors. However, recent performance has raised concerns. In Q2 2025, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries dropped 13.5%, falling to 384,122 units compared to 443,956 in the same period last year. This decline has impacted earnings and shaken investor confidence in some markets.\n\nAdditionally, according to David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX, an automated trading platform, “[Tesla hasn’t] yet proved that they can dominate the EV market.

The amount of money flowing into this space is incredible, and with the results that many companies have announced recently, it's clear that this success will be ongoing for some time.\n\nSeveral companies could be bought right now with the mindset of holding for three to five years to outperform the market. Here are three of my favorites.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is the parent company of Google, Waymo, YouTube, and the Android operating system. It may look like it has a fairly wide product lineup, but most of its revenue is derived from advertising. Within the advertising segment, Google Search accounts for the majority of revenue.\n\nHowever, the market is worried that Google Search could be replaced by generative AI models, which would eliminate a huge chunk of Alphabet's revenue stream. This is a huge threat to Alphabet and its shareholders, and it's one of the reasons why Alphabet has a dirt-cheap valuation, trading for just 19 times forward earnings compared to the S&P 500's 24 times forward earnings.\n\nAlthough this is a real threat, there isn't a ton of evidence that this is playing out on a wide scale. Google's search engine market share is still 89.6%, and is also growing revenue rapidly. In Q2, its revenue rose 12% year over year.\n\nThis doesn't look like a dying business, and the market may have this one wrong. As a result, I think the risk-reward profile for Alphabet's stock is fantastic at this point, making it an excellent buy now.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (AMZN 0.08%) may not seem like an AI company at first glance, as its online commerce store isn't AI-centric. However, Amazon's largest profit driver, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a key beneficiary of the AI arms race.\n\nAWS is a cloud computing service that allows customers to rent computing power from Amazon. Renting computing power for training AI models has been a popular strategy, as it allows companies to pay as they go, rather than making a huge purchase for an AI supercomputer.\n\nWhile AWS isn't growing as quickly as some of its competitors, it still posted a strong growth rate of 17% in Q2. Furthermore, AWS generated over $10 billion in operating profits, which accounted for 53% of Amazon's total during Q2.\n\nAmazon is more of a cloud computing company than a commerce company right now, which bodes well for the future. With the stock falling after reporting Q2 results, I think it's an excellent buying opportunity right now.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM 0.77%) is the world's leading chip foundry and is cashing in on the massive AI arms race spending spree. TSMC's chips go into many products, but the biggest growth driver right now is Nvidia's GPUs and other high-powered AI computing devices. Thanks to the massive demand for these products, TSMC's revenue is rapidly growing.\n\nIn Q2, revenue was up 44% in U.S. dollars, showcasing its strength. This strong growth is all a part of management's long-term vision of rapidly growing AI revenue over the next few years.\n\nAt the start of 2025, management stated that they expect AI-related revenue to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with overall revenue increasing at nearly a 20% pace. Taiwan Semiconductor is delivering on that promise, and its strong growth should persist for some time.\n\nWith the stock trading for about the same price tag as the S&P 500 (24 times forward earnings), I think it's a smart stock to buy now and hold over the long term.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:07.139560+00:00"}

I'm not talking about finding stocks that can double in under a year, as there is more luck than anything in that approach.

I think there are a handful of stocks that meet this threshold, and each looks like an excellent buy now.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and the Android operating system. However, the most important part of its business by far is Google Search. This division brings in over half of Alphabet's total revenue and has allowed Alphabet to fund various investments.\n\nBut Google Search is under attack. Investors are worried that Google Search will become a victim of generative AI and lose significant market share. While there is some anecdotal evidence that users are defecting from Google to generative AI, the vast majority of the population still uses Google Search.\n\nHowever, investors' fear of Google Search losing market share has caused the stock to fall to a cheap valuation. At less than 20 times forward earnings, Alphabet's stock is cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades for 24 times forward earnings.\n\nAlphabet's business is still growing, with Google Search's revenue rising 12% year over year in Q2 and companywide diluted earnings per share increasing 22%. Combined with Alphabet's cheap stock price, this makes the stock an easy candidate to double in under five years.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is a massive beneficiary of the AI arms race. TSMC is a chip foundry, which means it fabricates chips for companies that are unable to do so themselves. Considering there's only a handful of chip foundries globally, this makes TSMC a top competitor in an industry where there are few other options.\n\nThis cements TSMC at the top of a very important industry, making it a smart investment. It also has massive growth potential, as management projects revenue will increase at a nearly 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. A 20% CAGR over a five-year period results in a revenue gain of almost 150%, so this far exceeds the threshold needed to double in under five years.\n\nTSMC isn't as cheap as Alphabet, trading at 24.7 times forward earnings. However, that's nearly in line with the broader market, which reduces the overall risk of buying this stock today.\n\nAmazon\n\nAt first glance, Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) may not seem like a great candidate to double in five years, as its commerce platform is already dominant. However, that's not the Amazon story investors should be focused on.\n\nAmazon isn't a revenue growth story; it's a profit growth story. This is because Amazon's higher-margin divisions, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising, are growing much faster than the company as a whole. In Q2, Amazon's overall revenue rose 13% year over year.\n\nHowever, AWS saw sales rise 17% and advertising delivered an excellent 23% growth rate. With these two businesses growing much faster than the overall company, it means Amazon's profits will grow much faster, which is exactly what has happened over the past few quarters.\n\nAmazon's profit growth will drive it to double in under five years, and with the market's negative reaction to its Q2 earnings, it makes for an excellent stock to buy right now.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:08.735062+00:00"}

Tech stocks are the muscle behind U.S. markets these days, accounting for 34% of the makeup of the entire S&P 500. They are also outperformers, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average so far this year.\n\nThe lesson here? You need to have tech stocks in your portfolio if you want to outperform the market. Tech stocks are immensely popular these days as companies are racing to train large language models (LLMs) to customize their platforms with generative artificial intelligence (AI) offerings in order to roll out new services and customer experiences before their competitors.\n\nThe race to build AI products is far from over, and buying stocks that will be best positioned to capitalize on the trend is a smart way to invest right now. If you're looking for the best tech stocks for August, I'm recommending Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%).\n\nNvidia\n\nThe unquestioned leader in tech stocks right now is chipmaker Nvidia. As the creator of the most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) that top companies use to power their AI platforms, Nvidia has grown to be the most valuable publicly traded company in the world and was the first to crack the $4 trillion milestone.\n\nNvidia's GPUs can be combined with other chips into clusters that can work faster and more powerfully, which is why they are so prized by companies building AI applications. Jon Peddie Research estimates that Nvidia has a staggering 92% of the GPU market.\n\nThe company will report earnings for its second quarter of fiscal 2026 on Aug. 27, and analysts are expecting another blowout quarter. Of 66 analysts who cover Nvidia on Yahoo! Finance, 59 of them rank Nvidia as a buy or strong buy.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet already reported its quarterly earnings, and Wall Street was impressed. Revenue in Q2 was up 14% to 96.4 billion, while net income was up 19% to $28.19 billion. Alphabet's earnings per share also jumped to $2.31, a 22% gain from a year ago.\n\nThe report was a welcome return to form for Alphabet, which has struggled so far in 2025 amid concerns that platforms such as ChatGPT would eat into the company's massive Google search business. There are also legal issues, as Alphabet is battling with the Justice Department over allegations that it has an illegal monopoly, and there are concerns that the company could be split up.\n\nBut Alphabet has been able to put those concerns to rest, at least for now. Revenue from Google Cloud was particularly strong in the second quarter, rising 32% to $13.6 billion, as the company's Google AI platform is incorporated into its Chrome browser and Google search engine. Alphabet also saw strong growth in Google Search (revenue was up 11.7%) and Google Advertising (up 10.4%).\n\nAlphabet's stock also trades at a low 20.6 price-to-earnings ratio --incredibly attractive for a tech stock that continues to show strong growth.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nThis one goes hand-in-hand with Nvidia, really. If you believe in the growth story powering Nvidia's GPUs, then Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, has the same kind of tailwinds. TSMC is a fabricator of GPUs -- it doesn't design them, but it is one of the biggest companies in the world that actually makes them for Nvidia and others.\n\nIt's a rapidly growing field, as Mordor Intelligence says the GPU market will be $82.7 billion this year and explode to $352.5 billion by 2030. TSMC has an estimated 62% market share of the global foundry market, so it's going to benefit no matter which company has the lead in the GPU race over the next decade. Nvidia's major competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, is also a TSMC customer.\n\nTSMC is also growing its footprint in the U.S. rapidly, with plans to invest $165 billion in facilities in Arizona that should shield it from any tariff concerns in the future.\n\nTSMC's Q2 earnings included revenue of $30.07 billion, up 44.4% from a year ago. The company is projecting Q3 revenue even higher, to be between $31.8 billion and $33 billion.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nEach of these companies is at the forefront of the explosive growth in AI, which is the dominant trend driving the stock market today. All of them would be excellent buys in August to capitalize on the market-driving power of tech stocks.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:12.779176+00:00"}

That's giving Alphabet and Amazon an opportunity to overtake Apple's valuation.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $3 trillion, Apple (AAPL 1.13%) is one of the most valuable publicly traded companies. But the company is lagging behind some of its rivals when it comes to an artificial intelligence strategy, and that's giving other tech companies the potential to eventually leapfrog Apple's market cap in the coming years.\n\nWhile comparing investment opportunities solely based on market cap does paint the entire picture, it's worth considering how some rival tech giants could outpace Apple as they invest in new opportunities. Here's why Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) and Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%) could outpace Apple over the next few years.\n\nAmazon has many irons in the fire\n\nAmazon has a market cap of $2.3 trillion right now, and while the company's share price may have stumbled lately, I think some investors are missing the big picture, which is that Amazon continues to be the dominant force in several markets.\n\nFirst, Amazon is the leading cloud computing company with about 30% of the market. Yes, Microsoft has chipped away at its lead over the past few years, but Amazon still holds the No. 1 spot and still benefits from significant sales growth from its Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAWS sales rose by 18% in the second quarter of 2025, which beat estimates but was below some of its competitors' cloud growth. CEO Andy Jassy has assured investors that his company is committed to its AI cloud computing future and is spending an estimated $118 billion to keep pace with rivals.\n\nAnd then there's the company's e-commerce dominance. Amazon captured about 38% of the e-commerce market in the U.S., leaving Walmart and Target with just 6% and 2%, respectively. With more than 200 million Prime members, Amazon has a customer base that's locked to its platform, and it shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nWhat's more, Amazon is now an advertising powerhouse. The company's ad sales grew 23% in Q2 to $15.7 billion, and it's the company's fastest-growing business. This is an important market for Amazon as the U.S. digital advertising segment expands into a $490 billion market by 2029.\n\nWhen you combine Amazon's long-term opportunities in AI cloud computing, its e-commerce dominance, and its rapidly expanding advertising business, there's plenty of room for Amazon to grow larger over the next several years and potentially overtake Apple's valuation.\n\nAlphabet is making big strides in AI\n\nWith its market cap of $2.3 trillion, Alphabet has the chance to overtake Apple over the next three years as the company continues to benefit from its strong position in AI.\n\nTwo of the most significant ways it can do this are through the company's Gemini chatbot and through its Google cloud services. Gemini usage is growing quickly, with the company having an estimated 400 million monthly active users already.\n\nAlphabet does have its work cut out for it as the company transitions its traditional search tools to its AI Mode, which provides conversational responses to queries, but management says it will expand embedding ads within the AI Mode responses. The company is also implementing AI-powered ads for some of its users, with over 2 million advertisers now using the platform, a 50% increase from the same time last year.\n\nAnd then there's the growth from Google Cloud. While the company is behind Amazon's and Microsoft's market share -- Google has 12% of the market -- it's made significant strides over the past few years, and revenue is growing. Google Cloud sales were up 32% in Q2 to $13.6 billion, and it recently doubled the number of customer deals worth $250 million or more.\n\nWhat's more, Alphabet's shares are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 20, below the S&P 500 index's average of about 29, Alphabet stock looks like a good value right now.\n\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet appear to be taking the appropriate steps to benefit from artificial intelligence and to maintain their dominance in their respective markets. And while there will likely be some growing pains over the next few years as their AI ambitions take shape, their opportunities could propel them ahead of Apple over the next three years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:14.973547+00:00"}

Users of its main ride-hailing app in Atlanta and Austin can order robotaxis from Alphabet subsidiary Waymo. It also struck a deal with electric carmaker Lucid Motors and autonomous driving company Nuro to put 20,000 Lucid vehicles, owned by Uber and running Nuro’s self-driving tech, on the road in the next six years.\n\nSpeaking on the company’s second-quarter earnings call Wednesday, Khosrowshahi raised Uber’s publicly stated ambitions. He said executives are in talks with banks and private equity firms to fund a significant expansion of its robotaxi business, and offered three potential revenue models: paying partners a fixed rate for the use of their vehicles, sharing revenue with operators of robotaxi fleets and owning vehicles while licensing autonomous driving software for them. “Once we prove the revenue model, how much these cars can generate on a per-day basis, there will be plenty of financing to go around,” he said confidently. In the interim, Khosrowshahi has smaller plans:\n\nUber said it will dedicate a “modest” amount of its $7 billion in annual cash flows to fund robotaxi deployments, and could sell minority stakes in companies to finance further expansion. Competing nascent efforts are underway: Tesla launched a robotaxi service in Austin in June, and Waymo, while a partner in two cities, is active in five.\n\nUber posted a better-than-expected revenue increase of 18% in the second quarter on Wednesday and unveiled a $20 billion share buyback plan as it offered an upbeat outlook for the third quarter. Khosrowshahi cited a “continued confidence in the business” when talking about the buyback, which also hints at why he’s willing to seek financing for the robotaxi expansion.\n\nReasonably Robotic: On the earnings call, Uber said there has been no dip in demand in cities where robotaxi services have launched. That’s among the many appealing factors of a potential expansion: another would be the prospect of better margins if the company relies on fewer human drivers.

As of this writing, the stock is down about 8% since the report in late July. The main reason for the stock's severe decline is likely the company's lower than anticipated growth in its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The market may be worried that much faster growth at Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) and Alphabet's (GOOGL 1.14%) cloud businesses is a sign that the important Amazon service is losing its edge in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, investors may have some concerns about Amazon's guidance for third-quarter profitability.\n\nBut has the market overreacted? I believe so. Yes, AWS's slowing growth is something investors should keep an eye on. But the stock's pullback has arguably more than compensated for the increased risks associated with this part of Amazon's sprawling business.\n\nWhat spooked investors\n\nOn the surface of Amazon's second-quarter results, the company crushed it. The e-commerce and cloud-computing juggernaut reported revenue of $167.7 billion, up 13% year over year. Earnings per share grew even faster, climbing 33% to $1.68. The consensus analyst forecast called for revenue and earnings per share of just $162.1 billion and $1.33, respectively.\n\nMaking the report look even better, the company guided for another quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Q3. Specifically, management said it expected revenue for the period to be between $174.0 billion and $179.5 billion, translating to 10% to 13% year-over-year growth.\n\nStill, the company may have missed the mark in the report in two areas.\n\nFirst, AWS revenue grew about 18% year over year. That's a meager growth rate compared with the 39% and 32% year-over-year revenue growth seen at Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, respectively. These two competitors' revenue in their cloud businesses was significantly higher than analysts' average forecasts for the important units, while Amazon's barely beat forecasts. Investors may be concerned that Amazon's lower growth indicates the company isn't effectively capitalizing on cloud-computing opportunities in the rapidly expanding AI services market.\n\nAnother potential reason for investor skittishness is Amazon's guidance for third-quarter operating income to be between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion. The midpoint of this guidance range is $18 billion, representing only 3% year-over-year growth.\n\nA buying opportunity\n\nBut here's where things turn optimistic for investors. Sure, shares have taken a painful hit. But with the stock down more than 9%, the market has arguably overreacted to Amazon's more modest cloud growth compared to its competitors, and to management's muted expectations for third-quarter profitability.\n\nZooming out, this is still a business growing its sales at double-digit rates. In addition, its business is supported by both a robust e-commerce business and a cloud business, which has just nearly 18% year-over-year top-line growth -- slightly faster than the segment's growth rate in the prior quarter. Sure, it may not be as fast as Azure's and Google Cloud's growth. But it's still a very strong rate.\n\nWith the stock now trading at just 33 times earnings, this is a rare opportunity for investors to buy into one of the United States' best companies at a reasonable valuation. Sure, there's no telling where the bottom is. Shares could get cheaper. Additionally, the risks of Amazon losing its edge as AI becomes more central to cloud computing are real. Investors, therefore, will have to continue keeping tabs on how AWS performs in the coming quarters. Ultimately, however, risks seem largely priced in. The long-term investment outcome from this price will likely be respectable.\n\nSo should investors buy the dip in Amazon stock? I think so.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:18.201626+00:00"}

Touted as a portal to the future, this augmented-reality headset promised to seamlessly meld our digital and physical realities. Journalists had been buzzing since 2012, and by its soft launch, industry pundits were confidently declaring the “year of wearable tech.” Yet, instead of a mass-market debut, Glass was exclusively released to a select group of ‘Explorers,’ predominantly in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nIn retrospect, this proved to be the project’s undoing. It starkly divided the tech landscape into literal “haves” and “have-nots,” with influential early adopters granted a glimpse into tomorrow while the rest of us were left to merely observe – and, disconcertingly, be observed. These Explorers quickly earned the moniker “Glassholes,” and concerns over privacy fuelled a slew of critical articles.\n\nThen, without fanfare, it vanished. By 2015, commercial production had ceased, transforming what was once hailed as inevitable progress into a cautionary tale. Google Glass didn’t falter due to a lack of technical prowess. Its demise stemmed from Google’s fundamental misjudgement of the public’s appetite for a solution to a problem they simply didn’t have. This is a crucial lesson we too often overlook, particularly within the financial services sector: nor every innovation equates to progress. Sometime, genuine progress lies in enhancing what already works.\n\nWhat defines true innovation?\n\nAt its core, innovation is the act of creating something new. However, new doesn’t automatically translate to better. Financial services, especially payments, have witnessed their fair share of novelty over the last decade. Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) stands out as a particularly prominent example – disruptive, widely adopted and undeniably innovative. Yet, this model is now facing intense scrutiny and increasing regulatory pressure. Critics argue that BNPL encourages overextension, fosters poor financial habits and lacks the consumer protections inherent in traditional credit.\n\nBNPL embodies a central tension in financial innovation: the quest for convenience clashing with the imperative to prevent exploitation. When the pace of innovation outstrips regulatory frameworks or ethical considerations, we risk developing systems that, while appearing sleek, ultimately prove unsustainable.\n\nThe past few years have also seen an explosion of blockchain-based financial products: decentralised finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a proliferation of altcoins and memecoins. Much of this activity promised to “democratise” finance and dismantle traditional systems. Yet, beyond a relatively niche audience, the vast majority of these projects have failed to achieve practical impact or long-term credibility. Their collapse or stagnation underscores the peril of mistaking mere novelty for genuine necessity.\n\nGlobalData Strategic Intelligence US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate? Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. By GlobalData Learn more about Strategic Intelligence\n\nCan progress exist without innovation? Absolutely. Some of the most significant advancements don’t spring from entirely new concepts, but from systemic changes – for instance, mandating that bank accounts must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. Placing NFTs alongside accessibility initiatives highlights the often-tenuous link between innovation and true progress.\n\nEscaping the legacy trap\n\nThe financial services industry frequently relies on infrastructure that is decades old. Many of the systems processing our daily transactions are built on technologies that have been in place since the 1980s or even earlier. While these legacy systems may be trusted, that doesn’t necessarily make them resilient enough for modern demands. While these systems are indeed ripe for an upgrade, we must be careful not to discard the aspects that function effectively while we prune the less efficient components.\n\nHowever, modernising infrastructure doesn’t always necessitate a blank slate. In many instances, the more meaningful form of progress is found in strengthening, streamlining and securing the systems that already underpin the global economy. In essence, this can involve utilising existing solutions more effectively or, as was the case with expanding access to bank accounts, making them more widely available.\n\nIt’s not that innovation is inherently perilous; rather, it’s innovation for its own sake – detached from purpose, regulation, or practical application – that often leads nowhere. Frequently, what’s truly needed is to genuinely understand what people require and then respond accordingly. Innovations like the iPod, which seemingly materialise from thin air to offer something previously unimaginable (“1,000 songs in your pocket”), are rare. Far more common are creations like the Miracle Mop, which apply intelligent thinking to existing designs.\n\nThere’s a prevailing myth within fintech circles that regulation stifles innovation. In reality, it often serves as a crucial foundation. Regulation provides the clarity and stability essential for innovations to scale, particularly when they touch sensitive areas such as data privacy, fraud prevention, or consumer protection.\n\nSimultaneously, innovation can easily outpace existing regulatory frameworks. This isn’t an argument for disregarding regulation, but for approaching innovation with a keen sense of caution and responsibility. The recent collapse of several unregulated or poorly regulated digital finance platforms serves as a stark reminder of the consequences when innovation races ahead without adequate guardrails.\n\nProgress, properly understood\n\nThe true engine of progress in payments isn’t the next flashy app or groundbreaking protocol; it’s the intersection of clear regulatory thinking, astute problem-solving and the pragmatic application of technology. A prime example of this is the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). Introduced in response to growing concerns around fraud and digital security, it not only addressed immediate problems but also laid the groundwork for future innovation.\n\nPSD2 enabled the rise of Open Banking across Europe, granting consumers greater control over their data and creating new opportunities for fintech companies to offer improved, more personalised services. This is innovation grounded in genuine need, informed by robust regulation and aligned with consumer interest. In other words, it represents meaningful progress.\n\nTechnology isn’t the only – or even the most important – arena for innovation. One of the most overlooked opportunities lies in education. Financial literacy and inclusion remain deeply uneven across demographics and geographies. Without addressing this foundational issue, even the most elegant solutions will inevitably leave many behind.\n\nProgress that genuinely benefits people means ensuring they can understand and use financial tools with confidence. Sometimes the right innovation isn’t an app, but a curriculum. Not a new platform, but a clearer explanation. Even the most sophisticated technological systems are useless if they’re inaccessible to those they’re intended to serve.\n\nRebuilding on solid ground\n\nThe tech industry’s long-standing infatuation with the mantra “move fast and break things” is drawing to a close. The collapse of several high-profile startups and the tightening of venture capital in a post-cheap-credit era have fostered a new sentiment – one that prioritises resilience over reckless risk, and clarity over chaos.\n\nIn this evolving environment, payments companies and fintechs are beginning to ask more intelligent questions. Not “What can we build?” but “What do people need?” Not “How can we replace what exists?” but “How can we improve it?”\n\nGoogle Glass wasn’t a complete failure – It was an experiment, and experiments hold value. However, it serves as a potent reminder that simply being ahead of your time isn’t enough. The future doesn’t belong to those who shout the loudest about change. It belongs to those who genuinely understand where change is needed – and then build responsibly and with purpose.\n\nInnovation is merely a means to an end.

It's now the largest company in the entire world thanks to its market capitalization of $4.3 trillion, but I think its stock still has room for upside.\n\nNvidia supplies the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which have become the gold standard for AI development. Tech giants like Alphabet and Meta Platforms recently told shareholders they plan to spend more on AI data center infrastructure this year than originally anticipated, and they are among the chipmaker's largest customers.\n\nNvidia is scheduled to release its financial results for its fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended July 30) on Aug. 27. Here's why I think the report could be a catalyst for more upside in its stock.\n\nAI infrastructure spending continues to climb\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU was the hottest data center chip for AI training and AI inference workloads in 2023, when large language models (LLMs) started going mainstream. Those LLMs were great at delivering one-shot responses, which created a fast and convenient way for users to find information, but they were sometimes inaccurate.\n\nThe latest generation of AI models focuses on \"reasoning,\" which means they spend more time operating in the background to weed out errors before rendering responses. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, these models consume up to 1,000 times more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) than the old one-shot LLMs, so they require substantially more computing capacity.\n\nNvidia developed the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPU architectures to deliver that capacity. Blackwell Ultra GPUs like the GB300 offer up to 50 times more performance than the H100 in certain configurations, and these chips were forecast to start shipping in the second half of calendar year 2025. Since Nvidia's fiscal Q2 2026 included July, investors should expect a sales update in the company's upcoming earnings report on Aug. 27.\n\nAll signs point to astronomical demand, because many of Nvidia's largest customers continue to ramp up their data center infrastructure spending. Alphabet, for instance, just raised its 2025 capital expenditures (capex) forecast from $75 billion to $85 billion. Meta Platforms also increased the low end of its capex guidance from $64 billion to $66 billion, but the company says it could spend up to $72 billion.\n\nAmazon, on the other hand, allocated $55.7 billion to capex during the first two quarters of 2025, and its guidance suggests that its full-year spending could top a whopping $118 billion. Most of that will go toward AI data center infrastructure and chips.\n\nNvidia's upcoming report could be another blockbuster\n\nNvidia's guidance suggests that its total revenue came in at around $45 billion in Q2 of fiscal 2026, which would be a 50% increase from the year-ago period. If previous quarters are any indication, the data center segment likely represented around 90% of total revenue, led by GPU sales.\n\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests that the company also delivered earnings of around $1 per share during the quarter, which would be a 47% jump year over year. This number can influence Nvidia's valuation, and hence the direction of its stock, so it's an important one for investors to watch.\n\nWall Street will also focus on management's forecast for the upcoming fiscal 2026 third quarter, because it's likely to reflect demand for the new Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Analysts will be looking for revenue guidance of around $52 billion, so any number above that could be very bullish for Nvidia stock.\n\nNvidia stock could soar after Aug. 27\n\nNvidia reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 on May 28, and its stock is up 33% since then. I think the Q2 report on Aug. 27 will be another upside catalyst, as long as the company's results don't fall short of expectations.\n\nNvidia stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 60.1 as of this writing. That's right in line with its 10-year average, suggesting it's at fair value. However, the picture looks very different if we value the stock based on the company's future potential earnings.\n\nWall Street predicts that Nvidia will deliver earnings of $4.30 per share during fiscal 2026 overall, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 43. In other words, the stock would have to climb by 40% over the next six months just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 60.1.\n\nSince so many of Nvidia's top customers have increased their capex forecasts for this year, I think the company will easily meet expectations on Aug. 27, and potentially even exceed them. Either of those scenarios will lay the groundwork for more upside in its stock from here.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:20.924442+00:00"}

The facilities will make components that ultimately go into the iPhone and other devices shipped around the world, Apple said. It’s also teaming up with Samsung to create new chips in Texas that can boost the power and performance of devices.\n\nWorking with GlobalWafers Co. in Texas to produce US wafers — the basis for the chips that go into the iPhone and other devices. Apple also said it was partnering with Applied Materials Inc. ( AMAT ), the biggest US producer of semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, to make more of that gear in Austin. But in those cases, Apple will be on the sidelines, rather than building the machinery and components itself.\n\nThe iPhone maker also discussed increased agreements focused on semiconductor manufacturing, expanding deals with partners like Samsung Electronics Co. ( 005930.KS ), Texas Instruments Inc. and Broadcom Inc. Apple is branding the effort the American Manufacturing Program, or AMP.\n\n“Apple’s been an investor in other countries a little bit. I won’t say which ones, but a couple. And they’re coming home,” Trump said when making the announcement. The $600 billion investment, he said, is “the biggest there is.”\n\nA centerpiece of the expansion is a $2.5 billion investment into Corning Inc. ( GLW ), Apple’s longtime glass supplier. For the first time, the cover glass for all iPhones and Apple Watches will be manufactured in the US, at Corning’s facility in Kentucky. Though Apple has touted the US roots of iPhone glass before, a portion of that glass was previously made overseas.\n\nStanding in the Oval Office on Wednesday between Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Cook announced that Apple will increase its US investment commitment to $600 billion over four years — up from the $500 billion pledged after Trump’s second-term victory.\n\n(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is using a familiar strategy to stay in Donald Trump’s good graces: expanding existing initiatives to show he supports the president’s “Made in the USA” agenda.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn all, the announcements provided just enough evidence that Apple was focusing on America — without forcing it to make major changes. Corning has supplied Apple since the first iPhone in 2007, and Cook has long promoted the iPhone’s American-made glass. What’s new is the modestly increased scale.\n\nApple is pointing to the deals as it seeks relief from looming tariffs. The Trump administration is letting exemptions on smartphone and gadget levies expire and adopting new duties on Indian imports — a potential issue for Apple, which recently shifted US-bound iPhone assembly to India.\n\nCook even seized on Trump’s famous love of gold. He presented the president with a large, circular Corning glass plaque engraved with the president’s name, mounted in 24-karat gold. The Apple CEO said that the glass came off an assembly line in Kentucky while the gold was produced in Utah. Cook added that a former US Marine who works at Apple designed the plaque.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, announced a major enticement: He said that companies investing in the US — even if the projects are in early stages — would get a break from some tariffs.\n\n“The good news for companies like Apple is, if you’re building in the United States, or have committed to build,” Trump said, “there will be no charge.”\n\nApple’s pledges are expected to meet that criteria, even if it isn’t actually making iPhones and other popular devices in the US. Assembly of the smartphone — a costly and complex process of combining components, testing and boxing devices — will continue in China and, increasingly, India.\n\nThat part will stay “elsewhere for a while,” Cook said. But “there’s a lot of content in there from the United States, and we’re very proud of it.”\n\nTrump acknowledged that assembly was “set up in other places, and it’s been there for a long time,” but he reiterated his desire to bring that stage of production to the US someday.\n\n“This is a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America,” he said.\n\nTrump’s existing tariffs have already taken a toll on Apple. It said last week that the levies will cost the company about $1.1 billion in the September quarter. But Apple is looking to avoid incurring further costs, especially as it prepares to unveil the iPhone 17 line next month.\n\nCook is also likely seeking support from Trump on other fronts: The US Justice Department is suing the company for alleged antitrust violations, and the agency is threatening its $20 billion search deal with Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOG) in a separate case. The US government also could potentially help Apple cope with tough new restrictions on the App Store in the EU.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Apple has used US manufacturing announcements to promote Trump’s priorities. In 2019, the company promised to assemble a new Mac Pro in Texas. It wasn’t a big change: Apple had produced the previous model in the state since 2013. But that gesture helped land the company a reprieve from tariffs.\n\nEarlier this year, after Trump’s return to office, Cook unveiled the initial $500 billion commitment — an acceleration of the investments Apple had begun under President Joe Biden. At that time, Apple announced it would start making AI servers in Houston.\n\nCook said Wednesday that the first test units rolled off that factory’s assembly line last month.\n\n“We’re going to keep building technologies at the heart of our products right here in America,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:26.689059+00:00"}

Trump administration officials have suggested that Apple could assemble its phones and other electronics domestically using robotics.\n\nApple said last week that it took an $800 million hit from tariffs in the June quarter — slightly less than previously projected — and expected them to add $1.1 billion its costs in the September quarter, assuming no policy changes or new duties.\n\nDuring a call last week with analysts, Cook said “the vast majority” of iPhones sold in the US come from India, while the bulk of other products, such as MacBooks, iPads and Apple Watches, sold in the US are manufactured in Vietnam.\n\n“We obviously try to optimize our supply chain,” Cook said at the time. “And ultimately, we will do more in the United States.”\n\nBut onshoring manufacturing, particularly for the iPhone product line, would amount to a massive undertaking for Apple, whose facilities in China and India employ several hundred thousand people and involve heavily customized processes.\n\nInstead, Cook has led a push to win a tariff carve-out for the company’s most important products. Trump is readying plans to unveil levies on all products containing semiconductor chips as soon as next week. Separately, the president’s country-specific tariffs on dozens of trading partners are set to take effect on Thursday.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Apple was able to convince Trump to exempt its products from import taxes. If Cook is able to do so again, it could help the company avoid costs that analysts expected to erode profit margins and increase consumer prices — or even offer a competitive advantage over foreign rivals including Samsung Electronics Co.\n\nCook has sought to curry favor with Trump over a series of private meetings and dinners, and was among a small group of tech leaders — including Elon Musk, Alphabet Inc.’s Sundar Pichai, Meta Platforms Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos — who attended the president’s second inauguration at the US Capitol.\n\nStill, Apple’s initial $500 billion, 20,000-job pledge, first announced in February, represented just a slight acceleration over its prior investments and previously announced plans, adding $39 billion in spending and an additional 1,000 jobs annually.\n\nThe Apple event is the latest in a flurry of announcements Trump has made alongside corporate leaders who have said they plan to increase their US presence.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump announced a $100 billion investment in artificial intelligence data centers from Oracle Corp., SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI Inc. — with a goal of increasing the total to at least $500 billion — a bid to boost American innovation in technology and artificial technology. OpenAI and Oracle later announced they will develop 4.5 gigawatts of additional US data-center capacity in an expanded partnership.\n\nThe president has also ramped up partnerships with key players in the chip industry, announcing that Nvidia Corp., the dominant player in chips for AI models, plans to produce as much as half a trillion dollars’ worth of AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years through manufacturing partnerships.\n\nTrump has also made securing investments a key part of negotiating with other countries on geopolitical issues, such as trade.\n\nPart of the US’ deal with the European Union included an agreement from the EU to purchase $750 billion in American energy products and invest $600 billion in the US, while the president’s deal with Japan includes the creation of a $550 billion fund to make investments in the US.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:33.304118+00:00"}

Additionally, average click quality has increased and we’re actually sending slightly more quality clicks to websites than a year ago (by quality clicks, we mean those where users don’t quickly click back — typically a signal that a user is interested in the website). This data is in contrast to third-party reports that inaccurately suggest dramatic declines in aggregate traffic — often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the roll out of AI features in Search.”\n\nAmong those reports, and the one that Google’s specifically taking aim at, is a recent study published by Pew Research, which was based on search history data from a pool 0f 900 users.\n\nPew’s data showed that users who had encountered an AI summary in the SERP clicked on a traditional search result link in 8% of all sessions, while those who didn’t see an AI summary clicked on a search result nearly twice as often (15%).\n\nThat seems significant, and marks a significant shift in search activity, and the study has been widely quoted and held up as an example of the broader impacts of Google’s AI shift.\n\nBut Google has specifically called this one out as being based on flawed input, due to its relatively small study pool.\n\nI mean, I guess 900 users is a small sample size, especially when you consider that billions of people are using Google every day. But as an indicative measure, the data here would likely suggest that there’s been at least some relative impact on referrals. Right?\n\nGoogle says no.\n\n“With AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex. In addition, with AI Overviews people are seeing more links on the page than before. More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked.”\n\nSo AI previews are actually better for referral traffic, in Google’s view, and while it does concede some impact:\n\n“For some questions where people are looking for a quick answer, like ‘when is the next full moon,’ people may be satisfied with the initial response and not click further. This has also been true for other answer features we’ve added, like the Knowledge Graph or sports scores. But for many other types of questions, people continue to click through, as they want to dig deeper into a topic, explore further or make a purchase.”\n\nIts main contention is that while traffic is declining to some sites, it’s increasing to others, including those with forums, videos, podcasts, and posts, which are all seeing an uptick in Google traffic.\n\n“People are also more likely to click into web content that helps them learn more — such as an in-depth review, an original post, a unique perspective or a thoughtful first-person analysis. Sites that meet these evolving user needs are benefiting from this shift and are generally seeing an increase in traffic.”\n\nSo Reddit. Reddit is seeing more traffic, and you’ve no doubt seen more Reddit links appearing in SERPs.\n\nBut still, maybe these notes provides some guidance as to what you should be including on your sites to better cater to AI previews, and evolving search behaviors. Though it’s also notable that Google hasn’t shared any specific data points to back these claims up.\n\nGoogle’s just saying that it’s all fine, that you’re probably not losing traffic, and if you are, others are winning out.\n\nSo it’s all good, the broader web is better off overall. Enough with the fear mongering, right?\n\nWell, no.\n\nBecause as noted, that still means that many sites are losing traffic, and that’s having a big impact on many businesses.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, for example, reported back in June that organic search traffic has declined for every major news organization. Based on data provided by Similarweb, WSJ says that HuffPost’s organic search traffic has dropped by more than half over the past three years, while The Washington Post and Business Insider have seen similar patterns.\n\n“Business Insider’s traffic from Google searches alone dropped 55% between April 2022 and April 2025, based on data from Similarweb.”\n\nThat, among other factors, forced Business Insider to cut staff by 21% back in June, citing “extreme traffic drops” as one of the challenges it’s facing.\n\nA pessimist could say that this was opportunistic, as Business Insider is also experimenting with ChatGPT for content creation, and it may well be using this as a reason to back up its push to reduce staff. But the decline in overall traffic is undeniable, and is going to impact all businesses that make money from Google Ads and the like.\n\nAnd there are various other reports:\n\nThe Current recently reported that traffic to the world’s 500 most visited publishers dropped 27% year-over-year versus February last year\n\nLast month, Digiday reported that since the U.S. launch of Google’s AI Overviews in May 2024, the number of searches for news that result in no click-throughs to new s websites has grown from 56% to nearly 69%\n\nAuthoritas found that a site previously ranked first in a search result could lose about 79% of its traffic for that query if results were delivered below an AI overview.\n\nThat said, SimilarWeb, a key reference point for a lot of this type of data, has also reported that AI referrals to websites have increased by 357% since June 2024, which may support what Google’s saying about a re-distribution of Search traffic, as opposed to the top publishers taking up all the SERP space.\n\nIt’s not clear if that’ll offset the losses that are being reported, but maybe, this is indicative of Google’s statements.\n\nThough the concern remains. Even based on Google’s explanation, many sites are indeed losing out, and will have to reassess their traffic generation process.\n\nAnd with AI Overviews only currently being displayed for 20% of desktop searches, there’s also the question of what happens as Google increases this, and how that will impact the broader web.\n\nGoogle says that it “cares passionately about the web ecosystem,” and that it’s very mindful of these impacts.\n\nBut right now, Google says, there’s nothing to worry about.\n\nIn overall terms, at least.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:34.493255+00:00"}

And while chatbots like ChatGPT have certainly seen traffic increase in recent months, that doesn’t mean online publishers aren’t suffering.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nGoogle has been revamping its search engine for years to answer more questions directly on the search results page, and now does so with AI through its “AI Overviews” that appear at the top of search results. Google also allows users to interact with an AI chatbot for some queries. Yet Google denies that this is significantly reshaping the search landscape.

After all, that’s where the chip giant realizes revenue on the sale of its high-powered AI processors.\n\nBut the Data Center segment includes more than just chip sales. It also accounts for some of Nvidia’s most important, though often overlooked, offerings: its networking technologies.\n\nComposed of its NVLink, InfiniBand, and Ethernet solutions, Nvidia’s networking products are what allow its chips to communicate with each other, let servers talk to each other inside massive data centers, and ultimately ensure end users can connect to it all to run AI applications.\n\n“The most important part in building a supercomputer is the infrastructure.

And it’ll continue to grow as customers continue to build out their AI capacity, whether that’s at research universities or massive data centers.\n\n“It is the most underappreciated part of Nvidia's business, by orders of magnitude,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “Basically, networking doesn't get the attention because it's 11% of revenue. But it's growing like a rocket ship.”\n\nConnecting thousands of chips\n\nWhen it comes to the AI explosion, Nvidia senior vice president of networking Kevin Deierling says the company has to work across three different types of networks. The first is its NVLink technology, which connects GPUs to each other within a server or multiple servers inside of a tall, cabinet-like server rack, allowing them to communicate and boost overall performance.\n\nThen there’s InfiniBand, which connects multiple server nodes across data centers to form what is essentially a massive AI computer. Then there’s the front-end network for storage and system management, which uses Ethernet connectivity.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang presents a Grace Blackwell NVLink72 as he delivers a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025.

But it gets better.\n\nMeta’s AI ad engine delivered a 3% boost in conversion rates on Facebook and a 5% bump on Instagram: massive numbers in the digital ad world.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta AI – the company’s consumer-facing chatbot – now boasts over 1 billion monthly active users.\n\nNot to mention, the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are flying off the shelves, with sales tripling over the year. Demand continues to outpace supply.\n\nWe see it as an indicator of what’s to come…\n\nCross-Sector Earnings Show AI’s Total Market Domination\n\nAnd that’s the point: AI isn’t just transforming how people engage with apps. It’s reshaping how work gets done across every sector of the economy.\n\nFor example, surgical robot maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) crushed estimates this Q2 seasons, with 14% growth in AI-powered robot installations and 21% revenue growth. It looks like hospitals are adopting AI faster than medical schools can update their textbooks…\n\nAI insurance disrupter Lemonade (LMND) posted 24% customer growth and 35% revenue growth, showing that AI is now winning even in heavily regulated industries.\n\nAutonomous trucking startup Aurora (AUR) has now completed over 20,000 miles driverless between Dallas and Houston and is expanding operations to Arizona – nighttime driving included.\n\nAnd behind the scenes, the companies building the hardware, chips, and infrastructure for this AI revolution reported some of their strongest quarters ever.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), Celestica (CLS), Rambus (RMBS), Cadence (CDNS), Seagate (STX), Vertiv (VRT), Lam Research (LRCX), Impinj (PI), BWX Technologies (BWXT), Arista Networks (ANET), Astera Labs (ALAB)…\n\nFrom chips and cooling to networking and power, the multi-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure buildout is only accelerating.\n\nAI Software Spending Is Soaring\n\nThough, infrastructure is only half the story. The other half is software: the intelligent platforms that help enterprises harness AI to supercharge their workflows.\n\nAnd after delivering blowout Q2 results, enterprise software juggernauts ServiceNow (NOW) and Palantir (PLTR) displayed just how profitable this part of the story really is.\n\nServiceNow’s revenue grew over 20%, fueled by red-hot demand for AI software. The number of AI deals surged 50%. Plus, the company landed its largest AI contract ever – a single $20 million deal for its Now Assist platform.\n\nMajor customers like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Nvidia (NVDA), and Standard Chartered are all rolling out ServiceNow’s AI agents across their global operations.\n\nIn other words, trillion-dollar companies across the board are embedding AI solutions into their workflows, making demand stronger than ever right now. And there’s no signs that’ll change anytime soon.\n\nWe’re seeing the same thing play out with Palantir (PLTR).\n\nThe company reported nearly 50% revenue growth in Q2, surpassing $1 billion in quarterly revenues for the very first time.\n\nJust a few years ago, it was bringing in less than $400 million a quarter… meaning AI adoption has resulted in 150%-plus growth.\n\nBut the success isn’t restricted to revenue. This past quarter, PLTR closed 157 $1-million-plus deals, 66 of which are worth over $5 million – and 42 over $10 million.\n\nThat is astounding – and screams that Palantir is becoming the backend infrastructure for AI’s transformation across industries.\n\nThe Physical AI Revolution Starts with Amazon\n\nAnd yet, in our opinion, the most powerful AI transformations aren’t happening in software. Instead, they’re unfolding on the warehouse floor.\n\nOften, the headlines surrounding AI focus on flashy chatbots and cloud wars. But as we’ve pointed out before, AI is increasingly going physical.\n\nSelf-driving cars, automated factories… humanoid robots.\n\nAnd Amazon (AMZN) is a potent example of just how physical AI can reshape legacy business models.\n\nThis past quarter, the company’s e-commerce revenues rose 11%, and retail margins hit fresh highs. Net sales reached $167.7 billion, up 13% year‑over‑year. And operating income hit $19.2 billion, corresponding to an operating margin of about 11.4% – up from roughly 9.9% in Q2 2024.\n\nDriving this outperformance? Robots.\n\nAmazon recently hit a new milestone with 1 million robots deployed in its warehouses, nearly outnumbering the company’s human workers. These AI-driven machines are optimizing throughput, slashing costs, reducing errors, and seemingly turning warehouses into high-efficiency cash factories.\n\nIndeed, this was Amazon’s best retail quarter since 2021; and AI is driving its metamorphosis.\n\nMiss This AI Wave, Miss the Future\n\nEarnings season has made one thing abundantly clear: all the growth in today’s economy is happening inside the AI ecosystem. Everything else is just noise.\n\nAI is boosting productivity, supercharging revenues, and widening profit margins.\n\nIt’s creating new markets, changing how work is done, how products get made, and how decisions are reached across every industry on the planet.\n\nWe’re in the middle of the most profound platform shift in human economic history.\n\nIf you want to capture that growth – while ensuring your financial future is secure – there’s only one move to make:\n\nGo all-in with AI.\n\nAnd now’s the time to move… Because AI’s next phase is quickly moving out of the theoretical and into the physical.\n\nWe’re closer than ever to ubiquitous robots that move freight, drones that deliver goods, and machines that diagnose disease – all powered by a huge new AI development set to arrive just 100 days from now.\n\nThis will mark a “Day Zero” moment for investors: a rare inflection point where AI begins reshaping the physical world… and potentially unleashing a $20 trillion economic wave.\n\nMy colleagues Louis Navellier, Eric Fry, and I have identified seven key companies at the heart of this transformation – hardware makers, robot builders, rare earth suppliers – to get you in on the ground floor of AI’s biggest wave yet.\n\nIf it’s true that every major technology wave ends up creating at least 3X more value than the one before it, this shift is one you can’t afford to miss.\n\nCheck out our Day Zero Portfolio now.\n\nThe post Earnings Season Makes It Clear: AI Is the Only Game in Town appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:43.736975+00:00"}

The tool sort of functions like an AI tutor, as it’s designed to help users build a deep understanding instead of just getting answers.\n\nThe launch follows just over a week after OpenAI rolled out Study Mode for ChatGPT, which is also designed to go beyond simply obtaining answers to questions by actually helping users develop critical thinking skills.\n\nBoth companies’ launches come amid concerns that AI chatbots undermine the learning process because they spit out direct answers. The new tools from Google and OpenAI likely aim to address these concerns by positioning their chatbots as learning tools rather than simple answer engines.\n\nWith Guided Learning, Gemini will break down problems step-by-step and adapt explanations to its users’ needs. The feature responds using images, diagrams, videos, and interactive quizzes to help users build and test themselves on their knowledge, rather than simply giving them the answer.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nGoogle says the feature will help users uncover the “why” and “how” behind concepts.\n\n“Whether you’re preparing for an exam about enzymes, starting the first draft of a paper on the importance of bee populations in supporting our food systems, or exploring your passion for photography, Guided Learning is a collaborative thinking partner that helps you get it — each step of the way,” wrote Maureen Heymans, Google’s VP of Learning & Sustainability, in the blog post.\n\nIn addition to the new feature, Google announced that it’s working to make Gemini as a whole better equipped to help users learn. Gemini will now automatically incorporate images, diagrams, and YouTube videos directly into responses to help users better understand complex topics. Plus, users can now also ask Gemini to create flashcards and study guides based on their quiz results or other class materials.\n\nGoogle also announced on Wednesday that it’s offering students in the U.S., Japan, Indonesia, Korea, and Brazil a free one-year subscription to Google’s AI Pro plan.\n\nThe plan includes expanded access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, NotebookLM, Veo 3, Deep Research, and more.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:45.563759+00:00"}

The report raises concern that the White House would use the division as a political tool.\n\nThe fired officials, Roger Alford and William Rinner, who served in Trump's first administration, had been working on the department's challenge to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) acquisition of rival Juniper Networks (JNP.SG), the report said — before a settlement was reached with HPE's politically connected lawyers, who lacked antitrust expertise.\n\nAlford was the principal deputy to President Trump's hand-picked antitrust chief, Gail Slater. Rinner, a deputy assistant attorney general, headed up merger enforcement.\n\n\"Those are two of the most important deputy assistant attorney general positions,\" former DOJ Antitrust Division attorney William Vigen of Venable said, \"and they are key advisors to the Assistant Attorney General.\"\n\n'A bit schizophrenic': The US Department of Justice headquarters in Washington, D.C. (Reuters/Andrew Kelly/File Photo) · Reuters / Reuters\n\nBoston College antitrust law professor David Olson described the new uncertainty surrounding the administration's antitrust policy as \"a bit schizophrenic.\"\n\nPaul Steidler, a fellow with the conservative-leaning Arlington, Va.-based think tank Lexington Institute, said it's difficult to gauge if the DOJ changes mean that enforcement policy has softened.\n\n\"I think it's erratic. I think it's unpredictable,\" he said, possibly in part because the administration is new. Steidler called the terminations \"troubling\" and \"confusing,\" especially given that the White House has offered no official reason for the decisions.\n\nMerger challenges like the one against HPE — filed roughly a week after Trump took office — appeared to signal the administration's plans to vigorously pursue competition concerns. Further underscoring its offensive approach, the administration pushed ahead with antitrust prosecutions targeting the biggest names in tech, including Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META).\n\n\"So early on, it seemed there would be a lot of continuity from the Biden Administration's antitrust enforcement to the Trump Administration,\" Olson said. \"But this pro-enforcement approach is facing headwinds.\"", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:03:47.537141+00:00"}
