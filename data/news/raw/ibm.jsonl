The company is targeting the rollout of a 4×9-qubit chiplet system in the near term and aims to exceed 100 qubits with 99.5%–99.7% median two-qubit fidelities by year-end. These milestones align with DARPA’s performance criteria as it narrows participants in its Quantum Benchmarking Initiative, a multi-year program to develop utility-scale systems with over 10,000 qubits. Achieving them could secure Rigetti’s place in the next phase and open the door to larger government contracts.\n\nTo support this plan, Rigetti has strengthened its operational base. In February, a $35 million investment from Quanta Computer brings both funding and manufacturing expertise, with Quanta set to produce much of the non-QPU hardware, such as control systems and refrigeration, thus allowing Rigetti to focus on chiplet design and integration. Meanwhile, projects like the AFOSR-backed ABAA fabrication program and Innovate UK partnerships, including a planned 36-qubit upgrade at the NQCC, aim to enhance chip quality and scalability. Key milestones for investors to watch in the remainder of 2025 include the upcoming 4×9 chiplet demonstration, DARPA’s Phase B decision, and progress in Quanta’s production.\n\nPeers Updates\n\nInternational Business Machines IBM has continued to advance its superconducting quantum roadmap, showcasing the 1,121-qubit Condor processor and outlining a path toward modular quantum systems.

Plenty of other companies are using AI to great effect, but they don't get the same level of attention.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM -0.65%) is killing it in AI, and it's a real shame many investors haven't caught on. IBM's AI strategy is focused on providing solutions to its enterprise clients. The company isn't plowing mountains of capital into AI data centers, and it isn't splurging on training industry-leading models. Instead, through a mix of consulting services, software, and hardware, IBM is emerging as a leader in enterprise AI.\n\n$7.5 billion and counting\n\nSince IBM kicked off its generative AI strategy, the company has booked more than $7.5 billion worth of business. Around 80% of this total comes from the consulting business, with the rest coming from software. Playing a supporting role is hardware, namely IBM's decades-old mainframe business.\n\nIBM's consulting-forward strategy works because enterprise clients need more than software. IBM's watsonx platform provides the software tools necessary for clients to develop, fine-tune, deploy, and govern AI agents and applications, but implementation services and other offerings from the consulting business are equally important. A client who uses AWS and Azure for cloud computing may want to deploy watsonx on those platforms, for example, requiring a complex solution that IBM can provide.\n\nIBM does train its own AI models, but the focus is on speed, safety, and cost. IBM's Granite family of models are designed to be fine-tunable for specific tasks. They're open source, perform well in safety benchmarks, and are cost-effective for businesses. In terms of performance, Granite beats competing AI models of similar complexity in a variety of benchmarks.\n\nIBM's mainframe business shouldn't be ignored. Major industries including financial services still depend heavily on IBM's mainframe systems, and the latest z17 model brings some serious AI firepower. The z17 is designed for more than 250 distinct AI use cases, ranging from loan risk mitigation to medical image analysis, and it can handle 450 billion AI inferencing operations per day with response times of one millisecond. For enterprises needing real-time AI inferencing and rock-solid reliability, IBM's mainframes continue to be the best option.\n\nImportantly, IBM's AI strategy doesn't depend on AI technology making exponential gains in capabilities, or on ever-increasing AI infrastructure investments. Because IBM is focusing on delivering AI solutions that help companies reduce costs or boost efficiency, demand should hold up even if the AI frenzy cools off. As it stands today, AI is incredibly useful for businesses, and IBM is playing a critical role in enabling enterprises to tap into the technology.\n\nSurging free cash flow\n\nAfter a decade of uninspiring results and inconsistent revenue growth, IBM has settled into a groove. The company has shed slow-growing businesses and bet on its hybrid cloud computing and AI platforms. Revenue is not only growing again but accelerating, and profits are improving.\n\nFor 2025, IBM expects revenue at constant currency to grow by at least 5%. That may not seem all that quick, but IBM is still a sprawling company with numerous product and service offerings, and it's currently facing a slowdown in demand for discretionary tech projects. Some parts of IBM are growing slowly, and some, like AI, are growing much faster.\n\nIBM also expects to generate more than $13.5 billion in free cash flow this year, up from $12.7 billion in 2024. That's solid growth, particularly given the unpredictable economic developments so far in 2025. Strong growth for IBM's high-margin software business, its largest segment, is helping the cause. Software revenue grew by 8% in the second quarter and managed a segment operating profit margin of 31.1%.\n\nWith solid profits, a return to reliable revenue growth, and an AI strategy that's working well with its enterprise client base, IBM is an AI stock that all investors should seriously consider.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:50:44.723810+00:00"}

However, quantum computing is now promising to be the next paradigm-shifting technology. This transformative technology aims to reshape computational capabilities across every industry.\n\nDespite the high future growth potential, monetization opportunities in quantum computing are still limited. Therefore, it makes sense for investors to select companies involved in quantum computing that are already generating revenue and profits. Here are three top-notch companies that can give investors exposure to the quantum computing revolution with limited risk.\n\nNvidia\n\nSemiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) is the undisputed leader in accelerated computing. Thanks to its critical role in building the global AI infrastructure (hardware and software), the company is generating massive cash flows. This, in turn, allowed it to invest in technologies like quantum computing.\n\nNvidia is not building quantum computing chips directly. Instead, it announced the launch of Nvidia DGX Quantum, the first GPU-accelerated quantum computing system globally. The system is powered by Nvidia's advanced Grace Hopper Superchip (CPU+GPU) and open-source CUDA Quantum programming model.\n\nNvidia is providing the essential software and hardware infrastructure that quantum developers require today. Hence, Nvidia plans to start generating revenue even though the quantum industry has not yet matured.\n\nNvidia has already formed partnerships with companies including IQM Quantum Computers, Pasqal, Honeywell subsidiary Quantinuum, Quantum Brilliance, and Xanadu. These deals allow software developers to work effectively with quantum hardware through Nvidia's platform.\n\nUnlike pure quantum start-ups struggling financially, Nvidia boasts strong profitability. The company generated $60.8 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2025 (ending Jan. 26). Nvidia's revenue surged 69% year over year to $44.1 billion, while net income was up 26% year over year to $18.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending April 27). This financial strength enables the company to invest in new opportunities without risking the core business.\n\nTrading at almost 36 times forward earnings, Nvidia commands a premium valuation. However, as the company provides essential tools that every quantum company needs rather than developing specific quantum hardware, its stock is positioned to grow even higher in the coming years.\n\nInternational Business Machines\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), or IBM, quietly transformed itself from a legacy technology company to a major enterprise AI player that generates revenue through enterprise software sales, consulting services, infrastructure systems, and cloud-based solutions. The company has also been making inroads in the quantum computing space since the 1980s. However, it is only in the past few years that its quantum investments have begun delivering tangible results.\n\nIBM's launch of the 127-qubit Eagle processor in 2021 and the recent deployment of its Quantum System Two in Japan are significant milestones in the company's quantum strategy. The company offers quantum computing capabilities through the IBM Cloud and is powered by its quantum software stack called Qiskit. Qiskit is already the most popular software platform for quantum programming. Through the IBM Quantum Network, over 250 organizations collaborate on practical quantum applications. Since the launch of the quantum business in 2017, the company earned cumulative revenue of around $1 billion from quantum computing initiatives.\n\nUnlike smaller quantum start-ups, IBM has a cash-generating and profitable core business. The company made rapid progress in the enterprise AI segment, as is evident from its generative AI book of business worth $7.5 billion from inception to date. With free-cash-flow guidance of over $13.5 billion for 2025, IBM has sufficient financial flexibility to build quantum capabilities. Yet the company is committed to returning capital and boasts a dividend yield of around 2.69%.\n\nHence, although quantum represents a growing but still modest portion of IBM's business, the technology can prove to be a significant growth catalyst in the long run.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nTechnology giant Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) is also at the forefront of the emerging quantum computing technology. The company's recent breakthroughs, including creating 24 advanced quantum bits with partner Atom Computing and unveiling the Majorana 1 quantum processor in February 2025, demonstrate its quantum computing leadership.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure Quantum service offers customers cloud-based quantum compute capabilities. The service provides clients access to quantum hardware, quantum software, and quantum services for running quantum programs on real quantum hardware, simulating quantum algorithms, and estimating resources needed to scale quantum programs. Even CEO Satya Nadella recently pointed out that \"The next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum.\"\n\nAzure Quantum offers quantum hardware from various third-party providers such as IonQ, Quantinuum, Pasqal, and Rigetti Computing. Microsoft and Atom Computing have planned to ship commercial quantum computers in 2025, featuring over 1,000 physical qubits (unlike regular binary bits used in traditional computing, which can be expressed either as 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously), thereby starting to monetize its quantum technology. Microsoft achieved the first operational deployment of a Level 2 Quantum computer with Atom Computing in July 2025, marking significant progress toward commercial viability.\n\nMicrosoft is integrating quantum computing with AI to deliver a decisive competitive advantage. In January 2025, the company launched its Quantum Ready program to help businesses prepare for quantum transformation.\n\nIts Azure cloud computing business generated more than $75 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, up 34% year over year. Microsoft's revenue also surged 15% year over year to $281.7 billion, while free cash flow was $71.6 billion in fiscal 2025, which ended June 30. Hence, it is clear that Microsoft has sufficient financial strength to support its quantum ambitions without straining resources.\n\nConsidering all the factors, Microsoft offers a low-risk way of investing in the quantum computing opportunity.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:50:54.211487+00:00"}

And since WM is the U.S. leader, it has the size needed to take market share through organic growth and acquisitions.\n\nThe company is steadily growing its operating margins and free cash flow, which is a sign that the business continues to get better. In the second quarter, it reported a 29.9% total company margin under adjusted operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA); 7.1% growth in its legacy business, and 19% overall revenue growth factoring in its acquisition of Stericycle.\n\nThe Stericycle deal was completed in November 2024, giving WM a play on the growing healthcare waste market, which is more specialized than general residential, commercial, or industrial waste services. The $7.2 billion deal follows up the $4.6 billion acquisition of Advanced Disposal in October 2020, which expanded the company's geographic coverage in the eastern half of the U.S.\n\nAt 29.9 times forward earnings, WM is far from a cheap stock. It's actually fairly expensive. But it backs up its premium valuation with stable free cash flow that it uses to grow its dividend, repurchase stock, and reinvest in the business.\n\nThe company has 22 consecutive years of raising its dividend. Despite many sizable dividend increases (the most recent being a 10% bump), the stock only yields 1.5% due to its outperforming stock price.\n\nWM's dividend is highly affordable. It costs the company about $669 million per quarter or $2.676 billion per year, but it plans to earn $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion in 2025 free cash flow.\n\nAdd it all up, and WM stands out as an ultra-high-quality dividend stock that is best suited for investors not looking to maximize their passive income, but rather to collect a dividend as the cherry on top of a strong underlying growth story.\n\nWith ample AI exposure, IBM is over a century old but still qualifies as a growth stock\n\nScott Levine (International Business Machines): I know, I know: It's hard to look at a company like IBM that was incorporated in 1911 and characterize it as a growth stock, but considering its strong exposure to AI, the potential for outsize growth in the coming years is exactly something that's within the realm of possibility for Big Blue.\n\nAdd to this the fact that the stock offers an attractive 2.6% forward-yielding dividend, and it emerges as a great opportunity to sit back and get paid for doing nothing while the AI market evolves.\n\nOf the many achievements that IBM celebrated when it reported second-quarter 2025 financial results recently, one of the most notable is the company's strong generative-AI book of business -- more or less a running total of active contracts and orders it has secured -- that represented $7.5 billion from its inception in 2023 to date.\n\nFor another perspective on how robust its AI exposure is, consider the fact that, according to research from The Motley Fool, the company has the most generative AI patents among American companies.\n\nFrom watsonx, a suite of AI tools that help customers manage data, to Red Hat, which offers generative AI and predictive AI tools, IBM provides customers with a sophisticated set of AI applications that is expected to grow at a steeper rate than previously thought.\n\nAs for the dividend, IBM's five-year average payout ratio of 156% may set off alarm bells for some, but after taking a breath and recognizing how the company's strong free cash flow more than covers it, investors will find their concerns assuaged.\n\nFor those interested in bolstering their AI exposure with a rock-solid dividend play, IBM is a great option right now.\n\nA long-term growth story with a dividend in tow\n\nLee Samaha (Delta Air Lines): I have two surprises for you in this section. First, Delta Air Lines pays a dividend (current yield: 1.4%), and second, it's a genuine contender for a place in the growth end of a balanced portfolio.\n\nThe first point might surprise you because airlines are seen as being highly cyclical businesses whose earnings collapse in a slump (making sustaining a consistent dividend challenging). Still, the reality is that the industry is changing, and Delta's focus on growing more-sustainable premium cabin revenue, combined with its loyalty programs and remuneration from co-brand credit cards with American Express, is reducing its earnings cyclicality.\n\nThe second might also be surprising because, again, Delta is traditionally seen as a cyclical stock, not a growth stock per se. That assumption remains true; however, the argument here is that the long-term trend line -- that growth oscillates about -- is heading upward for Delta for the reasons outlined above.\n\nAnd network operators like Delta are in a favorable position to deal with rising airport costs because they account for a smaller portion of their business compared to, say, a low-cost carrier. Furthermore, airlines are behaving in a much more disciplined manner than they historically have. It all adds up to make Delta an attractive stock for growth investors.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:50:57.617743+00:00"}

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Matt Frankel. I'm joined by my fellow longtime analyst Jon Quast, as well as the Motley Fools co founder and CEO Tom Gardner. Later in the show, we're going to be joined by fool.com analyst Jonathan Wilder. Today we're going to look at some recent earnings from Tesla, Chipotle, Alphabet, service now in IBM, and a little bit later, we are going to look at the Figma IPO that is coming up real soon. First, we're going to put Tesla's results under the microscope. It wasn't a big surprise, but Tesla reported a really weak second quarter. Automotive revenue was down 16% every year. The company has been losing EV market share to traditional automakers like GM. Some will say that Tesla's long term thesis is about a whole lot more than vehicle sales. Jon, what are your thoughts on this?\n\nJon Quast: Look Matt, I think if you're buying Tesla's stock today, you're not buying for the next year, you are looking for the next decade. Look, the report, it's shocking to see its primary revenue generator. Cars have a 16% drop. For any other company, this would be all out panic, but a lot of people say this is just vehicle sales for Tesla. First and foremost of those would be CEO Elon Musk. He says, on the earning call, everything with this business comes down to one word and that's autonomy. The idea is this company will make far more money in the future with its self driving software, with its robot taxis, with its optimist robot. All that is autonomy and that's really the thesis that Tesla Bowles and the CEO Elon Musk have for the company.\n\nMatt Frankel: Direct question here. Do you think Tesla's a buy right now?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah. As you're looking at it, if you're thinking through this grid of autonomy, if you're thinking through the grid of cars, then there's trouble right now. If you're thinking through the grid of autonomy, you really just have to extend that viewpoint way out because this isn't going to happen right away. Musk said that he's eyeing robot taxis for half the US population by the end of this year. But keywords there include probably and pending approval. Spoiler alert I'm almost positive there won't be that much regulatory approval by the end of the year. When it comes to optimist robot, look, they're trying to scale that up, but they're still working on the prototype Number 3 this year and hoping to get that done before the end of the year. I think that you're looking not at 2025 when it comes to Tesla, you need to be thinking 2035 if you're buying into this concept of autonomy today.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, I'd like to get your opinion on this. One of the key quotes that stood out to me from the earnings release was from Elon Musk. He said, we could probably have a few rough quarters, specifically referencing tariffs and the EB tax credits expiring. There's a lot at play here. How do you see the next year or so playing out for Tesla?\n\nTom Gardner: Well, I think it's going to be a bad year by any normal standard for a great growth company. This is not going to be a good year, but Elon Musk and Tesla. Tesla is a lot more than Elon Musk. I'm not meaning to diminish the huge impact he has on the business, but this is a massive company now and we have to understand that the really great companies aren't thinking about the next year. Jeff Bezos talked about this all the time at Amazon. Sometimes as analysts, we get really focused on what does this quarter look like? What's happening with the next 12 months for this business? But great business leaders are really looking forward much farther than that, we have to remember that in the backdrop for Tesla, they have $30 billion cash in net cash on their balance sheet. They have so much more capital, such a stronger balance sheet than anyone in automobiles. Musk's bet here, Tesla's bet is that we are moving to autonomy. It might take longer, there might be some issues in regulatory process on autonomous driving, but robot taxis are live and awesome. We see it with Waymo. We see a lot of high customer satisfaction, willingness to pay more. Obviously, there's not tipping going on, so you can pay a little extra, but it's going to be a premium feature. The last thing I'll say in my belief that Tesla will beat the market over the next five years.\n\nI do actually agree and have for a long time with what Musk said on the earnings call which is that he thinks Tesla will be the largest company in the world if autonomy plays out. I don't think that there's much question as whether it's going to play out. We'll see whether he's right about what will happen with Tesla. But remember, in the backdrop the idea is to have a million optimist robots in less than five years. There is, as Jon says, a lot that you're holding onto in belief. Let's see if this really plays out. I will say in hidden gems we've been an island because we're the only thing in the Motley Fool recommending the stock since 2012 with over 60 recommendations. The first one at about $2 a share. It's played out very well for us, but you cannot own the stock if a 30-50% decline in the price of the shares is going to knock you out because there's just no way you're going to avoid that. This stock will be down 40-60% multiple times. Every two or three years, you should expect a 30-40% decline in stock, in my opinion, and those have been and I believe will continue to be great opportunities to add.\n\nMatt Frankel: Let's pivot to Chipotle's earnings real quick. Unlike Tesla, investors are not that excited about what happened. They gave investors a not so pleasant surprise. They lowered their same store sales guidance for the year, same store traffic declined by 5% year over year. Tom, I know you follow Chipotle pretty closely as well. Is the week's second quarter something investors should really be worried about?\n\nTom Gardner: Not the quarter in itself, Matt, as we discussed with long term thinking for a business like Tesla. However, I'm on the record and my conviction is that, for example, Starbucks will be a better stock over the next five years than Chipotle. Part of that is just straight up Brian Nichol, the CEO who left Chipotle and is now at Starbucks. Is Brian Nichol closer to Michael Jordan, hoops fans know that Chicago Bulls won six NBA championships in eight years. Then when Jordan left in 1998 they have never been back into the championship series again. Sometimes you have an extraordinary leader and I think that is the case with Brian Nichol. My fear for Chipotle is that they're going to lose premium positioning now. We see flattening out same store sales growth. Restaurant margins in decline and obviously in this economic environment, which I think will persist because of a lot of the changes in the technology landscape and what will happen with employment, consumers are looking for discounts and getting lower priced protein in the form of chicken. Chipotle has has a billion and a half in cash flow. This is not a company in trouble at all. My fear is that it will become more of an operating company now rather than a vision driven business. That makes me think that this will be at best a market performer here over the next five years. As I said, I think Starbucks will outperform Chipotle with Brian Nichol as Starbucks a CEO.\n\nMatt Frankel: It's really important to put the quarter into context. Jon, just to name a few things. We got the initial tariff announcements at the start of the second quarter, stocks briefly plunged into a bear market. Consumers started becoming really cautious about discretionary spending, especially when that was going on. What are your thoughts on Chipotle as we head into the second half of the year?\n\nJon Quast: Look Matt, this is anecdotal, but I don't know personally, a single person who saw a tariff announcement on the news and said, Honey, maybe we should skip our Chipotle order this week. I would say that Chipotle is getting more pushback from other things. As Tom mentioned a minute ago, perhaps there's even a perception on value and portion sizes. This did actually come up last year with the company and they had to address it head on. It takes time to change a consumer perception of the business, whether it's real or it's just perceived, it takes time. I think we're still seeing that play out with the traffic being down, they didn't take any pricing. They've been taking pricing in recent years and getting to this point where I think consumers are reaching their limit. That is playing against them right now. I think that is what's happening rather than tariffs being something that are influencing consumers.\n\nLook I think that long term, I also agree with Tom that I think this is a company that is still fantastic operationally. Even with a rough quarter, you're looking at 18% operating profit margins. I know restaurants that would be happy with half of that. Long term, I think this still a company with a lot of promise, it's going to add many new restaurants in coming years. It's going to generate a lot of cash flow. I would agree though, is this going to become more of an operating thing? I'm not really sure that the unit economics are going to recover fully this year. It's going to take time to win back some consumers that have been lost.\n\nMatt Frankel: Next up, we're going to take a look at Alphabet's quarter, and it was a strong one. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nMALE_1: Does it ever feel like you're a marketing professional just speaking into the void? Well, with LinkedIn ads, you can know you're reaching the right decision makers.

Terms and conditions apply.\n\nMatt Frankel: Another one that just reported. Alphabet just reported really impressive results throughout its business. This is the Google parent company, of course. Google Cloud revenue was an extremely strong point with 32% revenue growth. That was an acceleration in the second quarter. Really, one of the biggest takeaways that I got from the report is that the AI investments they're making seem to be working, and management now expects to spend $85 billion in CapEx this year, primarily on building data centers and AI infrastructure up from the previous estimate of 75 billion. I'd love to get the thoughts from both of you but Jon, we'll start with you. What are your thoughts on the quarter and this aggressive AI investment strategy?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah, we human beings are so bad when it comes to big numbers like this. You said it just so casually and so many people are. But let's stop for a second. They raised their capital expenditure guidance by $10 billion. With this money you could buy Campbell Soup Company, 150-year-old business with products in every store across the United States. They could buy Huntington Engles. This is one of the only companies capable of building a nuclear powered aircraft carrier. That's just the amount that they raised the guidance by 10 billion. If you're talking 85 billion now, that's bigger than the GDP of Croatia, Sri Lanka, Panama. That is what they're spending this year on capital expenditures, and that's just one company in one year. This AI trend is unbelievable. When you look at the spending ratcheting up like that, I get really excited thinking about who is on the receiving end of those dollars. There's going to be spending on the GPUs. There's going to be spending on data centers. Power needs are going to be going up. There are so many ways that this can trickle throughout the economy that gets me really excited.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, all this AI spending could be worth it if they're getting a return and it looks like so far they are. What are your thoughts on just this general trend toward billions and billions of dollars being pumped into the AI infrastructure right now?\n\nTom Gardner: Yeah, the first thing is that the reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated. They've been making transitions in their search with Gemini. I'll talk about that in a second, but the business is fundamentally on very solid footing and now they are succeeding and utilizing that AI in profitable ways and breakthrough ways in their overall ecosystem. Google is a Cloud and AI story, and companies that aren't in the Cloud today and aren't accelerating AI every single day are going to be in deep, deep trouble and it's going to come a lot faster than people think. On the Cloud front, Google Cloud is taking market share now from AWS. Their revenue run rate for Google Cloud is $50 billion. Their operating margins raised up to 20% this quarter. Google Cloud is vibrant and a force for the company. On the AI front, Google's scaling Gemini across all those search. Search is essentially becoming a private label brand for Google now, like Kirkland at Costco or 365 at Whole Foods. The private label brand search, 60% of all searches are being resolved without any user click. Think about that. The Gemini feature where you're getting that AI expression when you search something on a mobile screen takes up 75% of screen space. Google is all in on Cloud and AI, and one of the ironies I see with that $85 billion CapEx and one of the things I see about that increase of 10 billion, as Jon said, up to $85 billion in CapEx is also a company that will be working people out of jobs at Google. What that is telling us is that this automation is real. It is significant. People who are investing in AI companies, but not using AI in their everyday life and at their companies are going to fall so far behind so quickly now.\n\nGoogle is just one of the many large technology companies that are demonstrating. This is real. This is enormous. We're betting our entire company to make sure that we're in leadership position in our category. For Google shareholders, thank heavens for that because if Google had fallen behind further, it would be harder and harder for them to catch up both on the Cloudfront and in terms of AI applications. The one caution I have for Google shareholders is just anti competitive practices and whether the regulators are going to get involved with that Gemini search now. Because Gemini search is saving them. They may be a decline in search coming to the Google platform because you can get so much right off Chat GPT or Cloud, Grok, etc, perplexity. But that Gemini application is bringing more and more revenue into search for Google. They're actually on solid footing with their search and the business is on solid footing and if they don't run into regulators, I think you've got a double digit market outperformer in Google from here.\n\nMatt Frankel: Tom, speaking of AI investment, service now I know that's a company you follow. They just posted a really strong second quarter. That was in my opinion, the strongest earnings report as far as the surprise of all the ones we're talking about. I believe their CEO would agree with you. Bill McDermott said in the earnings release, every business process in every industry is being refactored for agentic AI. Even after today's upward move, the stock's still down in 2025. For one, I'm pretty sure you agree with their CEO, but two, what do you make of their future growth prospects now?\n\nTom Gardner: Well, I think the growth prospects are bright for service now. They have excellent underlying financials. You see 30% operating margins just about just short of that, 98% renewal rates among their customers. This is a fantastic business being run quite successfully. I do agree, as you mentioned and mentioned from Bill McDermott, that AI is the new UI that all future product development is coming through AI, fundamentally, all B to C experiences, all consumer experiences and dig will be on AI applications. The one question I have as a service now shareholder ourselves at the Motley Fool is the company has a $200 billion market cap. I think it can outperform the market, but we see those great earnings leading to a marginal increase in the stock today and that's partially just because it's such a richly valued company. A lot of element areas of the market are richly priced right now. I just be patient. Every time you get a chance to buy service now when it's down 10 or 15%, I take advantage of that, and I think you'll be rewarded with profitable investments.\n\nMatt Frankel: Next up, we're going to take a look at IBM's earnings real quick and Figma's upcoming IPO. I'm excited to talk about that.\n\nMALE_1: LD super six fruit and veg comes with a freshness guarantee from just 29 peach red grape fruit, spring onions, pinkeds, apples, and mixed peppers, plus British Jersey roll potatoes and cherries, and the cherry on top. Amazing LD value in store now. LD which cheapest supermarket 2024. Products and prices may vary subject to availability.\n\nMatt Frankel: Jon, IBM shares are down after earnings despite beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The key reason seems to be that the management team is really cautious right now. The CEO said some clients are being cautious due to trade tensions, US federal spending is down, and there are a few other reasons. What are your thoughts on IBM's quarter and is the stock a buy right now?\n\nJon Quast: Yeah, I was surprised that the stock was down after looking over the numbers. Most of the metrics were up and above expectations. Of course, we should keep in mind that with the drop it's still outperforming the S&P 500 over the last year and year to date so context matters I think. But look when it comes to IBM, I think it's really easy to dismiss it from the artificial intelligence conversation because it's such an old business. It doesn't scream AI to me, but all these businesses out there right now are trying to figure out how do use AI in our company and many of them don't know how to do that. That means that they need consulting. It turns out that IBM is pretty good at this. CEO Arvin Krishna said it's book of business for generative AI is now at 7.5 billion and accelerating. Essentially, companies are coming to IBM and looking to how do we integrate AI into what we're doing. That means that they're really actually pretty well positioned and probably better positioned than a lot of investors give them credit for.\n\nNow, granted, IBM only expects about 5% revenue growth this year. Usually when I'm looking at a tech stock to buy, I want to see a little bit better growth in this. That said, over the last couple of years I've just had this growing conviction that IBM is better positioned than people give them credit for. For me, it is a stock to watch.\n\nMatt Frankel: Well, maybe Warren Buffet shouldn't have sold it when he did. Now let's get to the story that I've been really looking forward to. We're going to talk about Figma's IPO. Jonathan, I want to bring you in on this. We're starting to see a resurgence in IPO activity and one big, highly anticipated IPO that's about to go public is Figma. Before we dive in, can you just give us a 32nd description of what Figma does?\n\nJonathan Wilder: Figma is essentially a Google Docs, essentially for UIUX, it allows collaboration between multiple designers to create rapid prototypes which can then be put into the prototype present feedback and iterate loop, which most corporations use to develop new products. That's essentially what they do.\n\nMatt Frankel: Talking to you before the show, I think it would be fair to say, maybe this is an understatement that you're not entirely bullish on the growth story here. Can you tell us why you're approaching Figma with so much caution?\n\nJonathan Wilder: First came out in 2012. They are very much, in my view attached to a an older way of developing products, which again, going back to that is very much the prototype present feedback and iterate. That process can take days, weeks or even months in a typical corporation. With generative AI, that can go down to literally 30 minutes. Instead of getting one prototype back from a design team, you're getting 5-10 prototypes back in less than a day. That alone is a huge disruption for Figma. It's a huge disruption for Adobe and any companies in this space. That's my major. Actually, one example is Galileo is a generative AI competitor to Figma. They were just purchased by Google about a month and a half ago, renamed Stitch and made available completely for free. If you're taking a look at a $75 seat license for FIGMA, you now have an option just to use Google Stitch for free. If I come from a start-up background, and if I raised $5 million at a $20 million valuation, I have the option, should I hire a FIGMA expert for 140 or $150,000 a year or should I just hire AI bots in the form of Stitch, Galileo, and some other versions of AI versions of a Figma and save myself a huge amount of money. I think currently, large corporations are the ones that are stuck on Figma. However as a good example is the Parsons School of Design in New York City are actively now beginning to teach generative AI design. The new designers that are coming out, the younger designers that are entering the workforce, the first tools that they're going toward are generative AI tools. They do not go to Figma. They do not go to Photoshop, even at this point. That's my main thesis, where I'm not too bullish on it.\n\nJon Quast: Jonathan, I think a lot of investors would be reading over the S1 when it comes to Figma and looking at that 46% year over year revenue growth. I think there's a sense that the generative AI trend is already mature. How do we take what you've just shared about the business and maybe some of the risks. But then also how do we counterbalance that with the 46% revenue growth that we see?\n\nJonathan Wilder: Generative AI really started in 2018, 2019 with the transformer architecture. That was first released for the public with Chat GPT in late 2022. However, the generative AI scope of what it's covering it first started to attack coding, the models are continuously being evolved. It then started doing things with the Chat GPT of image generation, runway with video generation, and this area of rapid prototyping is something that is not necessarily a focus of generative AI because if you use something like a cursor or a wind surf you can actually bypass Figma completely because as you're building a design using one of those tools or a bolt is you can ask with very specific prompts to build the design. It will also build the code at the background and will also deploy the code and the design live to a hosting environment. You're talking about Google earlier, Google's doing a very good job of integrating all of these types of tools, and that's why they purchased Stitch, where once you create a design on Stitch, which you would have done previously in FIGMA, now it's already creating the code.\n\nWith one click, it's in Google Colab, which is their development environment and another click, it's in Google Cloud. FIGMA does not have any of that type of functionality built in. The pace of how that's going to evolve is, I would say, exponential over the next year. Most of what Figma has put on in terms of generative AI, I see mostly as band aids, marketing hype. It's unclear what they'll do over the next year. They can turn it around and put really useful generative AI tools within their interface which hasn't changed a huge amount, really in the past decade. Those [MUSIC] are my major concerns.\n\nMatt Frankel: Thanks Jonathan, for that clarity on Figma. It will be really interesting to watch once that one goes public next week.

The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 1.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIBM is expected to post earnings of $2.43 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%.

Today's largest AI models require clusters of powerful data center graphics processing units (GPUs). While AI is capable of solving many types of problems and answering many types of questions, the technology can still get things wrong and go off the rails.\n\nSome of the limitations of current AI technology could potentially be overcome with quantum computing. A quantum computer uses the probabilistic properties of quantum bits, or qubits, to exponentially speed up certain types of calculations. While no company has managed to build a commercially viable quantum computer to date, many are working toward that goal.\n\nA quantum pioneer\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM -0.80%) is one of them. IBM has been doing fundamental research on quantum computing for decades and has a roadmap that leads to a large fault-tolerate quantum system by 2029. The company has already generated nearly $1 billion worth of quantum computing-related business and offers access to its fleet of quantum computers to organizations eager to test out the emerging technology.\n\nIBM demonstrated the first computer based on quantum principles in 1998, assembling atoms of hydrogen and chlorine to successfully sort an unordered list of items. Nearly 30 years later, quantum computing is still not useful in the real world, but immense progress has been made. IBM's latest quantum computers top 100 qubits, and the plan is to exceed 1,000 qubits in 2027 and 2,000 qubits in 2033.\n\nIBM has also been actively researching ways to apply quantum computing technology to machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. Back in 2021, the company's researchers developed a quantum algorithm that can deliver an exponential speedup for a certain class of machine learning classification problems.\n\nOnce large-scale, fault-tolerate quantum computers are a reality, the technology could revolutionize various fields, including AI. Training an AI model is a time-consuming, computationally intensive process that involves massive amounts of data. A quantum computer could potentially accelerate the process and lower the costs of AI training. Quantum computing could also speed up AI inference and lead to better results.\n\nEnterprise AI and quantum computing in one package\n\nWhile other tech giants are working on quantum computing and AI technology, IBM's long track record in quantum computing and its successful enterprise AI business will make it a potent force in the quantum AI age.\n\nIBM has booked $7.5 billion worth of business related to generative AI, and much of that comes from the company's consulting arm. IBM's pairing of AI consulting, which covers implementation and other services, and AI software, primarily its watsonx platform, has proven to be a winner among its enterprise clients. A similar story is likely to play out once quantum computing becomes commercially viable.\n\nIBM may not seem like the most cutting-edge tech company, but it's well-positioned in both AI and quantum computing. As quantum computing technology matures and is eventually applied to AI, IBM is almost certain to be in the thick of it.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:51:09.168366+00:00"}

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.37 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nKyndryl Quarterly Revenue\n\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Kyndryl’s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 5.7% annually over the last two years.\n\nKyndryl Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\n\nThis quarter, Kyndryl’s $3.74 billion of revenue was flat year on year, falling short of Wall Street’s estimates. Company management is currently guiding for a 1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\n\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.4% over the next 12 months. While this projection implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n\nSoftware is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it.

Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 3.2% over the last five years. Unprofitable business services companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It’s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\n\nOn the plus side, Kyndryl’s operating margin rose by 11.5 percentage points over the last five years. Still, it will take much more for the company to show consistent profitability.\n\nKyndryl Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nIn Q2, Kyndryl generated an operating margin profit margin of 4%, up 1.5 percentage points year on year. This increase was a welcome development and shows it was more efficient.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nRevenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nKyndryl Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\nKyndryl’s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last two years. This is encouraging and shows it’s at a critical moment in its life.\n\nIn Q2, Kyndryl reported adjusted EPS at $0.37, up from $0.13 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 1.8%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Kyndryl’s full-year EPS of $1.41 to grow 89.1%.\n\nKey Takeaways from Kyndryl’s Q2 Results\n\nIt was encouraging to see Kyndryl beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue slightly missed and its revenue guidance for next quarter fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 13% to $31.92 immediately after reporting.\n\nKyndryl didn’t show it’s best hand this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to buy the stock right now?

While the stock has lost 12.5% over the past two weeks, it could witness a trend reversal as a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session. This could mean that the bulls have been able to counteract the bears to help the stock find support.\n\nWhile the formation of a hammer pattern is a technical indication of nearing a bottom with potential exhaustion of selling pressure, rising optimism among Wall Street analysts about the future earnings of this technology and consulting company is a solid fundamental factor that enhances the prospects of a trend reversal for the stock.\n\n1-month candlestick chart for IBM\n\nUnderstanding Hammer Chart and the Technique to Trade It\n\nThis is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'\n\nIn simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.\n\nWhen it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.\n\nHammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.\n\nLike every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.\n\nHere's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for IBM\n\nAn upward trend in earnings estimate revisions that IBM has been witnessing lately can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nSeismic, a sales enablement software platform used by large go-to-market teams, is closing in on $400 million in annual recurring revenue and has already reached profitability. Behind that highly sought-after mark is an in-sync CFO-chief revenue officer relationship between Evan Goldstein and Hayden Stafford.\n\nGoldstein, who joined Seismic as CFO in 2022 after leadership roles at Genentech and Salesforce, is a first-time finance chief focused on creating what he calls “structured chaos”— supporting innovation while enforcing financial rigor. Stafford, the company’s CRO and an enterprise sales veteran with prior stints at IBM, Salesforce and Microsoft, joined around the same time. Though they didn’t work together directly during their shared time at Salesforce, at Seismic, they’ve built a model for high-growth SaaS leadership that’s based on collaboration, transparency and shared ownership of growth and profitability.\n\n“In many ways, [collaboration with leadership] is like parenting,” Goldstein said. “Disagreements rise to the top, and we have to present a united front. Hayden and I have invested in the relationship, and that’s made us far more effective at managing any tension and keeping the organization moving forward.”\n\nLaying the groundwork\n\nOne of Goldstein’s priorities as CFO was rebuilding Seismic’s finance organization, moving it beyond accounting to become a forward-looking strategic partner. “The culture here was very accounting-driven,” he said. “I’m not knocking accountants, but you need a broader set of skills to really support decision-making at scale.”\n\nHe brought in a new controller, head of FP&A, a procurement lead and a VP of finance to unify the organization and embed it more deeply in go-to-market operations. “FP&A’s role is to be an effective business partner,” Goldstein said. “It’s about using data to help executives make better decisions.”\n\nEvan Goldstein Permission granted by Evan Goldstein\n\nThose decisions include everything from sales capacity modeling and deal structure analysis to headcount forecasting and pricing alignment. “We’ve worked closely with the CRO to structure deals, analyze sales capacity, model headcount and understand what’s driving bookings growth,” Goldstein said.\n\nStafford said the finance team’s integration with sales has made them more than just gatekeepers. “I sell to nobody more than [Goldstein],” Stafford said. “But the way to ‘sell’ a CFO is not to just page in when you need something; that’s the used car salesman mindset. The proper way is relationship selling, establishing trust and building a genuine relationship.”\n\nUpgrading the finance tech stack also played a role in Seismic’s journey to profitability. Goldstein said he implemented Workday Adaptive Planning to help cut forecast turnaround times and introduced Zip to overhaul procurement. “Procurement was the function most on fire when I joined,” he said. “Now it’s seamless, and we’ve seen strong ROI from day one.”\n\nDeveloping alignment where it matters\n\nOne of the most impactful outcomes of the CFO-CRO relationship at Seismic has been a more disciplined approach to revenue operations. This includes commission planning for sales representatives whose deals involve deferred revenue recognition or extended payment terms, where commissions might otherwise be paid well before the company receives the cash. In order to develop this system, both executives say joint ownership is required.\n\nSeismic now uses a standardized commission model, with few exceptions agreed upon by both finance and sales leadership. “Commissions can create a massive waterfall effect if you’re not careful,” Goldstein said.\n\nHayden Stafford Permission granted by Hayden Stafford\n\nThe system was designed collaboratively with sales leadership and built for field alignment and fiscal control. “Evan came in with the law,” Stafford said. “But [Goldstein] is not a ‘no’ CFO. He says no some of the time and yes some of the time. That’s what a good, commercially oriented CFO is like.”\n\n“I think of the CFO and CRO as having two very different lenses,” Stafford added. “The CFO’s world can be black and white — profit, loss, make or miss the plan. The CRO’s can be extremely dynamic and volatile. I’m looking two quarters out. He’s thinking three years out.”\n\nThat difference in horizon often creates tension, but both say that tension is both necessary and productive. “We work hard to resolve issues quickly, keep each other informed and make sure the organization sees that we’re rowing in the same direction,” Goldstein said.\n\nEven during recent market pressure, the company preserved its President’s Club and top-performer rewards, which Stafford said was evidence of Goldstein’s commitment to rewarding sales representatives. “We didn’t cut our top performers' club,” Stafford said. “I never had to defend it. Evan was already and always behind it.”\n\nBuilding for profitability and flexibility\n\nWhile much of Goldstein’s work over the last three years has focused on financial infrastructure, the goal wasn’t just to survive volatility; it was to build a company that could grow on its own terms. “My overarching goal is to create a durable growth company,” he said. “If we build that, the outcome, whether it’s going public, being acquired or taking additional investment, will take care of itself.”\n\n“Sales wants to close deals quickly and more resources in the field. Finance wants predictability, visibility and control. The truth is, you need both.” Evan Goldstein CFO, Seismic\n\nSOX compliance is the last major hurdle before Seismic is IPO-ready, Goldstein said. “That’s a significant investment of time and money,” he said. “But it’s something you can complete in six to 12 months. If we decided to go this year, we could move on it.”\n\nThe long-range planning process brings together Goldstein’s finance and Stafford’s revenue team and requires alignment on long-term strategy with near-term execution. The team refreshes its three-year plan annually, breaks it into quarterly goals and aligns on metrics like rep productivity, customer economics and bookings efficiency.\n\n“Sales wants to close deals quickly and have more resources in the field,” Goldstein said. “Finance wants predictability, visibility and control. The truth is, you need both. That’s why this relationship works.”\n\nFor Goldstein, that balance — between pressure and alignment, growth and discipline — is exactly what defines a successful contemporary CFO. “You want R&D to experiment and try new things,” he said. “But you also need to protect the financial interests of the company. We’ve been able to strike that balance.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:51:21.056556+00:00"}

Breach costs rose in the United States, though, to an average of $10.22 million from an average of $9.36 million.\n\nAccording to the report, driving the overall global cost decrease was faster identification and containment of breaches, “much of it from organizations’ own security and security service teams, with help from AI and automation.”\n\nHowever, a majority (63%) of organizations that suffered an AI breach said they either didn’t have an AI governance policy or were still developing one.

In order to build wealth, you have to have money to invest. The only way to do this is to spend less than you earn, so you can invest the rest.\n\nThis doesn’t mean just investing whatever cash you happen to have left over, however. Saving and investing must be intentional. If you are earning $50,000 but spending as though you earn $40,000, you’ll have money you can put to work by investing.\n\nBuffett believes in spending on things that will last, not on the latest trends.

Cash makes spending more “real,” so you’re more likely to think about whether you need the item than you would if you were using a credit card.\n\nLearn More: Warren Buffett’s Top 4 Tips for Getting Richer\n\nMake Small Investments in Small Companies\n\nThe advantage that small investors have is that they can invest in small companies, which have the potential to become much larger. Someone who made a small investment in a company like Apple or IBM when it first started out is very wealthy now, provided they held on to the investment. Small investments also give you the opportunity to invest in more different companies, reducing the chances that a poor performance by one company would have a significant negative impact on your portfolio.\n\nLook For Value\n\nBuffett has long espoused the advantages of value investing — buying companies that are undervalued by the market and holding onto them until the market catches up. Buffett recommends looking for a “margin of safety,” which is the difference between earnings and fixed costs. If the company’s market capitalization (outstanding shares times share price) is less than its intrinsic value, it has a margin of safety. The larger the margin, the more attractive the stock. Estimating intrinsic value is part science and part art, as you need to account for not only assets, dividends and earnings, but the company’s future prospects.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:51:26.693396+00:00"}

DeLong cited Bloomberg BusinessWeek’s Amanda Mull and her theory about “stochastic uncertainty”—a cocktail of unpredictability around government policies, trade, immigration, and inflation. Companies aren’t firing; instead, they’re just waiting. And many are delaying new hires in anticipation of possible sudden shifts in tariffs, inflation rates, and regulatory environments. The result is a wait-and-see climate where employers, worried about future economic shocks, have selected caution over expansion. The holding pattern hits new entrants to the workforce especially hard.\n\nDeLong has sounded similar warnings of a slowdown for years. He talked to Fortune in 2022 about his theory of the economy starting to sputter from his book Slouching Towards Utopia . In 2025, he wrote, the big story in the jobs market is not actually AI, but something different.\n\n“This risk aversion is particularly damaging for those at the start of their careers, who rely on a steady flow of entry-level openings to get a foot in the door,” he wrote.\n\nThe economist argued that the uncertainty causes companies to delay major decisions—including hiring—in the face of an unpredictable policy environment.\n\nDeLong sounded a prophetic note, writing that “policy uncertainty” over trade, immigration, inflation, and technology has “paralyzed business planning,” leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of hiring freezes. New entrants to the job market are bearing the brunt of the retreat to risk aversion. In other words, the college graduate class of 2025 is really unlucky.\n\nProminent business leaders had also flagged troubling signs in the economy before the July jobs report dropped. IBM Vice Chair and former Trump advisor Gary Cohn went on CNBC a day before the jobs data, noting “warning signs below the surface.” Cohn said he pays close attention to the quits rate in the monthly JOLTS data, arguing that 150,000 fewer quits was an ominous sign of poor economic health.\n\nDeLong, a professor at UC Berkeley and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, argued in a recent essay that the challenges confronting young job-seekers today are primarily driven by widespread policy uncertainty and a sluggish economy—not by the rapid rise of AI tools like ChatGPT or data-crunching robots. DeLong offered his analysis on July 23, roughly 10 days before the July jobs report stunned markets , revealing that the economy has been much weaker than previously thought for several months.\n\nAs recent college graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years, Berkeley economist and voluble Substacker Brad DeLong has a message for those struggling to land their first full-time gig: Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are not to blame. Larger forces are at work.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile overall unemployment in the U.S. remains low, the situation is uniquely difficult for new graduates relative to the rest of the workforce. Citing economists including Paul Krugman, DeLong noted that while the absolute unemployment rate for college graduates isn’t alarming, the gap between graduate unemployment and general unemployment rates is at record highs. In the past, higher education reliably led to lower unemployment, but now recent grads are struggling “by a large margin” compared to previous generations.\n\nAs previously reported by Fortune Intelligence, Goldman Sachs has argued that the college degree “safety premium” is mostly gone. The team, led by Goldman’s chief economist Jan Hatzius, wrote: “Recent data suggests that the labor market for recent college graduates has weakened at a time when the broader labor market has appeared healthy.”\n\nIt also found that since 1997, young workers without a college degree have become much less likely to even look for work, with their participation rate dropping by seven percentage points.\n\nMull cited an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which found that tech and design fields, including computer science, computer engineering, and graphic design, are seeing unemployment rates above 7% for new graduates.\n\nWhy the AI hype misses the mark\n\nAlthough the tech sector is buzzing about AI’s potential to replace junior analysts or automate entry-level tasks, DeLong urged caution in assigning blame. In his typical style, he noted, “there is still [no] hard and not even a semi-convincing soft narrative that ‘AI is to blame’ for entry-level job scarcity.” Hiring slowdowns, he pointed out, are driven by broader economic forces: uncertainty, risk aversion, and changes in how companies invest.\n\nHere again, DeLong’s analysis rhymes and aligns with recent research from Goldman’s Hatzius. The bank’s quarterly “AI Adoption Tracker,” issued in July, found that the unemployment rate for AI-exposed occupations had reconciled with the wider economy, which contradicts fears of mass displacement. They also noted there have been no recent layoff announcements explicitly citing AI as the cause, underscoring that it’s contained to disruption of specific functions, not entire industries.\n\nCrucially, he argued, rather than hiring people, companies in the tech sector are splurging on “the hardware that powers artificial intelligence”—notably Nvidia’s high-performance chips—fueling a boom in capital investment while sidelining junior hires.\n\n“For firms, the calculus is straightforward: Investing in AI infrastructure is seen as a ticket to future competitiveness, while hiring junior staff is a cost that can be postponed.”\n\nUnderpinning these trends is a shift away from any and all risk. Employers prefer to hire for specific short-term needs and are less willing to invest in developing new talent—leaving young applicants caught in a cycle where “just getting your foot in the door” is more difficult than ever. Incumbent workers, worried about job market uncertainty, are less likely to change jobs, leading to fewer openings and greater stagnation.\n\nDeLong’s analysis harmonized with Goldman Sachs’ findings about the declining premium attached with a college degree:\n\n“For the longer-run, the rise in the college wage premium is over, and a decline has (probably) begun.”\n\nFor decades, he continued, a college degree was a ticket to higher earnings, and the labor market rewarded those with advanced skills and credentials. In recent years, though, “this has plateaued and may even be falling.” The causes are complex, he added, but the takeaway: While degrees remain valuable, they are no longer the ever-ascending ticket to prosperity they once were.\n\nThese comments confirm the gloomy remarks of University of Connecticut professor emeritus Peter Turchin, who recently talked with Fortune about the declining status of the upper middle class in 21st century America. When asked where else he sees this manifesting in modern life, Turchin said, “It’s actually everywhere you look.\n\n“Look at the overproduction of university degrees,” he said, arguing that the decreasing premium that Goldman and DeLong write about shows up in declining rates of college enrollment and high rates of recent graduate unemployment. “There is overproduction of university degrees and the value of a university degree actually declines.”\n\nDeLong’s bottom line for recent grads: Blame a risk-averse business climate, not technology, for today’s job woes. And now that we know the economy may have been much more risk-averse in 2025 than previously, DeLong’s warnings are worth revisiting.\n\nDeLong did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

In July 2025, the company unveiled a 36-qubit chiplet-based architecture that achieved 99.5% median two-qubit gate fidelity, effectively halving error rates compared to prior generations. This follows Ankaa-3, which also hit that same fidelity mark, demonstrating consistent progress across both single-chip and modular platforms. With plans to scale this architecture to 100+ qubits by the end of 2025, Rigetti is signaling that its roadmap is not just aspirational but also executable.

Ankaa-2, Rigetti’s 84-qubit system, was made publicly available on Amazon Braket in mid-2024, bringing it out of the lab and into the hands of developers and early adopters. The system delivered 98% median two-qubit fidelity and featured a square-lattice layout designed for better hybrid performance. In partnership with Riverlane, Rigetti also demonstrated real-time quantum error correction on Ankaa-2 with decoding speeds below one microsecond—a critical step toward fault-tolerance.

Available through AWS Braket and its cloud, the system is now accessible to customers around the world. IonQ’s focus on delivering algorithmic performance with strong coherence and fidelity metrics makes it an attractive option for early enterprise experimentation. While the full commercial impact is still developing, IonQ’s ability to put systems in customers hands gives it a more visible path to scaling than peers still in limited-access or pilot stages.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:51:30.346894+00:00"}

Inc. IONQ is slated to report results for the second quarter of 2025 on Aug. 6, after the closing bell.\n\n\n\nIonQ, a pioneer in trapped-ion quantum computing and quantum networking, heads into its second-quarter 2025 earnings report riding high on a string of commercial and strategic achievements. Following a better-than-expected first-quarter 2025, where it posted a revenue of $7.57 million and a bottom line of a loss of 14 cents per share, both topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate, reinforcing its momentum in quantum computing and networking. The company’s revenues were slightly down 0.2% year over year but above the midpoint of its prior guidance. Its bottom line was marked improvement from the prior year’s 19-cent loss per share.\n\n\n\nMarkedly, IonQ reported better-than-expected earnings in two of the trailing four quarters and missed on the other two occasions, the average negative surprise being 52%.\n\nHow Are Estimates Placed for IonQ Stock?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s EPS has remained unchanged at a loss of 13 cents per share over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates improvement from the year-ago loss of 18 cents per share.\n\n\n\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $17.02 million, indicating 49.6% year-over-year growth.\n\n\n\nFor 2025, IONQ is expected to register a 97.3% increase from a year ago in revenues. Its bottom line is expected to witness an improvement to a loss of 60 cents per share from $1.56 a year ago.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat to Expect in Q2 for IonQ: Scaling Revenue and Strategic Execution\n\nIonQ heads into the second quarter of 2025 with significant momentum and a clear pathway to accelerated growth. Management has reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance and set second-quarter revenue expectations in the range of $16 million to $18 million, more than double the $7.57 million posted in the first quarter. This strong sequential growth outlook reflects both organic progress and anticipated contributions from recent strategic moves.\n\n\n\nA major catalyst for second-quarter revenue is the $22 million Forte Enterprise system sale to EPB of Chattanooga, which marks the company’s first commercial customer deployment combining both quantum computing and a live quantum network. This milestone not only underscores IonQ’s ability to monetize its hardware at scale but also introduces a new distributed data center strategy, allowing IonQ to serve customers from multiple quantum hubs, including Tennessee, College Park, and Seattle.\n\n\n\nThe second quarter is also expected to benefit from inorganic revenue streams. IonQ completed its acquisition of ID Quantique on April 30, just before the start of the second quarter, meaning the subsidiary’s performance will begin contributing to the top line. While the Lightsynq and Capella acquisitions, their absorption into IonQ's operations is expected to further enhance the company’s ability to deliver secure quantum communications and scalable interconnects. Both companies bring with them differentiated technologies in quantum memory and space-based quantum networking that align tightly with IonQ’s long-term roadmap.\n\n\n\nFrom a technology standpoint, IonQ is prioritizing the delivery of AQ 64 as a key milestone in 2025. The engineering and performance development of the company’s Tempo system is ongoing and remains on schedule, with teams focused on improving fidelity and achieving targeted performance thresholds. These advancements are crucial as the company aims to transition from proof-of-concept demonstrations to commercially viable quantum compute capacity that can support large-scale enterprise and government applications.\n\n\n\nFinancially, IonQ is preparing for an increase in its cost base during the second quarter, primarily due to the integration of newly acquired businesses and continued investment in headcount and R&D. Management disclosed that it expects a 35% increase in its previously projected adjusted EBITDA loss for the year, highlighting its commitment to growth and long-term value creation over short-term profitability.\n\n\n\nOverall, the second quarter of 2025 is shaping up to be a transformative period for IonQ. The combination of commercial contract execution, international expansion, and integration of next-generation quantum networking capabilities positions the company to significantly scale its operations.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:51:34.029265+00:00"}

He said if you take a “big, wide aperture snapshot of the economy, the headline looks really good,” before arguing that a deeper analysis, even a “half-step back,” reveals important red flags. Notably, he highlighted a 15% drop in investment and concerning labor market statistics, including a significant decline in voluntary quits—a traditional signal of worker confidence in the job market. Cohn cited the latest JOLTS report, which showed 280,000 jobs lost and 150,000 fewer voluntary quits, suggesting Americans are growing more cautious about leaving their jobs for better opportunities. “People quit their job when they believe the next job is better and higher-paying,” he said, calling that a “bold statement on individuals’ view on the economy.”\n\nWho eats the tariffs and who drinks the coffee?\n\n“A snapshot of the economy right now is, ‘we’re fine, we’re good,’” Cohn said, referencing both the strong labor market and inflation measures that have moderated closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. In fact, he argued the Fed is fulfilling its dual mandate of full employment and price stability, as the jobs market looks close to full employment, in his view. However, he warned about softer data such as consumer sentiment and in specific segments of the economy. Cohn noted that several soft retail earnings, such as Starbucks, show that “consumers are not out there willfully spending money.”\n\nOne of the interview’s major themes was the effect of tariffs and trade uncertainty. Cohn, who famously resigned from the Trump White House in 2018, seemingly after internal disagreements over tariffs, argued that tariffs should be applied carefully and strategically. He has clarified in 2024 and onwards that he supports tariffs on products the U.S. also produces, such as electric vehicles, but warned that indiscriminate tariffs risk inflaming inflation, especially on goods the U.S. does not manufacture domestically. Cohn has been saying for months that tariffs are “highly regressive” and essentially function as a tax on all Americans, with a greater impact on poorer people.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:51:39.665204+00:00"}

That information, plus the context of the failed conversation, are sent to a more capable large language model, which determines the user’s intent as well as where the original agent went wrong.\n\nIf possible, the language model hands the task back to the agent, this time with a clarified user intent. If the task is outside of the agent’s capabilities, the language model handles it.\n\n“Traditional (conversational agents) are limited to a specific set of topics and are not able to respond to input outside those topics,” IBM said in the filing. “They can only produce responses that are pre-written or pre-approved by humans, i.e., they are non-generative.”\n\nWhile IBM’s tech uses AI to fix AI, generative models don’t always get things right. The domain knowledge of large language models tends to be far more expansive than that of a simple question-answer chatbot. But when conversation expands outside of the realm of its training data, these models can hallucinate, potentially leading to broader issues than a closed-domain chatbot running out of things to say.\n\nPlus, while AI agents are the current hot topic of the tech world, as far as customer service goes, many consumers prefer the real thing: A Gartner study found that 64% of customers reported they’d prefer that companies not use AI for customer service. About 53% reported that they’d consider switching to a competitor because of it.\n\nThe bottom line: Before using AI to make chatbots better, remember the tech is far from a panacea.

It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect International Business Machines to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On International Business Machines' Profit Performance\n\nUnusual items (expenses) detracted from International Business Machines' earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that International Business Machines' statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction over the last three years. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For example - International Business Machines has 4 warning signs we think you should be aware of.\n\nThis note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of International Business Machines' profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with high insider ownership.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Unlike rivals chasing raw qubit counts, IonQ emphasizes “algorithmic qubits” (AQ), a more meaningful metric of computational usefulness. The company’s 2025 goal is to reach AQ 64, a milestone that would significantly advance practical quantum applications. IonQ is also expanding into quantum networking. Its acquisitions of ID Quantique and Lightsynq strengthen its position in secure communications and quantum repeaters—essential components of a future quantum internet. The recent purchase of Capella Space adds space-based capabilities, supporting IonQ’s ambition to build a global quantum key distribution (QKD) network. This end-to-end platform strategy could set IonQ apart in both commercial and defense markets. Financially, IonQ remains well-funded, with $697 million in cash and investments as of first-quarter 2025. This capital cushion supports its aggressive R&D and acquisitions, though it comes with rising losses. Operating expenses surged as IonQ grew its engineering force and integrated new assets, leading to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $35.8 million, wider than last year’s $27 million. Management now expects a 35% higher full-year EBITDA loss than initially forecast as it accelerates development. Despite these losses, IonQ’s liquidity enables continued investment in technology leadership. Net losses narrowed slightly year over year due to a warrant-related gain, but profitability remains distant. To justify its valuation, IonQ must sustain technical progress and commercial traction. The competitive landscape is intense—tech giants like International Business Machines Corporation IBM, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google, and Amazon AMZN are all pushing quantum R&D. IonQ’s success hinges on proving that its trapped-ion systems can scale effectively. Hitting the AQ 64 target could solidify its edge and validate its approach amid heavyweight rivals.\n\nThe quantum computing race is heating up, and two of the most followed pure-play names in the space— IonQ IONQ and Rigetti Computing RGTI—are competing not just on scientific milestones, but on commercial traction and investor confidence. Both companies are developing hardware-driven platforms with unique architectures. As the quantum sector inches closer to real-world utility, comparing IonQ and Rigetti offers valuable insight into which player may offer more upside in 2025. Though they take different technical paths—IonQ focuses on trapped-ion quantum processors while Rigetti uses superconducting qubits—both aim to scale toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. They also share a commonality in working with government partners such as DARPA and emphasizing next-gen quantum networking. With recent updates from both firms, including acquisitions, new partnerships, and updated roadmaps, it's an opportune moment to evaluate which company is better positioned for growth in the near term. Let’s dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Case for Rigetti Stock\n\nFounded in 2013, Rigetti Computing is advancing superconducting quantum computing with a focus on scalable architecture. Its core innovation lies in a modular “chiplet” design, allowing multiple smaller chips to be linked together instead of relying on a single monolithic processor. This strategy addresses the increasing difficulty of scaling quantum chips. Rigetti is currently developing a four-chip module, aiming for a 36-qubit system by mid-2025 and over 100 qubits by 2025-end, with target gate fidelities above 99%.\n\n\n\nRigetti believes this multi-chip approach is the most feasible path to building large-scale quantum computers. It also argues that other superconducting systems relying on single-chip expansion have faced limitations, and that ion-trap or photonics-based systems lag in terms of qubit count. If Rigetti’s modular system delivers high performance at scale, it could become a leading platform despite current gaps in size and maturity.\n\n\n\nThe company is gaining institutional validation. It was selected for DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative—alongside IBM and HP—positioning it as a credible player in next-generation quantum efforts. In a major commercial win, Rigetti secured a $35 million investment from Quanta Computer, which acquired shares at $11.59 apiece. This partnership could support high-volume manufacturing, a potential future advantage if Rigetti achieves demand-scale breakthroughs.\n\n\n\nFinancially, Rigetti is still in early innings. As of first-quarter 2025, it had $237.7 million in cash, bolstered by Quanta’s investment. However, its revenue remains modest—just $1.47 million in the first quarter, down 52% year over year—and primarily stems from research contracts.\n\n\n\nDespite heavy losses and uncertain revenue growth, Rigetti’s engineering roadmap and industrial alliances provide a possible runway for upside. However, competition in superconducting quantum is intense. Rigetti competes not only with IBM (which has a 433-qubit chip already, albeit with lower fidelity than Rigetti aspires to) and Google, but also with a host of startups and research labs. Unlike IonQ, which has a unique ion-based approach largely to itself in the public markets, Rigetti must differentiate itself among many working on superconducting qubits.\n\n\n\nAt this stage, Rigetti’s strengths are its innovative engineering and strategic alliances, while its weaknesses are the scant revenue and unproven scalability.\n\nShare Price Performance of IONQ and RGTI Stocks\n\nIonQ stock surged 442.8% over the past year amid growing interest in the quantum computing sector. Even after some volatility in 2025, IonQ shares are still up 54.2% over the past three months. Meanwhile, RGTI stock has surged 1,116.4% over the past year and 75.5% over the past three months.\n\n3-Month Share Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation of IONQ & RGTI Stocks\n\nHaving a market capitalization of around $12.3 billion, IonQ stock has been volatile, reflecting the high expectations built into its valuation. IonQ’s forward 12-month price/sales (P/S) ratio is 98.14. The stock’s lofty price-to-sales ratio reflects enormous optimism for future growth, leaving little margin for error.\n\n\n\nWith a market cap near $5 billion, Rigetti’s stock reflects investor excitement but also vulnerability. RGTI’s forward 12-month P/S ratio is 236.36, much higher than IONQ’s. Any sign of delays in the chiplet program or failure to hit the mid-year 36-qubit milestone could shake confidence.\n\nIONQ & RGTI Estimate Revision Trend\n\nFor IONQ, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has widened over the past 30 days to 60 cents, as you can see below, depicting analysts’ concern. Yet, the estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%.\n\nFor IONQ Stock\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor RGTI stock, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share of 5 cents has remained unchanged over the past 30 days, as you can see below, limiting the upside potential of the stock. The estimated figure indicates improvement from the year-ago loss level of 36 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies a year-over-year decline of 18.6%.\n\nFor RGTI Stock\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion: Which Quantum Stock Has the Edge?\n\nBoth IonQ and Rigetti are developing potentially game-changing technology, and both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a balanced risk/reward in the near term. However, when closely comparing the two, IonQ appears to have the edge as an investment in 2025. IonQ boasts a stronger foundation – it is generating significantly more revenue, achieving real commercial deals, and commands a much larger cash reserve to fund its ambitions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n\n\nIonQ’s strategy of coupling quantum computing with quantum networking (via acquisitions and partnerships) also expands its total addressable market and could yield nearer-term revenue streams (for example, selling quantum communication hardware or services) in addition to computing. By contrast, Rigetti is currently focused almost entirely on the long-term prize of a bigger, better quantum processor – an exciting pursuit, but one that may not pay off until further down the road, if at all. Its dependency on delayed government funding and a limited revenue base makes it a more speculative investment at this stage.\n\n\n\nIndeed, Rigetti’s share price has been extraordinarily volatile, rising dramatically in anticipation of its milestones. IonQ’s relative maturity in revenue generation and its broader vision for quantum tech give it a more favorable risk-reward profile at present. IonQ’s healthy balance sheet, aggressive execution on both terrestrial and space-based quantum networking and increasing revenues provide a cushion and confidence to investors that the business is trending in the right direction.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the first quarter of 2025, the company signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with Japan’s G-QuAT and Korea’s Toyota Tsusho and Intellian, targeting quantum computing adoption and quantum networking in space. These alliances mark IonQ’s intent to tap into the Asia-Pacific region’s growing appetite for cutting-edge tech and sovereign digital infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThis international momentum aligns with IonQ’s broader mission to lead both quantum computing and networking. Recent acquisitions—including South Korea’s ID Quantique—are bolstering the firm’s presence in telecom-rich regions like Korea and Singapore, where IonQ now powers commercial quantum networks for SK Telecom and Singtel. The Asia strategy goes beyond mere market access: it integrates research capabilities, military-grade network security, and enterprise applications.\n\n\n\nIonQ’s quantum computing roadmap also benefits. Its acquisition of Lightsynq enables the development of long-distance quantum repeaters—key to building the quantum Internet—while Capella’s capabilities in satellite-based QKD strengthen the company's edge in secure space communications.\n\n\n\nWith geopolitical tensions driving demand for secure, localized quantum systems, IonQ’s Asia outreach and global positioning could unlock significant revenue streams and strategic influence. Backed by nearly $700 million in cash and a strengthened product pipeline, IonQ is not just expanding—it's redefining the quantum landscape.\n\n\n\nThe company expects $16–$18 million in revenues in the second quarter of 2025, and if its Asia partnerships deliver as intended, IonQ may be entering its next chapter of commercial-scale growth.\n\nHow IBM and Rigetti Are Responding to IonQ’s Asia Moves\n\nAs IonQ accelerates its global expansion, competitors like International Business Machines Corporation IBM and Rigetti Computing RGTI are also intensifying efforts to claim their stake in the quantum race. IBM maintains a stronghold with its IBM Quantum Network, which includes partners in Japan and South Korea, directly competing with IonQ’s recent MOUs in those regions. IBM’s focus on superconducting qubits and its aggressive roadmap toward a 100,000-qubit system underscores its long-term ambition to dominate both computing and secure communications.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rigetti is pursuing hybrid quantum-classical systems and recently signed collaborations with international research institutions. Though Rigetti lacks IonQ’s capital strength, it aims to stay relevant through government partnerships and lower-cost access models.\n\n\n\nBoth IBM and Rigetti are watching IonQ’s Asia strategy closely. As IonQ scales through photonic interconnects and distributed networks, IBM and Rigetti must find ways to match its agility, especially in key overseas markets.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:52:10.306129+00:00"}

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for IBM is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor IBM, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

ANET indispensable for any investment portfolio. But before digging deep into these prized possessions, let us delve a little more into why organizations are increasingly adopting cloud computing. Cloud computing eliminates fixed capital expenses pertaining to the purchase of related hardware and software. It reduces the operating costs of maintaining onsite data centers and deploying IT experts to manage the infrastructure, making it highly cost-effective. Based on a pay-per-use pricing model, enterprises only pay for the computing resources they use. With easy access to a plethora of innovative technologies, it increases productivity with greater agility and flexibility, and improves scalability with higher economies of scale. Moreover, cloud computing services are delivered over a highly secure network with low latency for applications and data backup facilities for improved reliability. Cloud computing services fall into four broad categories, namely infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless and software as a service (SaaS), offering different levels of control, flexibility and management options to business enterprises. Cloud computing, relying heavily on virtualization and automation technologies, provides the requisite infrastructure for AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning (ML) workloads. It delivers powerful computing abilities to process and analyze data, creating an ideal platform for Big Data management. Per Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market size is expected to swell to $2,390.2 billion by 2030 from $752.4 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 20.4% with a variety of capabilities across multiple industries. These include better patient monitoring and outcomes in healthcare, personalized financial management and predictive spending, immersive learning in education, superior inventory management in retail and predictive maintenance and better supply chain management in the manufacturing sector.

After declining 10.4% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.\n\nWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.\n\nRSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.\n\nTechnically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.\n\nSo, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefiting from the inevitable rebound.\n\nHowever, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.\n\nWhy IBM Could Bounce Back Before Long\n\nThe RSI reading of 24.98 for IBM is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.\n\nThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term.

The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

Currently, the benchmark S&P 500 index is trading at nearly 29 times its trailing earnings, far higher than its historical median of 17.9 times.\n\nWhile this signals stretched valuations in the market, not all artificial intelligence (AI) stocks joined the frenzy. There are still companies, such as Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) and International Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), that possess cutting-edge AI capabilities, scale, brand name, and solid financials, trading at modest valuations.\n\nHere's why these stocks seem impressive picks in July 2025.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet is one of the few AI powerhouses that surprisingly remained affordable amid the AI-driven technology rally. Currently trading at just 18.7 times forward earnings, the company is significantly cheaper than other technology giants, such as Microsoft, which trades at 32.8 times forward earnings, and Nvidia, which trades at 36 times earnings.\n\nThis discounted valuation appears highly unjustified considering Alphabet's exceptional financial strength and its robust and comprehensive AI ecosystem, which is strengthening its Search business as well as Google Cloud and YouTube.\n\nAlphabet delivered stellar performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending June 30), with revenues and earnings surpassing consensus expectations. The company generated revenues of $96.4 billion, a 14% increase year over year, while net income reached $28.2 billion, representing 19% growth. This performance was mainly driven by the exceptional growth of its AI and cloud business.\n\nAlphabet's AI Overviews (a feature that provides direct answers and summaries at the top of search results) is currently serving over 2 billion users monthly across more than 200 countries and 40 languages. This is helping drive commercial queries for its Search business.\n\nAlphabet's Google Cloud business is also experiencing rapid growth, with deals over $250 million doubling year over year and the company signing the same number of billion-dollar deals in the first half of 2025 as in all of 2024. The recent OpenAI deal to use the Google Cloud platform as an infrastructure provider for its ChatGPT can prove to be a major catalyst in the long run.\n\nYouTube also dominates streaming, with over 200 billion daily views on YouTube Shorts. It's No.1 based on streaming time in the U.S.\n\nAlphabet's Gemini 2.5 Pro \"thinking\" AI model has shown improved performance compared to competitors in several complex tasks at lower costs. This technological edge appears to have driven an 80% surge in usage for the Google AI Studio platform and the Gemini API in April 2025. Nearly 9 million developers have already used the Gemini 2.5 models.\n\nFinally, although the market has become concerned about Alphabet's decision to increase capital spending to $85 billion in 2025 compared to the prior estimate of $75 billion, these strategic AI infrastructure investments will prove beneficial for the company in the long run. The company also boasts a very healthy balance sheet with $95 billion in cash at the end of Q2. It generated $66.7 billion in trailing-12-month free cash flow.\n\nWhile the risks of disruption in the search market from AI browsers cannot be ignored, Alphabet's Q2 results have demonstrated the company's ability to monetize AI successfully. Considering all the factors, Alphabet appears to be a solid pick in 2025.\n\nInternational Business Machines\n\nInternational Business Machines, commonly referred to as IBM, remains a significant enterprise AI player that Wall Street surprisingly overlooked for the past several years. The stock has crashed after an impressive Q2 fiscal 2025 performance likely due to a weaker-than-expected software performance. Trading at 26.5 times forward earnings, the company is also valued at a significant discount compared to technology giants like Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nThe $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat transformed IBM from a legacy technology company into a significant player in the AI and hybrid cloud space. Red Hat business reported a 14% year-over-year revenue jump in Q2. OpenShift, Red Hat's hybrid cloud platform, reported a 20% year-over-year rise in revenues and reached annual recurring revenues (ARRs) of $1.7 billion.\n\nUnlike many technology competitors focusing on the consumer AI segment, IBM is targeting the enterprise AI market, especially in regulated industries and those involving complex hybrid cloud requirements. The company's full-stack AI suite watsonx, which leverages Red Hat's infrastructure, enables secure and compliant AI use in sectors such as finance, banking, and government. The recently announced acquisition of start-up Seek AI will further strengthen the watsonx platform with natural language capabilities.\n\nAll these initiatives have translated into IBM's generative AI book of business now standing at $7.5 billion inception-to-date in Q1, significant growth from $6 billion reported in the previous quarter.\n\nThe overall software business (including Red Hat, automation, data, and transaction processing) reported 8% year-over-year growth in Q2, while annual recurring software revenue reached $22.7 billion, a 10% year-over-year increase. Software now accounts for 45% of IBM's business, with highly recurring revenue streams.\n\nIBM's infrastructure business delivered exceptional results in Q2, with revenues growing 11% year over year. IBM Z (a family of high-performance, mainframe computers for mission-critical workloads) revenues increased 67% year over year in the same period. Demand has been strong for the z17 next-generation mainframe.\n\nConsidering the many tailwinds, the stock can prove to be a worthwhile addition to the investor's portfolio.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:52:23.652930+00:00"}

It is the leading manufacturer of graphic processing units (GPUs) worldwide. However, its gains are far surpassed by Rigetti Computing, Inc.’s RGTI 1147.6% increase during the same period.\n\nYes, the quantum computing company has experienced some volatility this year, but overall, investors remain optimistic about the stock since quantum processing units (QPUs) can process data much faster than GPUs and could potentially be the next major advancement in technology. So, can Rigetti achieve similar success to NVIDIA in the future, and is it a worthwhile investment? Let’s find out –\n\nReasons to Be Bullish on Rigetti Stock\n\nRigetti offers both modular and non-modular QPUs for sale. For developing quantum applications, Rigetti provides cloud-based platforms and designs its own quantum systems. This strategy of diversifying assists the company in minimizing risks.\n\nRigetti has made significant progress in quantum computing and released its first QPUs for commercial use in 2023. Recently, the company introduced the 84-qubit Ankaa 3 quantum system for government, and for commercial clients, it launched the 9-qubit QPU.\n\nLikewise, Rigetti will launch a 36-qubit system this time and a non-modular 100-qubit system in 2026. Currently, it is collaborating with NVIDIA to develop a hybrid system combining QPU and GPU technologies to improve AI task processing efficiency.\n\nRigetti also offers more flexible on-site deployment options and pricing structures, giving it an advantage over larger competitors like International Business Machines Corporation IBM. As a result, many market analysts expect Rigetti’s revenues to grow in the future with the rollout of its new systems.\n\nRigetti envisions a substantial long-term market for quantum computing. Boston Consulting Group estimates the market to be worth between $90 billion and $170 billion, while McKinsey projects it could reach $198 billion by that time.\n\nCould Rigetti Be the Next NVIDIA? Should I Invest Now?\n\nDespite Rigetti showcasing significant growth potential and staying ahead of its competitors, the practical use of quantum computing remains years away, leading to heightened risks and constraining RGTI’s potential for advancement. Hence, it’s premature to conclude that Rigetti will be able to mimic NVIDIA’s success.\n\nNVIDIA, on the other hand, has reclaimed the top spot as the most valuable company, driven by increased demand for AI. The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues of $44.1 billion topped expectations, and are anticipated to see further growth as the demand for Blackwell chips and CUDA software continues to be robust (read more: D-Wave Quantum or NVIDIA: Which Stock Is a Better Buy Now?).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:52:33.346919+00:00"}

Arvind Krishna, the CEO, said that clients were spending more on hardware and that choices were being delayed because of geopolitical concerns and tight U.S. federal budgets.\n\nBoth infrastructure revenue, which rose 14% to $4.14 billion, and consulting revenue, which rose nearly 3% to $5.31 billion, were more than expected. IBM stuck to its prediction of more than $13.5 billion in free cash flow in 2025 and at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency, even though several projects were delayed.\n\nIBM's generative AI business grew from $6 billion in April to $7.5 billion. Krishna stated that when the rules get better, the company hopes to grow even more through mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:52:42.556443+00:00"}

Paychex is on the verge of a growth spurt, with revenue and earnings expected to jump this year.  Tech stocks are incredibly popular investments, and for a good reason.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/25/3-soaring-tech-stocks-with-amazing-dividends/", "published_at": "2025-07-25T07:04:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Tech stocks are incredibly popular investments, and for a good reason. Technology stocks make up roughly one-third of the entire S&P 500 index, which is a measurement of the 500 biggest U.S.-based publicly traded companies. And that sector as a whole is nearly doubling the performance of the broader index so far this year.\n\nThe one argument that people could have against tech stocks is the lack of a dividend. Many tech stocks, because they are on the forefront of innovation, are plowing their profits back into the business. Either they're scaling already successful products, pouring money into research to develop the next big thing, or they are spending millions on graphics processing units (GPUs) to run their artificial intelligence (AI)-based platforms. Often, they're doing all three.\n\nThat leaves no money for a quarterly or monthly dividend payout that income investors love to receive -- either to reinvest into their portfolios to advance their wealth or to pay monthly living expenses as they settle into a comfortable retirement. But with some stocks, you can have it both ways. If you want to invest in tech stocks that will top the market and also pay a great dividend, look no further than Cisco Systems (CSCO 1.00%), International Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), and Paychex (PAYX -2.60%). All three are good buys right now.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nCisco is a well-known provider of networking security solutions, software, and cloud computing. It creates Internet Protocol-based routers and switches that allow information to travel across networks. Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 26, 2025) was $14.1 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.62, up a solid 35% from the same period a year ago.\n\nAI has been a big driver of Cisco products, as the company generated more than $1 billion in AI-related revenue in 2024 and plans to at least double that in 2025. Cisco expanded its revenue stream thanks in part to its acquisition of Splunk, a $28 billion deal that closed last year and was designed to help customers improve their networking, security, and AI capabilities.\n\nCisco is an example of an established technology company that is still finding ways to grow and outperform the market, rising 15% in 2025. On top of that, Cisco stock pays a 2.3% dividend yield.\n\nInternational Business Machines\n\nIf I think about established tech companies, one of the first that comes to mind is stalwart IBM (nicknamed Big Blue). The company traces its roots back more than 100 years. And while IBM is perhaps best known for its work in developing personal computers, today's IBM is more known for its work in cybersecurity, cloud computing, consulting, and its massive mainframe computers that are used by an estimated 81% of all Fortune 500 companies.\n\nDespite its storied history, Big Blue today moves like a spry stock market powerhouse, gaining 30% so far this year. Its 2019 acquisition of Red Hat helped IBM develop a hybrid cloud-computing business and provided revenue and momentum for IBM's software division.\n\nThe consensus estimate by analysts on Yahoo! Finance calls for IBM's revenue to jump 5.5% this year to $66.2 billion and then rise another 4% in fiscal year 2026. Coupled with IBM's solid 2.3% dividend yield, IBM is the rare combination of growth and income in a technology stock.\n\nPaychex\n\nPaychex is a leading provider of payroll, human resources, employee benefits, and retirement services for companies. The company can handle onboarding, performance management, time cards, and payroll processing. The company's revenue has risen dramatically since 2021, topping the $5 billion mark in 2024.\n\nPaychex now counts more than 745,000 clients, with more than half of its revenue coming from services beyond payroll. Its retirement services division had double-digit growth in 2024 and now has $52 billion in assets under management. Revenue in 2025's fiscal Q4 (ended May 31, 2025) was $1.42 billion, up 10% from a year ago. Operating income fell 11% for the quarter, but that was attributed to the company's $4 billion purchase of fellow human capital management company Paycor, which closed in April.\n\nPaychex's growth in areas outside payroll, in addition to its expansion with the purchase of Paycor, should continue to boost revenue. The company is forecasting revenue in the next fiscal year to increase 16.5% to 18.5% and EPS to grow from a range from 8.5% to 10.5%\n\nPaychex stock is up only 2% so far this year but is gathering momentum for a big jump in the next few quarters. The stock trades at a still-reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26 and has an enticing dividend yield of 3%. Paychex is a buy in my book.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:52:45.115692+00:00"}

A recent rally gave IBM a high bar to clear and its software revenue slightly missed estimates.\n\nThe Armonk, N.Y.-based company earned an adjusted $2.80 per share for the June-ended quarter, up 15% from a year earlier. That beat the $2.65 per share that analysts polled by FactSet forecast. Sales increased 8% year over year to $16.98 billion, compared to analyst estimates of $16.59 billion.\n\nOn the stock market today, IBM stock lost 7.6% to close at 260.51. Shares slid below IBM's 50-day moving average and also under a previous 266.45 buy point.\n\nIBM stock had rallied 30% for the year heading into the report. Helped by optimism about enterprise software spending in response to AI advances, shares of the more than century-old tech giant returned to record highs for the first time in a decade last September and have rallied further since then.\n\nThe company touted its AI growth in a news release Wednesday.\n\n\"Our generative AI book of business continues to accelerate and now stands at more than $7.5 billion,\" IBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna said in a news release. \"With our strong first-half performance, we are raising our full-year outlook for free cash flow, which we expect to exceed $13.5 billion.\"\n\nOne year ago, Krishna described IBM's AI book of business as reaching \"more than $2 billion.\" On a call with analysts Wednesday, Krishna said IBM is seeing strong demand for AI agents and its open-source Granite AI models.\n\nAlong with a slight bump in its free-cash-flow guidance (from a previous description of \"about $13.5 billion\"), IBM reiterated its expectation to post revenue growth of at least 5% for 2025.\n\nFind Top-Rated Stocks To Buy And Watch\n\nSoftware Revenue 'Not A Standout'\n\nIBM's overall 8% sales growth marked an acceleration from the roughly 1% year-over-year revenue increases the company posted its previous three quarters.\n\nBut sales for IBM's closely-watched software segment slightly missed Wall Street estimates, contributing to the pressure on IBM stock. Software sales grew 10% year over year to $7.39 billion. Analysts were looking for $7.43 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote to clients late Wednesday that IBM \"software story is solid but not a standout.\"\n\nThill noted that software growth moderate to 8% year-over-year from a 9% in the first quarter when factoring in exchange rates. He reiterated a neutral hold call for IBM stock, preferring Microsoft (MSFT) as the two tech stock trade at similar multiples to forward earnings.\n\nIBM's overall revenue beat was powered by outperformance from its infrastructure segment, which increased sales 14% to $4.14 billion. Analysts had previously forecast $3.76 billion in sales for the segment, according to FactSet. IBM earlier this year launched its AI-focused z17 mainframe. Krishna told analysts that sales for the enterprise data servers are off to a \"very strong start.\"\n\nThe tech giant also managed to post a slight gain in consulting revenue, up 3% to $5.3 billion. Analysts were projecting that sales for the segment could fall by a fraction, to $5.16 billion.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives reiterated an outperform call and price target of 325 for IBM stock following the report.\n\n\"We believe that IBM is well-positioned to capitalize on the current demand shift for hybrid and AI applications with more enterprises looking to implement AI for productivity gains and drive long-term profitable growth,\" Ives wrote to clients early Thursday.\n\nIBM Stock\n\nWith Thursday's slide, IBM stock is ahead about 20% year-to-date and 46% over the past 12 months.\n\nComing into the report, IBM stock had an IBD Composite Rating of 83 out a best possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nFurther, IBM's Relative Strength Rating was 85 out of 99.

Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre joining us now with a closer look, Jared.\n\n00:00:16 Jared Blikre\n\nThank you, Josh. Yes, the Dow's underwater by about 250 points. We had some disappointing earnings reactions in the form of IBM, or from the company's IBM, and also Honeywell. And we'll take a look at the board in a second. Just wanted to show you the intraday price action down about half a percent. And by the way, just want to mention that we missed a record closing high yesterday by only points. It was just very close. But that doesn't really mean too much in the long scheme of things. What matters is that the Dow has been held back by some of these bigger names. And I mentioned IBM and Honeywell, I kind of picked on them, but year to date, they haven't really been the big problem in the Dow. So now we have this heat map for the Dow showing everything, all the components with their year-to-date performance. What stands out? There's Nvidia, the biggest stock in the solar system, up almost 30%. Apple here down 14%. United Health, United Health's down 44%. This is intraday. Just let's dial up that year to date, and you can see they really fell into some problems in that April time period when a lot of stocks, most stocks, were bottoming and rocketing higher after that 4/8 low. That would be April 8th. Salesforce, um, that's United Health again. Salesforce is another one that's been underwater. It's down 20%. Really wasn't able to climb off those lows the way most other stocks were. And in fact, there are four different stocks here that were underwater for the year to date by double digits. And Merck is the last one. It's down 15.5%. Uh, so let me just show you a chart of the Dow. I'm going to arrange everything by performance, and there are four big losers down there: Apple, Merck, Salesforce, and United Health. And I'm going to show you the Dow. This is year to date. And here is yesterday when we just were missing those brand new highs from February, not able to top those. Now, let me show you an alternate scenario chart that I've computed for the Dow taking out some of these components one by one. So I have actually five different lines here. The one at the bottom is the actual Dow. That's in, let's call that peach right there, and it terminates right here at about 45,000. And if you take out United Health, guess what? It rockets up to 46,620. So that's this yellow line right here. And there's a pretty big gap between these two right here. And I should mention too that the Dow is computed as an index. It's calculated as an index a very old-fashioned way. Since the late 1800s, it has been done price-weighted. Now, when we talk about the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, those are market cap or float-weighted. The biggest stocks like Apple and Nvidia, they get the most action, they get the most. But in the Dow, it's the higher price stocks. And it's really interesting because United Health was the highest price stock in the Dow, and it's been cut in half. So that accounts for a lot of the difference here. So just to recap, we got 45,000 right as of yesterday's close. That's Wednesday's close. Without United Health, 46,000. If you take out also Salesforce, goes up to 473. Then if you take out Merck, 475. And finally, if you take out Apple as well, it's 47,989. And by the way, you're hitting record highs on all of those recently, and they have a nice, gently sloping upward trend line instead of a lot of the sideways action that you're seeing in the actual Dow. So it just goes to show you that you can calculate these indices many different ways. And the Dow itself, arguably, kind of like a fund. And it is selected by various people who control the entrants. And we haven't had a change in the Dow since last year, which is why this year-to-date calculation has been helpful here. But it just goes to show you that it only takes a few stocks to really spoil the party and prevent you from getting some of those new highs that we've been getting in the other indices, which are calculated in a much more modern method. I'll send it back to you there.\n\n00:07:04 Speaker A\n\nAll right. Thank you, Jared.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:52:56.908330+00:00"}

The company's focus on enhancing its technological capabilities through partnerships, particularly in AI and cloud solutions, aligns with its revenue growth intentions despite potential headwinds in these sectors. The 23% share price rise last quarter exemplifies investor confidence, though the current price of US$282.01 exceeds the consensus price target of US$273.36, suggesting market expectations might be outpacing analyst projections. Moreover, despite a strong five-year total shareholder return of 194.20%, it indicates a significant appreciation, diverging from the market's lower annual gain of 17.7% last year.\n\nRelative to the US IT industry, which achieved a 31.2% increase over the past year, IBM's performance suggests it has outpaced broader market trends. However, considering the conservative revenue and earnings forecasts, any unexpected economic instability or sectoral slowdown might pose risks to revenue and earnings growth. The ongoing revenue concerns hinge on IBM's capability to manage industry fluctuations and consultative service demand, potentially challenging forecasted growth rates if economic uncertainties persist. Despite these challenges, IBM’s proactive measures, along with its solid dividend payouts, underscore its commitment to enhancing shareholder returns, balancing its higher current valuation against competitive pressures.\n\nGain insights into International Business Machines' outlook and expected performance with our report on the company's earnings estimates.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Is now the time to buy IBM? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nIBM’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 6 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock dropped 7.5% on the news that the company reported mixed first quarter 2025 results as a significant operating income miss weighed on the overall performance. On the other hand, IBM exceeded expectations for revenue, adjusted EPS, and EBITDA. Overall, we think this was a decent quarter, with some key metrics above expectations. The areas below expectations seem to be driving the move, and shares traded down.\n\nIBM is up 18.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $260.90 per share, it is still trading 11.5% below its 52-week high of $294.78 from June 2025.

Shares had been down as much as 10.1% near the start of today's trading.\n\nIBM published its second-quarter results after the market closed yesterday, and actually delivered results that came in significantly better than Wall Street had anticipated. The company also raised its full-year guidance for free cash flow (FCF), but softness in the company's Q2 software numbers is causing investors to move out of the stock.\n\nIBM stock sinks as software revenue misses expectations\n\nIBM reported non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 on revenue of $16.98 billion in the second quarter -- a performance that came in far better than the average analyst estimate's call for adjusted earnings of $2.64 per share on sales of $16.59 billion. The company's revenue was up 8% year over year in the period, and earnings per share were up roughly 18% compared to the prior-year period.\n\nWhile the company's Q2 report looked strong overall, investors are concentrating on a performance shortfall in the software segment. Category revenue climbed 10% year over year to reach $7.39 billion, but the average analyst estimate had called for sales of $7.39 billion in the period. The software business's gross margin of 83.9% also fell slightly short of the average analyst estimate's target for a gross margin of 84% in the period.\n\nWhat's next for IBM?\n\nWith its latest quarterly report, IBM reiterated guidance for sales growth of at least 5% on a currency-adjusted basis this year. Management also said that it now expects to generate more than $13.5 billion in FCF this year -- up from its previous target for FCF of roughly $13.5 billion.\n\nCEO Arvind Krishna said that geopolitical uncertainty is causing some clients to take a more cautious approach to new contracts, and the sales shortfall for the software segment that's central to the company's growth and standing in the artificial intelligence market is causing some investors to lose confidence in the stock.

We are watching Comcast, IBM and Honeywell. First up, shares of Comcast moving on reports that NBC Universal is exploring the launch of a sports cable network to rival Disney's ESPN as early as this fall, according to the Wall Street Journal. Um, the planned network would feature content also available on NBCU's streaming service Peacock, including NBA games, Sunday Night Football, the WNBA and more. Separately, the New York Post reporting Amazon founder Jeff Bezos considering a purchase of NBCU's CNBC. Uh, Ali Kanal is back with us here. Um, and Ali, of course, you track the media industry closely, so it's interesting to get these sort of various threads.\n\n01:46 Ali Kanal\n\nYeah, and it was very interesting and surprising to me a little bit to see this report, considering that we have companies across the media sector, including NBC Universal, that are actually moving away from linear television. So NBC is going to be spinning off most of its cable properties by the end of the year. Warner Brothers Discovery is doing the same thing. They will be separating linear networks from studios and streaming. Those are the growth drivers of their business. At the same time though, we know what keeps butts in seats is sports, right? That's really what consumers are tuning into on television. It's appointment viewing. We know NBC as a whole, they've sync, they've committed a lot of money into various sports leagues, like the NBA, for example. And even a company like Netflix, which previously said it didn't want to be involved in sports, they have been doubling down on that as well. So the sports side of the equation makes sense to me. The cable network situation, I just don't understand how that adds to the value of this company, especially when we know linear network, uh, revenue has been consistently declining here. NBC Universal told me no comment to this report. They also told me no comment to the report that Jeff Bezos was considering a bid for CNBC. There have been other outlets out there that say he's no longer weighing that option, but Julie, nothing really would surprise me here when it comes to the media industry. Things are moving so quickly, so fast, and a lot of these companies are having to pivot just in order to survive here.\n\n04:12 Speaker A\n\nYeah, I think as members of media industry, nothing would surprise us either. Ali, let's talk about IBM though. Software revenue, they are coming in below expectations during the most recent quarter, though headline sales and adjusted earnings per share topped analyst expectations. And on the earnings call, CEO, CEO Arvind Krishna mentioned that geopolitical tensions were causing clients to move cautiously, as he said. He also called out more constrained spending from the US federal government, though he noted the company doesn't expect it to create long-term headwinds. A big tumble there for the shares. Although, we should mention on most metrics, IBM beat, and the shares have been out performers this year. In fact, the stock, um, well within the last month, uh, has been at record highs.\n\n05:49 Ali Kanal\n\nYeah, and if you take a look on a year-to-date basis heading into this earnings print, we were up around 30%. So perhaps some of this good news already priced in, and we've seen that really across the board with a lot of these tech big tech companies, especially those with high valuations. You can just look at Netflix last week, which initiated a beat and raise on that report, and then we saw the stock decline. But like we've been talking about, IBM beat on revenue, margins, free cash flow, gen AI growth also accelerated. In fact, at this point, over 10% of revenue is now tied to gen AI. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who you were just speaking with on the program, he wrote that IBM's business flywheel is starting to accelerate. He said that he would be a buyer in any knee-jerk weakness this morning. The firm did maintain its outperform rating and $325 price target on shares. But you did mention some of that disappointment on the software side. Software is the biggest piece of IBM's business, so maybe that's where investors are hinging their wagon to when it comes to the declines that we're seeing right now in shares. But again, the stock has been an outperformer, especially over the past month.\n\n07:36 Speaker A\n\nRight, exactly. Um, and let's also talk Honeywell. It's lifting its full-year outlook for the second quarter row, as the company continues plans to separate its aerospace, automation and materials units. Honeywell's now expecting organic sales to increase between 4 and 5% for the full year. Earlier this year, Honeywell said it expected $500 million in tariff-related exposure. The shares there, Ali, down about 5%, but for a lot of those big industrial companies, we've actually seen outperformance this year.\n\n08:32 Ali Kanal\n\nRight. And you know, we did see modest declines in operating and segment margins, some softness in industrial automation, maybe that's contributing to some of the declines that we're seeing today, but when we talk about the eventual separation here of this company into three separate publicly traded entities, that has been a long time coming. There's a lot of talk on Wall Street that that's going to unlock value. It's going to be less confusing for investors. It's going to increase the focus on executives. And you can look at this space in general and how we've seen that in the past. General Electric, for example, last year they split their company into three separate businesses: GE Vernova, GE Aerospace, GE Healthcare. We just saw GE Vernova report solid earnings, shares soared. So still a lot to come for Honeywell. I will say when we're looking at the declines in shares today, we're just up around 1% since the start of the year, so not necessarily an outperformer in this environment, but maybe down the line when these com the company separates, we could see a little bit more tail of a tailwind there.\n\n10:08 Speaker A\n\nYeah. And I mean the XLI, um, which is the industrials group, is up 17%. So definitely a pretty big contrast there. Thanks, Ali.

CRWV stated that artificial intelligence (AI) is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market (TAM) is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028, as mentioned on the last earnings call. The company’s first quarter 2025 results show enormous growth, with revenue jumping 420% year over year to about $981.6 million. A backlog of $25.9 billion (including an $11.2 billion OpenAI deal) and partnerships with IBM and other AI labs underline strong demand.\n\nCoreWeave was the earliest cloud to ship NVIDIA’s H100s and H200s GPUs at scale, the first to deploy GB200 NVL72 racks in production, and in July 2025 became a launch partner for the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Server Edition.\n\nHowever, CoreWeave is still unprofitable and has become highly leveraged. It carried about $18.8 billion in total liabilities after the first quarter, of which $8.7 billion was debt. Interest expense swelled to roughly $264 million in the first quarter as a result. This was attributed to changes in vendor payment terms. Management is using debt to mainly finance rapid expansion (notably new data centers). The company now expects interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million for the current quarter.\n\nRecently, CoreWeave announced its intention to offer $1.5 billion in senior notes due 2031 through a private placement, subject to market conditions. It subsequently revised and priced the offering at $1.75 billion—an increase of $250 million from the initial plan. CoreWeave plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment and related expenses.\n\nCoreWeave issued $2 billion in new notes in May and followed that just two months later with this $1.75 billion issuance, which indicates that heavy debt can pose financial risks.\n\nThe company’s aggressive capital deployment strategy remains a concern. CRWV anticipates capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company uses a success-based model, entering capex programs only after securing multi-year customer contracts that cover investment costs within the contract terms, helping it to sensibly scale the debt structure.\n\nCoreWeave plans to release second-quarter 2025 financial results after market close on Aug. 12, 2025.\n\nTaking a Look at the Debt Burden of CRWV’s Competitors\n\nNebius Group N.V. NBIS highlighted on its most recent earnings call that it has no outstanding debt. The company confirms that it holds only an immaterial convertible note. In June 2025, the company announced a private placement of $1 billion in convertible notes to capitalize on the AI-infrastructure boom and drive up revenue opportunities in 2026. It has an ambitious $2 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025. NBIS plans to build a data-center infrastructure pipeline that can offer scalability to more than 1GW of power. With this, NBIS expects significantly higher revenue potential beyond its current guidance.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:53:28.762654+00:00"}

As of this writing, the index is up more than 7% since the start of the year.\n\nBut some components of the S&P 500 -- dividend paying stocks no less -- have provided even better performances than the index as a whole. Let's take a look at three of them today.\n\nBig Blue has delivered big returns this year\n\nClimbing 30% since the start of the year, IBM (IBM -0.80%) is a dividend-paying company that has benefited from its significant business related to artificial intelligence (AI). While it may not have the same name recognition as other AI stocks (I'm looking at you, Nvidia), the company's first-quarter 2025 financial results reaffirmed how robust the AI business is for Big Blue.\n\nFrom the second quarter of 2023 through the first quarter of 2025, IBM has grown its generative-AI book of business -- essentially a running total of active contracts and orders it has secured -- to $6 billion, after securing $1 billion alone in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company is generating strong free cash flow (FCF) as well. In the first quarter, it reported $2 billion in FCF, and management projects 2025 FCF of about $13.5 billion.\n\nFor 30 consecutive years, Big Blue has consistently hiked its dividend, a feat that many tech stocks haven't achieved. With the steadfast dedication to rewarding shareholders, the fact that IBM consistently generates FCF to cover its dividend, and the ample AI exposure, it's no wonder the stock has flourished recently.\n\nA flood of free cash flow has Seagate on investors' minds\n\nAnother company helping to satiate investors' appetite for AI stocks in 2025 is Seagate Technology (STX 2.53%). It has been one of the best performing S&P 500 components, skyrocketing about 73% as of this writing. It's not merely the fact that the company has AI-related business that has excited investors over the past few months; Seagate is seeing the high demand for its mass-capacity data storage products translate to greater cash flow.\n\nAfter reporting $27 million in FCF for the first quarter, Seagate generated $150 million and $216 million in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2025, respectively. Management doesn't expect it to taper off anytime soon, forecasting \"free cash flow generation to improve sequentially through the rest of the calendar year\" on the most recent conference call.\n\nWith the company's increase in cash flow, investors are more confident that the dividend, which currently has a 2% forward yield, is on solid ground.\n\nAT&T provides plentiful passive income\n\nAfter shares of AT&T (T 1.28%) soared 35.7% in 2024, some may have speculated that the stock would slow down in 2025 -- but it hasn't happened yet.\n\nAT&T's stock price has risen some 18% year to date, starting the year on an auspicious note in late January, when the company reported strong fourth-quarter 2024 results. Besides beating analysts' top- and bottom-line estimates, management projected 3% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and $16 billion in FCF for 2025.\n\nWhile some companies fear how provisions in the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" will affect them, AT&T is optimistic. In response to the bill's passage, management said that it expects to invest more rapidly in next-generation networks, adding another 1 million fiber customer locations a year starting in 2026.\n\nCurrently, the stock's forward dividend yield is 4.1%. Lest cautious investors fret that the high yield is a warning flag, the company's consistently strong FCF demonstrates that the payout is on solid ground.\n\nIs it too late to click the buy button on these dividend darlings?\n\nDue to their recent rises, IBM, Seagate, and AT&T stocks are all trading at premiums to their historical valuations. Nonetheless, IBM and Seagate are both worth further investigation as ways to collect some passive income as well as gain exposure to the burgeoning AI industry.\n\nFor those more interested in yield, AT&T is a great option -- though investors may want to wait until the company reports second-quarter results later this month when management will update guidance after passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:53:45.494373+00:00"}

Magnificent Seven stocks are the top influential megacap technology stocks. They also include Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Apple and Facebook parent Meta.\n\nIn a split decision, Tesla missed sales estimates, but Alphabet topped forecasts and raised its spending forecast.

Continuing claims, seen as a barometer of how long people are unemployed, rose to 1.96 million from 1.95 million the prior week.\n\n\"Today’s jobless claims total paints a familiar picture,\" said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley. \"There are still few signs of major cracks in the labor market. And if that picture remains intact, the Fed has one less reason to cut interest rates.\"\n\nInvestors will also continue to look for trade deals to take stocks higher.\n\nThe U.S. and Japan reached a trade deal that would slap a lower-than-originally threatened 15% tax on Japanese imports, and a deal with the European Union is expected to mirror that, reports said.\n\nHowever, EU countries approved a $100 billion-plus package of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that could start in August if no trade agreement is reached, the Wall Street Journal said.\n\nTrump continues to pressure Powell\n\nPresident Donald Trump plans to visit the Federal Reserve construction site at 4 p.m. ET, according to the White House schedule. The visit would mark the first time in nearly two decades that an American president has made an official trip to the central bank, whose independence from elected officials is a hallmark of the Fed.\n\nThe unusual move is seen as part of Trump's pressure campaign for Powell to resign or lower interest rates. The Trump administration has said it's scrutinizing Powell's handling of the overbudget renovation of the Fed headquarters.\n\nCorporate news\n\nIBM's second-quarter revenue missed expectations.

Free cash flow of $146 million is -89% down from a year ago (it had been estimated at $760 million), while Global Vehicle Inventory has grown almost a full week to 24 days. But Robotaxis are still looking at a 2026 launch, so shares are up slightly on this news.\n\n\n\nIBM IBM shares are shifting lower, by -5%, even after Big Blue outpaced on earnings — $2.80 per share versus estimates for $2.64 per share — on $16.98 billion in revenues, which bolted ahead of the expectations for $16.58 billion. The company, which also acquired AI consulting firm Hakkoda in the quarter, has been trading up +28% year to date, and so this good news is being met with a -5% haircut in after-hours trading.\n\n\n\nChipotle CMG shares are down -10% after its earnings results after today’s close were flat to mixed: earnings of 33 cents per share beat by a penny, while revenues came in even with estimates at $3.10 billion.

This compares to earnings of $2.43 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of +6.06%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this technology and consulting company would post earnings of $1.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.6, delivering a surprise of +12.68%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nIBM, which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, posted revenues of $16.98 billion for the quarter ended June 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.40%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $15.77 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nIBM shares have added about 28.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for IBM?\n\nWhile IBM has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for IBM was unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

This shows demand was soft, a poor baseline for our analysis.\n\nWith $64.04 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, IBM is a behemoth in the business services sector and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge in distribution. This also enables it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors and the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because it’s harder to find incremental growth when you’ve penetrated most of the market. For IBM to boost its sales, it likely needs to adjust its prices, launch new offerings, or lean into foreign markets.\n\nA company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul.\n\nWith a corporate history spanning over a century and once known for its iconic mainframe computers, IBM (NYSE:IBM) provides hybrid cloud computing platforms, AI solutions, consulting services, and enterprise infrastructure to help businesses modernize their operations.\n\n\"We once again exceeded expectations for revenue, profit and free cash flow in the quarter.

Find out in our full research report .\n\nTechnology and consulting giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market’s revenue expectations , with sales up 7.7% year on year to $16.98 billion. On the other hand, next quarter’s revenue guidance of $15.72 billion was less impressive, coming in 2.3% below analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.80 per share was 5.5% above analysts’ consensus estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIBM Quarterly Revenue\n\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. IBM’s annualized revenue growth of 2.9% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, but we were still disappointed by the results.\n\nIBM Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\n\nWe can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segment, Software. Over the last two years, IBM’s Software revenue averaged 7.8% year-on-year growth. This segment has outperformed its total sales during the same period, lifting the company’s performance.\n\nThis quarter, IBM reported year-on-year revenue growth of 7.7%, and its $16.98 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 2.4%. Company management is currently guiding for a 5% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\n\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 6% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is above the sector average and implies its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) stock benefiting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses – everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\n\nIBM has managed its cost base well over the last five years. It demonstrated solid profitability for a business services business, producing an average operating margin of 13.4%.\n\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, IBM’s operating margin rose by 4.9 percentage points over the last five years, showing its efficiency has improved.\n\nIBM Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nIn Q2, IBM generated an operating margin profit margin of 12.9%, down 2.4 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.\n\nIBM’s EPS grew at a weak 3.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. On the bright side, this performance was better than its flat revenue and tells us management responded to softer demand by adapting its cost structure.\n\nIBM Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\nDiving into the nuances of IBM’s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, IBM’s operating margin declined this quarter but expanded by 4.9 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its higher earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals.\n\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\n\nFor IBM, its two-year annual EPS growth of 8.9% was higher than its five-year trend. Accelerating earnings growth is almost always an encouraging data point.\n\nIn Q2, IBM reported EPS at $2.80, up from $2.43 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 5.5%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects IBM’s full-year EPS of $10.62 to grow 6.7%.\n\nKey Takeaways from IBM’s Q2 Results\n\nIt was encouraging to see IBM beat analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also happy its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its operating income missed and its revenue guidance for next quarter fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a mixed quarter. The stock traded down 5.5% to $266.63 immediately after reporting.\n\nThe latest quarter from IBM’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. If you’re making that decision, you should consider the bigger picture of valuation, business qualities, as well as the latest earnings.

And with federal incentives meant to encourage EV sales set to disappear later this year, things are likely to get even more challenging in the coming months.\n\nThat’s piling pressure on Musk to push Tesla’s robotaxi program, that began operating on a limited basis in Austin last month.

The stock has taken a hit as well, down 31% from a December peak when Musk’s proximity to Trump was seen as a boon for the company.\n\nStill, Tesla shares remain richly valued at 142 times projected profits, compared with 27 times for the Nasdaq 100 Index, reflecting a significant disconnect from the company’s souring financial prospects.\n\nWall Street has slashed 2025 profit estimates by 28% over the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the second quarter, analysts are projecting adjusted earnings of 42 cents a share on revenue of $22.6 billion, down 18% and 11%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.

Examples include Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai, Arvind Krishna of IBM, Raj Subramaniam of FedEx, Shantanu Narayen of Adobe, Nikesh Arora of Palo Alto Networks and Vivek Sankaran of Albertsons. More Indians come to the U.S. on student visas than any other nationality—with 422,335 foreign students from India in the U.S. last year, vs. 329,541 foreign students from China. The number of Americans studying in India is a fraction of that, almost too few to measure.\n\nThe importance of India to Fortune 500 companies will only increase in the coming years—the country boasts a young and well-educated population, anticipated GDP growth north of 6% every year for the next decade, and structural reforms that will boost the business climate in the world’s largest democracy.\n\nIt’s equally important that policymakers understand what’s going on. The rising importance of China over my lifetime spurred growth in scholarship—from experts at think tanks in both countries to the Schwarzman Scholars program at Beijing’s Tsinghua University that Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman launched a decade ago as an analog to Oxford’s Rhodes Scholarship.\n\nNow, venture capitalist and philanthropist Asha Jadeja is investing in a similar academic infrastructure between the U.S. and India. (She and her late husband Rajeev Motwani of Stanford were founding stakeholders in Google.) I spoke to Jadeja this past weekend at a dinner marking the establishment of the Motwani Jadeja Institute for American Studies at OP Jindal Global University. She has also funded programs at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, U.C. San Diego, the Hudson Institute, the Center for a New American Security and, soon, Columbia University.\n\n“When policymakers want information in making decisions, they pick up the phone and call Georgetown or Stanford. Similarly, if someone in Delhi wants to know how to deal with America on mineral rights or human rights, they need someone to call who has a serious understanding of those issues and access to data,” she told Fortune.\n\nWith Washington increasingly viewing China as not just a competitor but as an adversary, India is taking on a larger geopolitical importance. The next generation of CEOs and policymakers will need context and relationships created through education, familiarity and a shared understanding nurtured by deep scholarship.\n\n\n\nContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:54:26.471225+00:00"}

The Dow and the Nasdaq were on either side of today’s flat market: +179, +0.40% on the former and -81 points, -0.39% the latter.

Guidance was raised somewhat, but not to the levels one might expect with such big quarterly beats. Shares are -7% in late trading.\n\n\n\nCapital One Financial COF swept past earnings estimates this afternoon — a bottom line of $5.48 per share was well ahead of the $3.83 anticipated, with revenues of $12.49 billion above the $12.22 billion expected. This is perhaps a tough quarter to assess for the credit card giant, as its Discover acquisition is still being digested through its system. Shares are up +1.5% on the news in the after-market.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Expect from the Stock Market Wednesday\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting Home Sales for June are expected to dip just a tad to 4.0 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units. This would bring us back down to levels not seen since October of last year. In the previous report from this metric, the Northeast grew the fastest, +4.2%, followed by the Midwest at +2.1% and the South -1.7%. The West was the only region in the negative, -5.4% a month ago.\n\n\n\nIt will also be an eventful day for earnings reports tomorrow, mostly after the market close.

Many CEOs appreciate his focus on deregulation and lowering taxes.\n\nBut there's a catch: Trump has strong views on how managers should run their businesses and no compunctions about using the power of the presidency to bully bosses into doing it his way. Many CEOs are learning how to accommodate the micromanager in chief, some through lip service and others through actual business decisions.\n\nSome of Trump's interventions are remarkably mundane. He wants Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar in its soda instead of corn syrup. Coke says it will actually do what Trump wants, even though sugar is more expensive and Trumpa-Cola will probably cost more.\n\nOther demands are far more problematic. He wants the Washington Commanders football team and the Cleveland Guardians baseball team to revert to their former names, the racially insensitive Redskins and Indians, respectively. That's Trump using professional sports franchises to push his anti-woke agenda to the extreme, which may not hurt Trump, but it puts the two teams in a lose-lose position by reigniting controversies they thought they had finally put behind them.\n\nRaising cane: President Trump is lobbying for real sugar in Coke. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) · ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nTrump's most meddlesome gambit is his trade policy, which is meant to literally force thousands of US companies to reorganize the way they do business by buying less abroad and more domestically. He directly threatened Apple with a 25% tax if it doesn't start making iPhones in the United States. After Mattel said it would have to raise prices because of Trump's tariffs, Trump threatened a 100% tax on products the toymaker imports and threatened that Mattel \"won’t sell one toy in the United States.\"\n\nTrump said he'd hit Harley-Davidson with a \"big tax\" if it went through with a plan to move some motorcycle production overseas. When Walmart said it would likely pass along the cost of Trump's tariffs to its own customers, Trump told Walmart it should \"eat the tariffs\" — pay the cost and accept lower profits — and warned, \"I'll be watching.\"\n\nRead more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\n\nTrump's manhandling of corporate America is hitting the bottom line. General Motors (GM) said on July 22 that Trump's tariffs shaved $1.1 billion off its second quarter profits and will likely cost the company as much as $5 billion this year. The day before, Jeep maker Stellantis (STLA) said the Trump tariffs contributed to a $2.7 billion loss in the first half of 2025. The second quarter earnings season is just getting started, so that may just be a taste of the losses related to Trump's rewiring of global supply chains.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:54:36.412130+00:00"}

IBM's results will offer an early look at how the enterprise technology market is holding up against government spending cuts and tariff uncertainty.\n\nIBM stock is ahead more than 28% overall this year. Shares of the more than century-old tech giant returned to record highs for the first time in a decade last September and have rallied further since then.\n\nHere's what to watch from IBM's Q2 report:\n\nIBM Q2 Earnings Preview: Numbers To Watch\n\nIBM's earnings are seen increasing 9% to $2.65 per share on an adjusted basis, according to FactSet. IBM's adjusted earnings declined 5% to $1.60 in the company's March-ended quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect IBM to post sales of $16.59 billion for Q2, representing 5% year-over-year growth. That would mark an improvement from the roughly 1% sales growth that IBM has posted for three consecutive quarters.\n\nIBM Stock: Software Segment In Focus\n\nIBM stock fell following the company's first-quarter earnings report in April. The tech giant beat top and bottom-line expectations but its software sales growth slowed to 7%, compared to 10% growth in the fourth-quarter. Investors will be watching whether IBM's software business — which includes its Red Hat cloud-management software — slows further.\n\nAnalysts forecast roughly 10% growth for IBM's software segment in Q2, representing $7.43 billion in sales.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote to clients Monday that he is bullish on IBM's agility to sustain its software momentum.\n\n\"Leading indicators remain healthy, with Red Hat continuing to benefit from enterprise modernization and hybrid cloud adoption,\" Thill wrote.\n\nHe added that automation work from enterprises is boosting some of IBM's software segments, including the recently acquired HashiCorp.\n\nThill holds a neutral hold call on IBM stock, however. He noted that Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) are growing at faster rates.\n\nTough Setup For IBM?\n\nBofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan rates IBM stock a buy. But he said the stock faces a \"tough near-term setup\" given IBM's outperformance of the S&P 500 this year.\n\nMohan expects IBM's consulting segment to be \"relatively muted\" while its infrastructure revenue could get a boost from its new AI-focused z17 mainframes.\n\n\"AI should be a relative tailwind to both consulting and software and we expect to see further evidence of pickup in enterprise AI spending,\" Mohan wrote to clients on Monday.\n\nOverall, analysts are projecting IBM's infrastructure revenue will grow 3% to $3.75 billion, according to FactSet. Consulting revenue is seen falling by less than 1%, to $5.17 billion.\n\nIBM Stock: Nearing Test Of 5o-Day Line\n\nMeanwhile, IBM stock was down 1% at 281.47 in recent action on the stock market today.\n\nIBM shares broke out above a 266.45 consolidation pattern entry on May 15. Shares rallied further to reach an intraday record high of 296.16 on June 25.\n\nA recent pullback has seen IBM stock fall about 5% so far in July. Shares fell below IBM stock's 21-day moving average earlier this month and are approaching a test of the 50-day line.\n\nMeanwhile, IBM stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 84 out a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

The QQQ was down slightly at around $563 in the opening minutes of Tuesday's session.\n\nBelow, we break down the technicals on QQQ’s chart and identify price levels that investors will likely be watching.\n\nPrice Discovery\n\nAfter breaking out from a flag pattern late last month, QQQ’s price has continued its move into price discovery. Importantly, the breakout coincided with the 50-day moving average (MA) crossing above the 200-day MA to form a golden cross, a bullish chart signal that indicates the start of a new uptrend.\n\nMoreover, the relative strength index has remained near its overbought threshold since early May, confirming the fund’s strong price momentum.\n\nLet’s apply technical analysis to forecast a near-term overhead target worth watching if the fund's price continues making new highs and also identify support levels to monitor during future retracements.\n\nMeasured Move Near-Term Price Target\n\nInvestors can forecast a near-term overhead price target by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle.\n\nWhen applying the analysis to QQQ’s chart, we calculate the distance of the trend higher that immediately preceded the flag and add that amount to the pattern's breakout area. For example, we add $53 to $536, which projects a bullish target of $589, about 4% above Monday’s closing price.\n\nSupport Levels to Monitor\n\nDuring retracements, it's initially worth monitoring the $540 level. This area, just above the rising 50-day MA, would likely attract strong buying interest near the top of the flag pattern and two prominent peaks that formed on the chart in December and February.\n\nFinally, a more significant pullback in the QQQs could see the price revisit lower support around $515. Investors may look for entry points in this location near a trendline that links a range of corresponding price action on the chart between November and June.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Unlike traditional binary computers, which store zeros and ones separately in bits, quantum computers can store them simultaneously in qubits. That difference allows quantum computers to process more data at a faster rate than their binary counterparts.\n\nYet, quantum computers are also larger, pricier, and consume more power than traditional servers. They also tend to output a higher percentage of errors. As a result, quantum computers are still mainly used for niche projects at government and research institutions.\n\nBut as quantum processing units (QPUs) become smaller, more power-efficient, and better at detecting errors, quantum computing systems will likely become more practical for handling mainstream computing applications. From 2024 to 2032, Fortune Business Insights expects the quantum computing market to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.8%.\n\nTherefore, it could be a great time to invest in the market's early movers. Let's examine four quantum computing stocks that could profit from that expansion: IonQ (IONQ -4.36%), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 6.59%), International Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), and Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%).\n\nThe pure-play quantum stocks: IonQ and D-Wave Quantum\n\nIonQ and D-Wave Quantum are both pure-play quantum computing stocks. They're both developing promising quantum technologies, but they're also unprofitable and aren't generating enough revenue to support their near-term valuations. However, they could become great long-term plays as they scale up their businesses.\n\nIonQ sells three quantum systems: its older Aria system, its flagship Forte system, and its data-center-oriented Forte Enterprise system. It will launch its fourth system, the Tempo, later this year. It also provides access to its quantum computing systems as a cloud-based service.\n\nThe company develops its QPUs with a proprietary \"trapped ion\" technology to maintain a longer coherence (the time it can maintain an uninterrupted quantum state) and a higher error-detection rate than more traditional QPUs. It expects its quantum computing power, which it measures in algorithmic qubits (AQ), to soar from 36 AQ in 2024 to 64 AQ in 2025, 256 AQ in 2026, 384 AQ in 2027, and 1,024 AQ in 2028.\n\nD-Wave develops quantum annealing tools, which help companies streamline their schedules, workflows, supply chains, and logistics networks by running them through its quantum computing systems. As a quantum-powered \"efficiency expert,\" D-Wave identities the processes that consume the least power as the most efficient ones. That approach could eventually make it a threat to traditional analytics and digital workflow companies.\n\nD-Wave designs its own chips and hardware, and it's been integrating its Leap quantum computing platform into the world's top cloud infrastructure platforms. It already serves more than 100 major customers, and it could gain a lot more attention as the quantum market expands.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect IonQ and D-Wave to grow their revenues at a CAGR of 88% and 103%, respectively. IonQ and D-Wave might seem pricey at 40 times and 72 times, respectively, their projected sales for 2027, but they could grow much larger over the next few decades.\n\nThe conservative quantum plays: IBM and Microsoft\n\nIf IonQ and D-Wave seem too hot to handle, blue chip tech giants IBM and Microsoft can offer you some less volatile exposure to the quantum computing market.\n\nOver the past few years, IBM has spun off its slow-growth infrastructure services business and expanded its hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) businesses. That strategy helped it grow again after enduring years of shriveling sales and profits. But IBM has also been quietly expanding its quantum computing business, which hosts a fleet of quantum computers that each sport at least 127 qubits of processing power. As of last year, it's deployed over 80 quantum systems worldwide to run more than 3 trillion programs per day.\n\nIBM's quantum business won't generate meaningful revenues anytime soon, but analysts expect its earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a robust CAGR of 16% from 2024 to 2027. It also looks reasonably valued at 26 times its forward adjusted earnings and pays a decent forward yield of 2.3%.\n\nMicrosoft's growth over the past decade was largely driven by the expansion of its cloud, mobile, and AI services. But it's also been adding quantum computing tools to its own cloud infrastructure platform via Azure Quantum, it's partnering with quantum start-ups such as Atom Computing and Quantinuum, and it recently revealed a tiny new quantum computing chip -- the Majorana 1 -- which is roughly the size of a desktop central processing unit (CPU).\n\nThe expansion of that fledgling business should support the ongoing growth of its core cloud, enterprise software, and AI businesses. From fiscal 2025 (which ended this June) to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Microsoft's EPS to grow at a CAGR of 14% as it continues to expand its sprawling ecosystem. Its stock might seem a bit pricey at 33 times its forward adjusted earnings, and it pays a paltry forward yield of only 0.7%, but it's still a balanced way to gain some exposure to the growing quantum market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:54:48.056074+00:00"}

Nevertheless, as of this writing, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 7%, 8%, and 5%, respectively.\n\nHowever, many stocks have put those returns to shame.\n\nThree Motley Fool contributing analysts identified three stocks that have more than doubled the return of the S&P 500 so far this year: Meta Platforms (META 3.16%), International Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), and Palantir Technologies (PLTR 2.30%).\n\nIs it time to load up on them?\n\nMeta generates roughly $470 million in revenue every day\n\nJake Lerch (Meta Platforms): As of this writing, shares of Meta Platforms are up 20% year to date, nearly triple the return of the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\nClearly, Meta is firing on all cylinders, but what is behind its big rally, and will it continue?\n\nTo start, Meta's stock is surging because the company's business model continues to prove its worth. Meta has more than 3 billion daily average users across its platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, meaning it can place millions of ads each day, which, in turn, generates a daily average of around $470 million in revenue for the company.\n\nBetter still, a tremendous share of Meta's revenue is converted into profit. Indeed, the company's operating margin stands at 43%. For context, many analysts view a margin of 10% to be healthy, while 20% is considered high.\n\nEven within the lofty ranks of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" Meta's margin shines. It ranks third -- behind only Nvidia (the world's largest company by market cap) and Microsoft (the world's second-largest company by market cap).\n\nTurning to its future, Meta appears very well positioned. With so much of the world's population already using its platforms on a daily basis, Meta can afford to invest heavily in new initiatives. It has spent heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, and it now appears ready to unleash the potential of that investment.\n\nThe company plans to roll out automated advertising -- powered by AI -- across its platforms by the end of 2026. This could introduce a new lucrative revenue stream for the company, further boosting its already impressive revenue and profit totals.\n\nMeta stock has outperformed the market so far this year, and it may continue to do so thanks to its immense user base, strong margins, and AI-powered innovations.\n\nInvestors should not ignore the quiet comeback of this tech giant\n\nWill Healy (International Business Machines): Investors can likely be forgiven for not noticing the comeback in IBM stock.\n\nThe venerable tech giant struggled throughout the 2010s as growth in its consulting and tech infrastructure businesses slowed dramatically, and most investors seemed to turn their attention to newer and seemingly more cutting-edge tech companies.\n\nHowever, its paradigm began to shift when IBM bought cloud giant Red Hat in 2019. Soon after, IBM appointed Arvind Krishna, the executive who drove this purchase, as its CEO in April 2020.\n\nThat move enabled IBM to emerge as one of the leaders in the hybrid cloud. Also, with its spinoff of its managed infrastructure business into Kyndryl, it was free to focus more heavily on cloud, AI, and supercomputing enterprises.\n\nWith that, investors again began taking notice of the stock, particularly after the end of the 2022 bear market. So profound is its growth that it returned to its previous all-time high in 2024, and its growth has continued. In 2025, the stock is up 30%.\n\nAdmittedly, the company has more work to do. In the first quarter of 2025, revenue rose by only 1%. Nonetheless, its software segment, which accounts for all of the company's current growth, was up 7%, signaling that improved growth could be at hand.\n\nAdditionally, it approved its 30th consecutive dividend increase earlier this year. At $6.72 per share annually, its dividend yield is around 2.4%, almost double the S&P 500 average of 1.2%. That dividend should make the stock more attractive for income investors.\n\nIndeed, the buy case is more unclear for growth investors considering its 49 P/E ratio. Still, a forward P/E ratio of 26 implies that significant financial improvement is forthcoming, and it appears to be positioned to match the market's performance. That factor likely makes IBM a buy for investors seeking both income and growth.\n\nPalantir Technologies continued to soar, doubling already since January\n\nJustin Pope (Palantir Technologies): Artificial intelligence software is already changing the world, and Palantir Technologies has become the face of that.\n\nThe company develops custom software applications for government and corporate clients that utilize a combination of AI, machine learning, and data analytics to address some of the world's most pressing challenges. The company formally launched its AIP platform for AI applications in 2023, and Palantir's growth has continued to accelerate since then.\n\nThere are 20,000 large businesses in the United States alone, so Palantir, with fewer than 450 U.S. commercial customers, has a tremendous growth opportunity ahead. That has investors expecting big things in the future, which continues to propel Palantir's stock to great heights. Shares gained 1,600% over the past three years, including a 100% run since the start of 2025.\n\nWhile you never know how high a stock can go, it's probably not wise to buy here -- Palantir trades at astronomical valuations, which will likely weigh on the stock's future performance.\n\nAnalysts estimate Palantir will grow earnings by an average of 31% annually over the long term, which is blistering fast growth. Yet Palantir trades at a forward P/E ratio of 261, versus 22 for the S&P 500, which has historically grown at an annualized rate of approximately 10%.\n\nSo, Palantir, anticipated to grow 3 times faster than the S&P 500, is valued nearly 12 times higher? It doesn't make sense. Therefore, it's probably best to avoid chasing this red-hot stock until that ratio comes back to Earth a bit.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:54:49.711344+00:00"}

An inordinate amount of time in the world of crypto has been spent on discussing whether or not Ethereum will succeed and become the foundation for the next iteration of global commerce and finance. All this speculation is wasted effort. Ethereum has already won. The losers just don't know it yet.\n\nYou may be tempted to discount my opinion because I'm a notorious ETH \"maxi\" and have been for a little over a decade now. Hear me out anyway.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the CoinDesk Headlines Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .\n\nSide note: Yes. Really. Over a decade. Vitalik Buterin got me started on Ethereum and in my prior incarnation as an IBM executive, I showed off IBM's first foray into blockchain technology at CES in January 2015. That's a story for another day, but I've been in this since the beginning.\n\nBlockchains are, first and foremost, technology platforms. We talk about them like they are financial systems, but they behave, and they grow, like technology platforms. And if we look at the history of technology platforms, we can see some clear patterns emerging that Ethereum tends to follow.\n\nFirst, it's a winner-take-nearly-all business. IBM has 100% of the mainframe software business. Windows has 90% of desktops. Android covers about 90% of all smartphones. TCP/IP is about 99.9% of all network traffic.\n\nThis pattern repeats itself because computing platforms have two factors going in favor of a winner-take-all business model. First, zero marginal cost from adding users. Each additional user costs nearly nothing, so networks can add new users for free.\n\nSecond, network effects mean that more users make networks more valuable and, as a result, it's extremely hard (but not impossible) for laggards to catch up with the leaders.\n\nIn the early days of platform development, it's often easy for winners to come and go. Network effects aren't big enough matter, and better products can sweep aside prior leaders. We saw this early in the world of PC and mobile devices as early leaders (Apple II, Commodore 64, and later with Nokia and Blackberry smartphones) were swept aside by impressive new platforms.\n\nIn all those cases, however, the platform \"type\" was itself very new (less than a decade old) and broad adoption was also relatively low (under 10% of the public) . With Ethereum's official 10th birthday at hand, we have passed by both of those metrics. By many accounts more than 20% of the U.S. population owns crypto and blockchain platforms are more than a decade old now.\n\nThere are, from a technological standpoint, better blockchains than Ethereum out there. One of the foundation lessons of global standards is this: the best technology never wins. From video cassettes to DVDs to mobile computing, platforms gain traction when they get \"good enough\" for a certain set of use cases like payments of NFTs. Many of the most successful platforms never really solve all their key issues and they often get shoe-horned into use cases for which they were never really intended.\n\nCase in point: the internet itself was never designed for voice and video and has never really fixed issues with quality-of-service management. But it's good enough and we all have it, so that's how we make calls these days.\n\nYeah, but?\n\nSo, if Ethereum really won, you might be asking, why are there still so many other thriving blockchain ecosystems? I think there are two answers.\n\nFirst, big network and technology leadership wins don't happen instantly. They take years to manifest fully and in the fog of battle, it can be hard to see who is pulling ahead.\n\nWith Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake and the creation of the L2 ecosystem, it's clear the network has seen off its biggest challengers and is steadily building on an already dominant position. Number two players will come and go, but turning back Ethereum’s dominance now looks nearly impossible.\n\nEthereum had a near-100% share of the smart contract ecosystem for a long time. As other chains came online, Ethereum's share of key measures like the DeFi ecosystem fell significantly, bottoming out at around 50% in 2023. Since then, it has stabilized and started to rise again, fueled by the success of the L2 ecosystem. No other single ecosystem has even a 10% share of the total market.\n\nThis isn't an unusual pattern. Microsoft Windows became the largest desktop computing platform in 1984 after a fierce fight in a crowded market. At that time, it still faced intense competition from Commodore, Atari, Apple and others. NeXT, Commodore, Atari, and the Apple II continued to be sold well into the 1990s. BlackBerry sales actually kept rising for the first two years the iPhone was available. Only the Mac survived the long-term PC competition.\n\nIn the mainframe business, the exit path was even longer. IBM came to dominate the mainframe business after the release of the System/360 in 1964. Unisys, IBM's last global competitor created by the merger of Burroughs and Sperry (of Univac fame) , manufactured their last proprietary hardware mainframe in 2015.\n\nSecondly, the structure of the blockchain ecosystem itself will further extend the \"shelf-life\" of those networks that failed to gain traction. Most of these are run by foundations, not corporations. As such, there are no shareholders who can demand a return on their capital. Consequently, there's no real exit pressure on chains that haven't succeeded. Expect them to keep on releasing minor updates and mountains of Ethereum-related-concerns on X for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf there is one final lesson we should take from the world of technology standards, it is this: once locked in place, it is astonishingly difficult and exceedingly rare for the leaders to lose their top spot. Windows has been the winner on the desktop since 1984. IBM has won the data center since 1964. I'm willing to bet that Ethereum will still be the world's preeminent blockchain ecosystem in 50 years.\n\nDisclaimer: These are the personal views of the author and do not represent the views of EY.\n\n\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:56:24.688779+00:00"}

Statista estimates that spending on cybersecurity will reach $196.51 billion this year, and increase to $262.29 billion by 2030. That's a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 6%.\n\nCompanies are investing in cybersecurity in response to the growing threat of state-sponsored cyberattacks. In addition, businesses and individuals are increasingly using technology to store sensitive information such as financial records, health information, and personally identifying information.\n\nWhile there are some interesting pure-play cybersecurity stocks, I think it's also beneficial to look beyond the obvious when choosing how to play the sector. For my money, I think a diverse field of cybersecurity stocks includes International Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%), and CrowdStrike (CRWD 2.23%).\n\nRead on to see how these companies are becoming leaders in the cybersecurity space, and would be ideal long-term investments.\n\n1. International Business Machines\n\nIBM, as it is commonly called, is one of the best-known and most important computer companies in the world. It has an amazing past that traces its history to the beginning of the 20th century and its first data processing machines, a punched card tabulator. IBM would go on to popularize the personal computer in the 1980s and was one of the early adopters of artificial intelligence with its Deep Blue supercomputer, which famously defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n\nHowever, IBM today is very much focused on cybersecurity, cloud computing, and consulting. It has products to help businesses prepare for cyber threats, AI-powered cybersecurity solutions, and security consulting and management. It also has a dominant 81% position in the mainframe market favored by Fortune 500 corporations, in part because of their protection against cyberattacks -- even if part of the mainframe goes down, the rest of the computer can continue to keep the business operational.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft isn't a pure-play cybersecurity company either, but that's why I like it. Buying Microsoft stock gets you exposure to the cybersecurity space as well as the amazing array of products that Microsoft has, including Its Azure cloud services, the Microsoft 365 suite of products, Windows, Xbox gaming, and more.\n\nBut this is a big cybersecurity play. Microsoft reported $20 billion in cybersecurity revenue in 2024, which is nearly as much as five of the top pure-play companies combined.\n\nMicrosoft's AI-powered security products operate on a zero-trust framework, which means everything is treated as a potential threat and investigated accordingly. Essentially, every time a user makes a request in the platform, Microsoft's security system will reverify the user to make sure it's not a malicious request.\n\nThe products are integrated into Microsoft's Azure and Microsoft 365 suite of office products, which completely embeds Microsoft into a company's cybersecurity plan. That's a moat that other companies can only dream of having.\n\n3. CrowdStrike\n\nThis is the only pure-play cybersecurity stock on the list. It's best known for its endpoint platform, Falcon, which uses artificial intelligence to stop threats on laptops, servers, and mobile devices.\n\nThe brilliance of CrowdStrike's business model is in its module system. The company provides 30 modules on its Falcon platform to give clients a customized solution for their cybersecurity needs. And once a company is hooked on a module, it's pretty easy to expand as it sees something else that would be useful. It's a tremendously sticky product and it would be difficult for companies to disengage once they are so reliant on the Falcon platform.\n\nCrowdStrike says nearly half of its customers use more than six modules, and 22% of them use eight or more.\n\nCrowdStrike believes that the total addressable market for its platform is $116 billion this year, and increasing to $250 billion by 2029. As CrowdStrike only had $4 billion in revenue in the last year, the company has a massive opportunity for growth.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:56:34.183307+00:00"}

IBM has released several powerful quantum computers and plans to invest $30 billion in its quantum program.  Quantum computing could be the next area of explosive growth in the tech sector.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/20/2-top-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-in-july/", "published_at": "2025-07-20T16:20:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Quantum computing could be the next area of explosive growth in the tech sector. The consultants at McKinsey Digital have estimated that the industry could be worth as much as $1.3 billion by 2035, though there's a lot of uncertainty.\n\nIf that huge number becomes reality, successful quantum computing companies are going to make their investors very happy. Here are two picks to consider buying this month.\n\nIonQ is a high-risk, high-reward company\n\nQuantum physics experts Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim started IonQ (IONQ -4.36%) in 2015. Six years later, it became the first pure-play quantum computing company to go public.\n\nSince the technology is still in the early stages, and it's IonQ's only business, the company isn't profitable yet. Its revenue nearly doubled to $43.1 million last year, but its costs also increased, leading to a net loss of $331.6 million.\n\nProfitability is likely still several years away. CEO Peter Chapman believes it will happen by 2030 and is projecting sales near $1 billion at that point. Fortunately, IonQ has a strong balance sheet and recently sold $1 billion in common stock, giving it nearly $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents it can tap.\n\nWhat makes IonQ unique compared to other quantum computing companies is its trapped-ion technology. These computers store data using quantum bits, or qubits for short. The most widely used quantum computing method is superconducting qubits. IonQ's computers use trapped ions that are controlled with precise laser pulses.\n\nTrapped-ion technology has a few notable advantages. It delivers high fidelity, a term that refers to the accuracy of a quantum computer. One of the major quantum computing challenges is eliminating errors. No company has solved this yet, but IonQ achieved a significant breakthrough in September 2024, when it reported it had the first trapped-ion quantum system to surpass 99.9% fidelity.\n\nTrapped-ion qubits also have longer coherence times. Qubits decay over time and lose their quantum properties. Coherence time refers to the amount of time a qubit can maintain its quantum state. With solid-state quantum computing systems, coherence time is normally measured in microseconds to milliseconds. Trapped-ion systems measure coherence time in seconds to minutes, so it's a sizable difference.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that IonQ has the best quantum computing method; if so, everyone would be using trapped ions. But it has something different that delivers extremely low error rates. It has also picked up several high-profile contracts, including multiple deals with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab and one with the Department of Defense, making it worth a look for investors.\n\nIBM is a pioneer in quantum computing\n\nCloud services, software, and artificial intelligence (AI) may be the core businesses of International Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), but the company also has a long history with quantum computing. It started developing quantum computers over 30 years ago and has been responsible for notable advancements.\n\nIt released IBM Eagle, the first processor to surpass 100 qubits, in 2021. Its IBM Condor is currently the second-largest quantum computer in the world as measured by qubits.\n\nThe company has released a quantum development road map with ambitious milestones. It plans to demonstrate an example of quantum advantage in 2026, which refers to a quantum computer solving a problem faster than any classical computer can. By 2029, it plans to develop Quantum Starling, a fault-tolerant quantum computer -- one that can operate even in the presence of errors.\n\nBecause of its size and financial strength, the company can invest much more in quantum computing than a start-up like IonQ can. In April, it announced plans to spend $30 billion on the technology and mainframes as part of a five-year, $150 billion pledge to invest in U.S. computer manufacturing.\n\nIBM reported $14.5 billion in revenue and $8 billion in gross profit for the first quarter of 2025, both slight improvements year over year. Its increase in gross profit margin was more impressive, from 53.5% to 55.2%. The tech company ended the quarter with $17.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, so it's well equipped to continue building its quantum computing program.\n\nIts share price has already jumped 29% this year, so it has gotten more expensive. However, it trades at less than 27 times adjusted forward earnings estimates, a reasonable valuation.\n\nQuantum computing investments are still speculative. We don't know when or if such machines will become widely used. With that kind of uncertainty, it wouldn't be wise to bet the farm on quantum computing, but you may want to add some exposure by picking up shares of IonQ, IBM, or both.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:56:40.891170+00:00"}

And that's, you know, you and I've been following these tech stocks for a long time, right? And there's some like Oracle, which we've been speaking about recently and watching that have sort of found new life because of this AI wave. How much further can it take them?\n\n00:37 Paul\n\nYeah, there are a couple of blasts from the past, I would say Oracle and AI, but I don't think Oracle and AI with its any kind of tilt towards a large language model or even its apps is the big deal. It's OCI, right? Their cloud computing infrastructure. That's very much like Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS. If it was just an AI hopeful software company, I wouldn't have the same view of Oracle. The other thing I think will be interesting is not today, not tomorrow, but sooner or later, quantum computing will explode, and then you'll see another blast from the past because here comes IBM. IBM after all these years of being poo-pooed could be a leader in quantum computing.\n\n01:58 Speaker A\n\nWell, and IBM has already trading near a record, so it's already been seeing a lift from some of the transformations that company has been undergoing. Are there other sort of like old workhorses that you think people should be holding in their portfolios because they're part of this new wave?\n\n02:25 Paul\n\nYeah, another one that people had given up for dead was Cisco, right? For a long time, Cisco's growth had slowed, and the only reason that you would buy Cisco was it had a really high dividend yield for a tech stock. So you could get kind of a two-fer and have a call option on some price appreciation. However, Cisco, in this AI infrastructure world, has some mojo. And I also think Cisco might be part of the consortium that is permitted in the United States to buy Tik Tok, so that could be interesting. So, yeah, another one.\n\n03:33 Speaker A\n\nLet's get to the biggie here, and that is, of course, Nvidia. We had the recent news that they were going to be selling more, or that they were expecting to get the licenses again to sell H20s into China. What do you think is the biggest obstacle or risk for Nvidia at this point?\n\n04:04 Paul\n\nWell, we know, whether it's the Chinese or the dude that we have in the White House, that, you know, a policy could easily be changed from morning to afternoon. So I still worry about that. But in the meantime, I think things are going great there. And this quarter, Nvidia was supposed to do revenues of about $45 billion. And that was excluding $8 billion in H20 revenue. So now that we're back on, it won't go from zero back to eight. But think about it. This could add, and it should add to all the Wall Street models, 20% upside to revenues over the next year or so. So if this deal sticks, I'm always worried about these deals sticking. But obviously a boon for Nvidia, and I agree. Post this announcement, the sell side is at about a $200 price target for Nvidia. I think it's achievable.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:56:43.121923+00:00"}

Last week, signs of stickiness in consumer inflation combined with a stronger-than-expected June retail sales report and weekly unemployment filings pushed out interest rate cut bets.\n\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in just a 5% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee would cut rates in July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. A month ago, markets had priced in closer to a 13% chance.\n\n\"We expect the committee to arrive at a consensus to cut rates in September as the hawkish case weakens with the job market loosening further and no signs of tariffs spilling over into a broader inflationary trend,\" Citi chief US economist Andrew Hollenhorst wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nRead more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments\n\nIn a recent speech, Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller said the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates at its upcoming July meeting.

ASML, Salesforce, and IBM all have strong investments in AI.  Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) experienced a significant rise over the past few years and is now the 24th largest company by market capitalization globally.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/20/prediction-3-stocks-that-will-be-worth-more-than-p/", "published_at": "2025-07-20T10:00:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Palantir Technologies (PLTR 2.30%) experienced a significant rise over the past few years and is now the 24th largest company by market capitalization globally. However, through a combination of factors, I think there could be multiple stocks that pass Palantir over the coming years.\n\nThree that I think have that chance are ASML Holding (ASML 2.81%), International Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), and Salesforce (CRM -0.53%), but this list could grow if the market comes to its senses regarding Palantir's stock.\n\nPalantir's stock appears to be significantly overvalued\n\nPalantir has been on an absolute tear since the start of 2024, rising nearly 800%. However, its revenue only grew 39% year over year in the first quarter, indicating a significant disparity between stock price appreciation and actual business growth.\n\nThis shows up in the stock's valuation, which trades for 113 times sales and 244 times forward earnings.\n\nVery few companies ever reach this valuation for good reason: It's nearly impossible to live up to expectations. If we use a five-year timeline to examine Palantir's stock, let's make the following assumptions:\n\nRevenue growth of 40%.\n\nProfit margin reaches 30%.\n\nShare count remains flat.\n\nThose are three incredibly bullish assumptions -- the company hasn't achieved 40% year-over-year growth in recent quarters and would have to sustain that for five years. Also, a 30% profit margin would place it among the best software companies, and its current 18% margin is still a considerable distance from that level.\n\nLastly, management is notorious for issuing a large number of shares to employees, and its share count has increased by 7.3% since the start of 2024, indicating significant dilution.\n\nRegardless, if these heady assumptions could come true, Palantir would generate $16.8 billion in revenue and $5 billion in profits. That's huge growth from today's $3.1 billion in revenue, but it would still value the company at 67 times hypothetical 2030 earnings.\n\nA 67 multiple for forward earnings makes for a very expensive stock, and Nvidia, which is consistently growing faster than Palantir, has only a 38 forward earnings multiple right now.\n\nI think this is a fairly clear-cut case that Palantir is drastically overvalued at today's levels. Even with the most bullish assumptions, Palantir's stock would still appear overvalued five years from now, even if the company achieves incredible growth figures.\n\nAs a result, I believe the stock is ripe for a decline, and there are many other stocks (beyond the ones I mentioned) that could surpass Palantir.\n\nThis trio has a strong outlook and significantly cheaper prices\n\nASML is only slightly behind Palantir's $362 billion market cap, with a valuation of $292 billion at the time of this writing. It is a key provider of machinery in chip manufacturing, and it holds a technological monopoly with its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines.\n\nAs more chip fabrication facilities emerge to support the huge AI demand, the company will experience strong growth, which management has told investors to expect in 2026. As a result, I think ASML could easily surpass Palantir.\n\nIBM is a legacy computing business that's working to make the pivot into AI and quantum computing, which is forecast to see commercial adoption around 2030. If it becomes the go-to for this technology, the stock could be ripe for huge upside from its current $266 billion valuation.\n\nLastly, Salesforce dominates in customer relationship management software. It's also working to integrate AI into its product and maximize its profitability. Compared to many stocks on the market, it is relatively cheap and is valued at a lower level than the S&P 500, which trades for 23.7 times forward earnings.\n\nAs a final note, all three of these stocks trade for far less than Palantir's hypothetical 2030 valuation, which should be a sign for investors that the stock is unsustainably expensive. There is a near-endless list of stocks that appear to be better investments, and these three are among them.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:56:48.945368+00:00"}

This was also just shy of analyst expectations of £3.26bn.\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L) also warned that it set aside £100m of provisions amid uncertainty over US tariffs.\n\nDespite this uncertainty, Lloyds (LLOY.L) reaffirmed its guidance for the year, saying it expected to generate underlying net interest income of approximately £13.5bn in 2025.\n\nRead more: Eurozone inflation rises to 2% as expected\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Britzman said: \"It’s an important month for Lloyds (LLOY.L), not just because of next week's half-year results, but also because the Supreme Court is expected to make a judgment on the motor finance case.\n\n\"Lloyds (LLOY.L) has already taken £1.15bn in provisions and analysts expect another c.£800m over 2025, with some pencilling in another tranche next week. Lloyds (LLOY.L) has around a 14% share of the motor finance market, making it more exposed than most of its peers, so investors will be keeping a close eye on how this develops.\"\n\nHe added: \"In terms of financials, Lloyd’s (LLOY.L) giant retail banking exposure already gives it a cost advantage over peers, and investors are expecting to see more actions taken to drive cost efficiencies. Structural hedge repricing should continue to be a tailwind, too, even if rates continue to come down over the rest of the year. Strong underlying performance is expected and, if coupled with a favourable outcome from the motor finance investigation, the valuation looks relatively attractive.\"\n\nJD Wetherspoon (JDW.L) – Releases fourth quarter trading statement on Wednesday 23 July\n\nPub chain operator JD Wetherspoon (JDW.L) reported a rise in sales in the third quarter, with sunny weather in the UK boosting trade.\n\nJD Wetherspoon (JDW.L) posted a 5.6% increase in like-for-like sales in the third quarter, compared to the same period last year. Total sales rose by 5% in the quarter, which the company said were slightly less than like-for-like sales as a result of a small number of pub disposals.\n\nTim Martin, chairman of JD Wetherspoon (JDW.L), said: \"Bearing in mind that recent trading has been helped by favourable weather, the company anticipates a reasonable outcome for the financial year, notwithstanding previously reported wage and tax increases of approximately £1.2m per week.\"\n\nMartin had already warned of the impact of higher labour costs as a result of increases to employer national insurance contributions and the national minimum wage, which were announced in the autumn budget and came into effect in April.\n\nRead more: Jobs data increases odds on Bank of England interest rate cut\n\nJD Wetherspoon (JDW.L) is due to release its fourth quarter trading statement on Wednesday 23 July, giving investors a glimpse into what to expect from the company's preliminary full-year results, due out on 3 October.\n\nIn a note on Monday, Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE) analyst Tim Barrett raised his target price on JD Wetherspoon (JDW.L) from 450p to 490p but kept a \"sell\" rating on the stock.\n\n\"The pub companies are an obvious beneficiary of an unprecedented spell of dry, hot weather such as that enjoyed by the UK in June/July,\" he said. \"JDW's estate does not feature rural beer gardens (like Fuller's) but the positive footfall driver is likely to be universal, including on the high street.\"\n\nAs a result, Barrett said his team raised its assumption on full-year like-for-like sales by 50 basis points to 6.5% and its profit before tax forecast from £71m to £77m.\n\n\"However, looking ahead we expect growth to slow: margin compression and the absence of buybacks limits EPS growth to 5% in FY26,\" he added.\n\nOther companies reporting this week include:\n\nMonday 21 July\n\nVerizon Communications Inc.

The company offered predictive analytics during the game, forecasting how specific holes were likely to be played based on past information. Data-backed recaps throughout the tournament of how each hole had played were available on the APP and the website.

Leveraging the strengths of both companies, the collaboration aims to develop innovative offerings and industry-specific solutions across various verticals such as retail, consumer packaged goods, government, financial services and supply chain. Complementing IBM Copilot Runway and IBM Consulting Azure OpenAI Services, it intends to deliver customized solutions to help businesses unlock new growth opportunities, navigate complex AI, facilitate seamless cloud transition and accelerate digital transformation\n\n\n\nIBM acquired Hakkoda Inc., a prominent data consultancy provider, for an undisclosed amount in the quarter. The acquisition is expected to strengthen IBM’s data expertise and augment its capability to support clients’ AI transformation initiatives. These are likely to have translated into incremental revenues in the Software segment.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Software segment is pegged at $7.48 billion, while our model projects revenues of $7.52 billion.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite solid hybrid cloud and AI traction, IBM faces stiff competition from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure.

The research uses both classical computing and quantum computing methods to tackle increasingly complex problems.\n\nQuantum computing was used to complement and extend the capabilities of classical algorithms in identifying “biological mechanisms involved in a disease” as a means of developing mRNA medicines, according to the report. That involved “mapping” the astronomical number of ways that mRNA proteins can fold, Sarah Sheldon, senior manager of applied quantum science at IBM, told CIO Upside.\n\n“While they have very good solutions for this today with classical computers, it’s something that gets harder and harder as you look at more complex problems,” Sheldon said. “As this mRNA sequence link gets longer, it gets exponentially harder.”\n\nThe work, she said, plays well to quantum’s strength in optimization:\n\nIn the context of medicine, this means that quantum can more rapidly tackle exponentially complex research in drug discovery. “We’re pushing the boundaries of the size of the problems we can look at with quantum,” said Sheldon.\n\nAnd quantum is an “interdisciplinary field,” she added. The next step is figuring out how to translate these optimization and efficiency gains into other domains. The tech is a natural fit for things like chemistry, materials science and high-energy physics, she noted.\n\n“It’s really about finding the right problems for the algorithms that we have,” she said.\n\nThere are still plenty of barriers to scaling this tech, including its sensitivity to environmental factors such as temperature and “noise” that can knock it out of the delicate superposition on which it depends. But as the tech develops at an increasingly fast rate with the attention of tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM, the job now is to figure out how to best put it to use.\n\n“We work in parallel,” she said. “We always are trying to build bigger and better hardware, improving the quality as well as the size of our systems … And then, at the same time, we keep working on algorithm development.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:57:13.185043+00:00"}

Nevertheless, the company continues to benefit from its progress in building an interconnected shopping experience, synergies from the SRS acquisition, expansion of its Pro ecosystem, strategic digital investments, and new store openings.\n\nThese factors contributed to robust top-line growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by increased engagement in Spring-related purchases and smaller-scale home improvement projects.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)\n\nIBM'sshares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+54.8% vs. +16.8%).

This surge reflects growing investor confidence in D-Wave Quantum’s differentiated path, backed by breakthrough achievements including the world's first demonstration of quantum supremacy on a real-world problem, record revenues from its Advantage2 system sale and a robust $304 million cash position. As its second-quarter earnings release date approaches, QBTS appears poised to extend its lead as the only pure-play quantum company translating scientific milestones into commercial production, and closing in on profitability faster than its peers.\n\nThree-Month Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMajor Growth Drivers That Likely Propelled Q2 Performance\n\nStrong Financial Base & Profitability Path: D-Wave closed the first quarter with record revenues of more than $15 million, a 509% year-over-year increase, largely driven by the commercial sale of its Advantage annealing quantum system to the Julich Supercomputing Centre and growth in its quantum computing-as-a-service (QCaaS) and professional services segments.\n\nNet loss narrowed to $5.4 million, the lowest since going public, highlighting improved cost discipline and operating leverage. This trend aligns with the company's previously stated expectation of becoming the first pure-play quantum computing company to achieve sustained profitability, outperforming direct peers like IonQ IONQ and Rigetti (RGTI) in capital efficiency.\n\nAs of March 31, 2025, the company had $304 million in cash following successful ATM offerings and early loan repayment, with nearly $295 million raised in just 23 trading days. Management believes this capital is sufficient to achieve profitability without major dilution. Coupled with high-margin QCaaS revenues and growing customer adoption, D-Wave is well-positioned for scalable, capital-efficient growth. These strengths are likely to show through in the upcoming Q2 results.\n\nCommercial Launch of Advantage2 & Quantum Supremacy Milestone: During the months of the second quarter,D-Wave marked a major technical and commercial inflection point with the official launch of its sixth-generation Advantage2 annealing quantum system. Advantage2 offers over 4,400 qubits, 20-way qubit connectivity, 40% higher energy scale and 75% noise reduction, making it the company’s most production-ready system yet for solving real-world optimization problems.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:57:20.141111+00:00"}

It may seem like a neat distinction—and will undoubtedly be cold comfort to those who lost their jobs—but these experts say that these companies need the funds to make big bets on AI. In part, they’re hiring a new workforce. The tech CEOs who are making the layoff decisions are largely offering a darker worldview, confirming that automation is coming for the white-collar workforce.\n\nMicrosoft‘s AI ambitions\n\nMicrosoft has been at the center of this year’s layoff wave, letting go of nearly 6,000 employees in May, followed by another 9,000 in July—amounting to almost 4% of its global workforce.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella has openly discussed the company’s AI transformation, revealing that AI now writes 20% to 30% of Microsoft’s code. This shift has sparked debate about the future need for human engineers, as the company reallocates resources to fund an $80 billion AI infrastructure push this year.\n\nFinancial strategy and restructuring\n\nIndustry experts like Deedy Das of Menlo Ventures argue that the layoffs are less about AI replacing workers and more about freeing up capital for AI investments.\n\nTech commentator Wes Roth echoed the sentiment: “This isn’t about AI replacing humans yet—it’s about restructuring to fund AI initiatives.” Microsoft’s approach is mirrored across the sector, with companies including Amazon flattening management layers and prioritizing technical roles over administrative ones.\n\nDas and Roth did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIBM has cut around 8,000 jobs in HR and other departments, as AI tools take over routine administrative tasks. However, the company is simultaneously hiring more engineers and salespeople, signaling a shift toward roles that require creativity and complex decision-making.\n\nGoogle and Meta have also made significant cuts, with Meta laying off 3,600 employees at the start of the year and Google reducing hundreds of roles in its Android, Pixel, and Chrome teams. Both companies cite the need to streamline operations and invest in AI as key reasons.\n\nPwC and Chegg Inc. have joined the layoff trend, with PwC cutting approximately 1,500 jobs and Chegg reducing its workforce by 22% as students increasingly turn to free AI-powered study tools.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:57:21.973628+00:00"}

Even the S&P 500’s robust 18.8% climb during the same period has lagged behind IonQ’s performance. This momentum reflects investor enthusiasm around IonQ’s strategic direction, particularly its leadership in quantum networking and government-backed projects.\n\nBeyond Capella, IonQ has also forged key partnerships that reinforce its long-term vision. Its collaboration with ID Quantique, a leader in quantum-safe cryptography, and its quantum networking contracts with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security highlight the growing demand for IonQ’s technology in national security and enterprise use cases. These alliances help validate IonQ’s platform and increase the likelihood of recurring revenue through long-term government engagements. With security concerns escalating globally and government agencies seeking resilient communications infrastructure, IonQ’s offering stands to benefit from rising demand in the public sector.\n\nThe completed acquisition of Capella Space is not just a strategic expansion—it marks a foundational step toward realizing IonQ’s quantum Internet ambitions. By integrating Capella’s space-based infrastructure with its quantum hardware and software stack, IonQ is developing a QKD network that promises tamper-proof communication channels between satellites and ground stations. This could prove essential for national defense, cybersecurity, and even financial institutions where absolute data security is critical. This space-based QKD architecture would also support new capabilities in Earth observation, enhancing SAR imaging with quantum encryption for ultra-secure data transmission. IonQ’s move effectively positions it as the first player in a new category: quantum-enabled geospatial intelligence. According to IonQ CEO Niccolo de Masi, the integration will not only enhance commercial applications but also expand the company’s role in global defense and intelligence operations.\n\nIonQ. Inc. IONQ, a pioneer in quantum computing, is setting its sights far beyond Earth’s surface. With the recent acquisition of Capella Space, a satellite technology firm known for synthetic aperture radar (“SAR”) imaging, IonQ is accelerating its bold vision to build the first global space-based quantum key distribution (“QKD”) network. The deal positions IonQ to not only lead in quantum computing but also in quantum-secure communications—a sector expected to become increasingly vital for both commercial and defense applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nIONQ 3-Month Share Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nYet with this rally comes a note of caution. The stock is currently trading at a lofty forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 97.61, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 3.84. While IonQ operates in a highly specialized frontier market, the steep premium raises questions about whether the stock has already priced in too much of the company’s long-term potential.\n\nIONQ Valuation\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIONQ’s Revenue Outlook and Earnings Trend\n\nDespite the sky-high valuation, the company’s growth trajectory appears robust. For 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue implies a near doubling year over year, at 97.3% growth. That said, analysts have become slightly more conservative in their projections for profitability. The consensus estimate for 2025’s loss per share has widened over the past 30 days, although it still points to a much narrower loss than the $1.56 per share loss reported a year ago.\n\n\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis mixed sentiment suggests that investors are optimistic about revenue expansion but remain cautious about when IonQ will turn the corner on profitability. The company continues to invest heavily in R&D and infrastructure, particularly in its quantum-as-a-service (QaaS) and networking initiatives, which may delay earnings upside but could secure a first-mover advantage.\n\nChallenges Remain on the Path to Profitability for IonQ\n\nWhile IonQ’s technological edge is compelling, the company is still in an early stage of commercial maturity. The quantum computing industry is years away from widespread enterprise adoption, and IonQ must demonstrate its ability to transition from R&D-driven partnerships to scalable, recurring commercial revenue. In the meantime, its burn rate and elevated valuation could limit investor patience if near-term milestones fall short.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the intensifying competition from peers like International Business Machines Corporation IBM, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, and Rigetti Computing, Inc. RGTI could challenge IonQ’s leadership if those firms scale more quickly or secure broader ecosystems. IBM’s extensive hardware roadmap and global quantum network make it a key rival, while Microsoft’s Azure Quantum is gaining traction with hybrid solutions and cloud accessibility. Both IBM and Microsoft have broader platforms and deeper enterprise reach. Rigetti, though smaller, competes closely with IonQ in hardware innovation. While IonQ’s space-based QKD provides a differentiator, IBM and Microsoft, mentioned repeatedly in enterprise discussions, remain the more established players with vast resources and client ecosystems.\n\nConclusion\n\nIonQ is making bold moves that reflect its ambition to shape the quantum future, from terrestrial computing to orbital communications. The Capella Space acquisition solidifies its leadership in quantum-secure networking and opens a new chapter in space-based infrastructure. With accelerating government interest, a clear roadmap toward the quantum Internet, and strong revenue prospects, IonQ offers a compelling growth narrative.\n\n\n\nHowever, with its valuation already stretched and earnings still in the red, investors should remain cautious. IonQ currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which aligns with a prudent approach — hold the stock and monitor execution, especially as the company integrates Capella and ramps up commercial applications.

These three household-name business titans offer payouts up to 7.2%.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/16/3-dividend-stocks-to-hold-for-the-next-20-years/", "published_at": "2025-07-16T11:03:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Looking for dividend yields that crush the market average in the long run? These three household-name business titans offer payouts up to 7.2%.\n\nThe average dividend yield for the S&P 500 index is just 1.2% right now. That's well below the 1.4% average over the past five years, and even further behind an average 10-year yield of 1.7%.\n\nIt's good news that the leading market index is on the rise. At the same time, soaring stock prices have the opposite mathematical effect on dividend yields. In this market, S&P 500 funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 1.08%) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY 1.07%) become less effective for income-oriented investors.\n\nBut you shouldn't give up on dividend stocks. Look around and you'll find a plethora of strong yields just below Wall Street's surface. From the tech sector to household-name consumer goods, it's still easy to find respectable dividend yields tied to cash-machine businesses. For starters, you should consider buying shares of International Business Machines (IBM -0.80%), Coca-Cola (KO -0.02%), and Altria Group (MO 0.52%) today and hold them for 20 years or more.\n\nWith yields as high as 7.2%, these business titans should serve your income portfolio well in the long term. You should see serious dividend payouts in the next five years, even greater cash-sharing returns over a full decade, and truly game-changing dividend profits in 20 years or more.\n\nIBM turned strategic pain into dividend gain\n\nIBM has been around for more than a century, surviving a plethora of economic disasters along the way. More recently, Big Blue traded in its full-service enterprise computing strategy for a tighter focus on what it called \"strategic imperatives.\" That was a painful transition, reducing IBM's top-line revenues and driving share prices lower for many years.\n\nBut the strategy shift is finally paying off. IBM's strategic imperatives included heavy investments in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). When the game-changing Red Hat buyout closed in 2019, IBM was ready to thrive three years later, when ChatGPT inspired the massive AI boom.\n\nAnd IBM's dividends never stopped flowing. Big Blue's annual yield stands at a decent 2.4% today -- about double the S&P 500 average. That's a downtrend, mind you, since IBM's stock has been soaring in recent months. Over the past five years, IBM's yield averaged 4.4%.\n\nThe company's dividend increases have been merely symbolic since 2020, but I expect the payouts to accelerate pretty soon. IBM is just waiting for the ongoing AI bonanza to boost its free cash flows, and that's already happening.\n\nCoca-Cola keeps the dividend checks flowing\n\nCoca-Cola is an official dividend king, with an unbroken streak of payout increases across the last 63 years. The iconic beverage company has been a mainstay for dividend investors since forever, thanks to its unshakable cash machine of a business model.\n\nThe company largely makes and sells beverage concentrate to a global network of bottling partners. It also ships fountain syrups directly to food service customers, skipping the bottler step. Concentrate is a higher-volume business that accounted for 85% of Coke's total sales last year, but the \"finished product\" category of syrup sales carries a wider profit margin.\n\nAll that being said, Coca-Cola stock offers a 2.9% dividend yield today. If you invested $10,000 in Coke stock five years ago, the position would be worth $15,400 today. Reinvesting the dividends in more shares along the way would have brought a total return of $17,970.\n\nBack out the $10,000 investment on both sides of the investor return equations, and you'll see a $7,970 profit with total returns versus $5,390 in plain price gains. That's a 48% increase in actual gains. For the S&P 500 funds, the increase from dividend reinvestments stopped at 15% over the same time span.\n\nAltria proves that old habits die hard\n\nAltria combines some of the finest qualities of IBM and Coca-Cola. The company was incorporated in the 1920s as Philip Morris & Co, and was already a centennial veteran of the tobacco trade at that point. After dabbling in food products and beer-brewing along the way, Altria is back to its tobacco roots in the 2020s. That's the IBM connection, with many decades of successful operations under Altria's belt.\n\nIt's also a dividend king like Coca-Cola, with 55 years of consistent annual payout increases. The current dividend yield stands at 7.2%, giving Altria one of the three most generous yields in the S&P 500.\n\nThe times, they are a-changing, as consumers seek alternatives to classic cigarettes. However, Altria is ready to roll with the punches. The company realizes that dangerous smoking is going out of style, and aims to replace its old core business with products in the \"tobacco harm reduction\" area. Altria's tag line these days is \"moving beyond smoking.\"\n\nAs a result, alternative products such as vapes, moist smokeless tobacco, and nicotine pouches accounted for 12% of Altria's total revenues last year. That's up from 7% a decade ago.\n\nAnd Altria's generous dividends make a significant difference to investor returns. Remember how Coca-Cola's total returns jumped 48% above the basic price gains over the past five years? Do the same math for Altria, and you'll see a far greater boost of 162% instead. Altria investments are all about the lucrative dividend payouts.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:57:29.047739+00:00"}

IonQ is battling larger companies like IBM and Alphabet in an industry that could still be many years away from commercial viability.  Two prime examples are Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ).", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/16/2-risky-stocks-that-could-plunge/", "published_at": "2025-07-16T09:20:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "The major stock indices are currently hovering around their all-time highs despite extreme levels of economic uncertainty. U.S. tariff policy remains erratic and unpredictable, and the risk of a recession is still very real. While there are no truly \"safe\" stocks, there are plenty of stocks that far riskier than others is such an environment. Two prime examples are Carvana (CVNA -0.04%) and IonQ (IONQ -4.36%).\n\nCarvana: A sky-high valuation\n\nOnline used-car retailer Carvana has seemingly staged an impressive comeback. After a debt restructuring deal in 2023 that reduced the company's outstanding debt, Carvana has grown total retail units sold, boosted its per-vehicle gross profit, and cut down on per-vehicle expenses. In the first quarter of 2025, the company sold nearly 134,000 retail units and reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%.\n\nCarvana has set an audacious goal of selling 3 million retail vehicles annually within five to 10 years, along with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.5%. To reach that target, the company would need to increase its current retail unit annual run rate by a factor of 6. For comparison, CarMax sold around 766,000 retail vehicles in fiscal 2025.\n\nHere's the problem: Carvana's valuation practically requires the company to hit or exceed that goal. The stock currently trades for around 110 times earnings, and those earnings are currently inflated by gains on certain warrants. Carvana will need to greatly increase its unit sales over the next few years while maintaining or improving its per-vehicle profit margins for this valuation to make sense.\n\nWhat could go wrong? The used car market is cyclical and highly sensitive to the state of the economy. There's also a question about financing. Famed short-seller Jim Chanos has called Carvana a \"subprime lender,\" claiming the company is making money in finance, not selling cars. If it turns out that Carvana is being overly aggressive in making loans to push up unit volumes and revenue, things could unravel quickly in an economic downturn.\n\nShares of Carvana have rocketed higher over the past two years, but investors should be careful with this pricey stock.\n\nIonQ: A speculative quantum computing play\n\nQuantum computing has the potential to be the next big thing in the technology industry, but that doesn't mean that every quantum computing stock will be a winner. Giants like IBM and Alphabet are pushing forward in quantum computing, and IBM now sees a path to a large fault-tolerate system by 2029. IBM has also already generated $1 billion in signings related to quantum computing, and its decades of research in the field gives it a significant advantage.\n\nThis doesn't mean that smaller quantum computing companies like IonQ can't succeed, but it does stack the deck against them. Here's the problem: Commercially viable quantum computing systems are four to five years away under the absolute best-case scenario. IBM and others have been working on quantum computing technology for decades, and there remain major challenges around error correction that still must be overcome. IonQ needs to survive long enough for the technology to mature.\n\nAs long as quantum computing stocks remain in nosebleed territory, IonQ can easily sell stock and fund its operations. Earlier this month, the company announced a $1 billion equity offering, which gives it plenty of financial firepower for the time being. However, the company reported a free cash flow loss of nearly $130 million in 2024, a number that's been growing each year. IonQ's net loss for the year was a whopping $332 million.\n\nIf the hype around quantum computing fades, or if the broader stock market declines, IonQ could have more trouble in the future raising the cash it needs to keep the lights on. And if it takes longer than expected for quantum computing to reach maturity, meaningful revenue could be many years away. With just $43 million in revenue last year and a market capitalization topping $12 billion, IonQ is a risky way to bet on quantum computing.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:57:30.705674+00:00"}

The company’s growth is expected to be aided by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long term. IBM has extended its collaboration with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to scale AI workloads and agentic AI applications. Per the latest agreement, IBM aims to launch a content-aware storage (CAS) capability for its hybrid cloud infrastructure offering (dubbed IBM Fusion) and expand its watsonx integrations with NVIDIA while introducing new IBM Consulting capabilities. The CAS capability will enable firms to extract the hidden meaning of unstructured data for inferencing to scale and enhance AI applications without compromising security. The integration of watsonx with NVIDIA Inference Microservices will offer firms greater accessibility to leading AI models across multiple cloud environments. IBM’s watsonx platform is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. This enterprise-ready AI and data platform delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. Despite solid hybrid cloud and AI traction, IBM is facing stiff competition from AWS and Microsoft Corporation ’s MSFT Azure. Increasing pricing pressure is eroding margins, and profitability has trended down over the years, barring occasional spikes. The company’s ongoing, heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud is a challenging task. Weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain significant concerns.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation IBM and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN are leading players in the global cloud computing industry. IBM offers cloud and data solutions that aid enterprises in digital transformation. In addition to hybrid cloud services, the company provides advanced information technology solutions, computer systems, quantum computing and supercomputing solutions, enterprise software, storage systems and microelectronics. On the other hand, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) is the world’s most comprehensive and widely adopted on-demand cloud computing platform, offering more than 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers, including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises and leading government agencies, are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile and innovate faster. It reportedly offers the widest variety of databases that are purpose-built for different types of applications to enable subscribers to choose the right tool for the job. With a focus on hybrid cloud and AI (artificial intelligence), both IBM and Amazon are strategically positioned in the cloud infrastructure market and have the wherewithal to cater to the evolving demands of business enterprises. Let us delve a little deeper into the companies’ competitive dynamics to understand which of the two is relatively better placed in the industry.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Case for Amazon\n\nAmazon is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers. The expanding customer base of AWS, driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid Amazon's dominance in the global cloud space. Amazon’s strategic expansion of its Bedrock platform has positioned it as a frontrunner in the enterprise AI race. Amazon Bedrock has emerged as a game-changing, fully managed service that offers enterprises seamless access to high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies. The platform's recent developments, including automated reasoning checks and multi-agent collaboration capabilities, address critical challenges in AI adoption while opening new revenue streams for Amazon's cloud division.\n\n\n\nThe company is investing heavily in AI infrastructure, including the development of custom AI silicon like Trainium 2, which offers 30-40% better price performance than competing GPU-powered instances. Amazon aims to extend AWS’ AI and machine learning (ML) capabilities to facilitate improved decision-making. It intends to expand its global infrastructure for faster and more reliable service with low latency and maximum availability. From cloud-native applications and AI-driven solutions to edge computing and sustainability initiatives, AWS is likely to push the limits in the realm of cloud computing technology.\n\n\n\nHowever, the substantial capital expenditure required for AI infrastructure expansion may weigh on margins in the coming quarters. In addition, while AWS' growth remains impressive, the company faces capacity constraints in AI services that could limit near-term growth potential. Moreover, AWS has historically been less open to hybrid cloud than rivals like Microsoft Azure, which integrates well with on-premise environments via tools like Azure Arc. Data localization laws and stricter regulatory requirements create friction for AWS' global expansion, while stringent government scrutiny in regions like the EU and China adds compliance complexity.\n\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for IBM & AMZN?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for IBM’s 2025 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 5.5% and 6%, respectively.

Pega Cloud Annual Contract Value (ACV) surged 23% year over year to $701 million, reflecting rising enterprise adoption of the platform. ACV growth is expected to remain robust thanks to ongoing digital transformation, strong adoption of Pega GenAI Blueprint and case-based pricing approach.\n\n\n\nPegasystems recently announced Pega Blueprint capabilities that include the usage of agentic AI to ingest, analyze and convert a wide array of legacy system assets, including videos, documentation, UI screens, technical files, and source code, into modern applications much faster. Pega Blueprint, the generative AI-powered workflow design agent, accelerates application development projects from months to weeks, and the latest capabilities harness digital transformation much faster.\n\n\n\nRising enterprise demand for Pegasystems’ flexible, term-based licensing model, which provides a faster, more scalable path to digital adoption, is a key catalyst. Pega GenAI Blueprint, which focuses on cross-sell and upsell, as well as shifting existing clients to Pega Cloud, is a major growth driver. Pega Cloud ACV is expected to expand in the coming years.\n\n\n\nThe company’s expanding enterprise clientele in key verticals, including financial services, insurance, telecommunications, health care, manufacturing and public sector. The introduction of the Blueprint for Government Efficiency Toolkit, a generative AI offering that helps public sector agencies accelerate digital transformation and increase efficiency, is noteworthy. Pegasystems recently achieved FedRAMP High Authority to Operate (ATO) status for its suite of generative AI solutions. This will enable U.S. federal agencies to deploy AI-powered tools like Pega Coach, Pega Knowledge Buddy, Pega Automate and Pega developer agents securely, thereby expanding PEGA’s federal footprint.\n\n\n\nPegasystems now expects revenues of $1.7 billion for 2025, higher than the previous guidance of $1.6 billion due to growing ACV, momentum in Pega GenAI Blueprint and an expanding market. Pegasystems achieved the rule of 40 (ACV growth + free cash flow margin) in 2024. The company now expects gross margin to hit 80% in the 2027-2028 timeframe.

While this premium reflects investor optimism about Rigetti’s potential in the emerging quantum computing space, it also positions the stock ahead of many of its peers.\n\nInternational Business Machines IBM, a diversified technology leader with substantial quantum R&D, holds a P/B ratio of 9.78X.

If he said no one understood quantum mechanics, then no one understood quantum mechanics.\n\nI bring this up for two reasons. First, quantum computing -- one of the hottest technologies around right now -- is based on quantum mechanics. Second, Warren Buffett has been credited with saying, \"Never invest in a business you cannot understand.\"\n\nYou'd think that Buffett wouldn't have any position in quantum computing stocks. However, that's not the case. Instead, the legendary investor owns the following three quantum computing stocks -- even though they don't show up in any of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.90%) (BRK.B 1.17%) regulatory filings.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nYou won't find Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%)listed among Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, though. The \"Oracle of Omaha\" has a stake in Alphabet, though, via New England Asset Management (NEAM). In 1998, Berkshire acquired General Re, which had acquired NEAM three years earlier. Any stock in NEAM's portfolio is, by extension, a Buffett stock.\n\nAlphabet has made multiple advances in quantum computing. The company's Google Quantum AI unit announced in 2019 that it had achieved quantum supremacy, which means a quantum computer performed a calculation that would take the fastest classical supercomputer a ridiculously long amount of time to handle. In 2023, Google Quantum AI took a giant step forward in quantum error correction.\n\nThe company still has four more milestones to check off on its quantum computing roadmap. Google Quantum AI director of hardware Julian Kelly told CNBC earlier this year, \"We think we're about five years out from a real breakout, kind of practical application that you can only solve on a quantum computer.\"\n\n2. IBM\n\nSeveral years ago, Buffett bought shares of IBM (IBM -0.80%) for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Although he later exited the position, he still has a stake in the technology pioneer thanks to NEAM. The Berkshire subsidiary owns 20,285 shares of IBM.\n\nLike Google Quantum AI, IBM has a well-defined quantum computing roadmap. The company has been working on quantum computing since 2016. However, IBM began following its roadmap in 2020.\n\nBig Blue doesn't lack confidence in its capabilities. IBM stated in a blog post that it's \"the only quantum computing organization in the world that will be capable of running quantum programs at the scale of hundreds of logical qubits and millions of quantum gates by the end of the decade.\" The company believes that it \"has the most viable path to realize fault-tolerant quantum computing.\"\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nAlthough Buffett has been friends with Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) co-founder Bill Gates for years, he never added the software stock to Berkshire's portfolio. NEAM, on the other hand, continues to have a stake in Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft argues that its quantum computing unit is \"leading the industry with advanced technology that accelerates scientific discovery.\" Earlier this year, the company introduced its Majorana 1 quantum chip. This chip is based on an architecture that Microsoft expects will lead to quantum computers that can solve \"meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades.\"\n\nShould you own these quantum computing stocks, too?\n\nWhile Buffett probably doesn't understand quantum computing and wouldn't choose to invest in quantum computing stocks, he nonetheless owns positions in Alphabet, IBM, and Microsoft thanks to NEAM. Should you own these quantum computing stocks, too? I think all three are pretty good picks, but not primarily because of their quantum computing efforts.\n\nAlphabet admittedly faces some challenges, especially with two antitrust decisions going against it over the last year. However, artificial intelligence (AI) is a game-changer for the company. Google Cloud is growing by leaps and bounds as customers build and deploy AI models in the cloud. Google Search is evolving with the integration of generative AI. Alphabet's Waymo unit could be in the early stages of conquering a massive robotaxi market.\n\nIBM isn't the 800-pound gorilla of technology it once was. However, the company still has tremendous opportunities with its AI products. IBM has also increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years, something that should be appealing to income investors.\n\nMicrosoft also stands to benefit greatly from AI. It's the second largest cloud service provider. The company has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 technology throughout its product suite. Agentic AI could be an especially big growth driver for Microsoft.\n\nWhat about quantum computing? I think it's certainly an important wild card for each of these three companies -- even if you don't understand the technology.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:57:47.453706+00:00"}
