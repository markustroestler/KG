AI is gaining popularity thanks to multimodal learning and growing context awareness. The emergence of Gen AI and Agentic AI has further enhanced AI’s capabilities, making it a key driver of efficiency, automation and innovation. Significant improvements in computing hardware (GPUs and TPUs) are allowing the development of more complex AI models. The growing number of high-speed data centers worldwide, which require ultra-fast Internet that 5G promises to deliver, is a tailwind. Increased connectivity and use of technology in consumer electronics through IoT, AI, robotics, AR/VR and others further set the momentum for 5G.\n\nThe Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry comprises companies that provide a wide range of semiconductor technologies. Their offerings include packaging and test services, wafer cleaning, factory automation, face detection and image-recognition capabilities to develop smart and connected products. The industry participants primarily cater to end markets that include consumer electronics, communications, computing, industrial and automotive. The companies are increasing their spending on research and development to stay afloat in an era of technological advancements and changing industry standards. The industry is experiencing solid demand for advanced electronic equipment, which is helping its participants increase their investments in cost-effective process technologies.\n\nThe Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry is suffering from macroeconomic challenges, end-market volatility, broad-based inventory correction and growing geopolitical tensions. Tariffs on trade partners, including China, are expected to hurt the industry’s prospects. However, industry players are benefiting from the growing proliferation of AI, Generative AI (Gen AI), IoT, Machine Learning (ML) and industrial revolution 4.0 (which focuses on interconnectivity and automation). These have turned out to be boons for industry players like Broadcom and Applied Materials . Increasing demand for AI-supportive chips from hyperscalers is a major growth driver. The growing demand for high-volume consumer electronic devices, including digital media players, smartphones, tablets, efficient packaging, machine vision solutions and robotics, should continue to drive the industry’s growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand: Smart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform functions like face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high levels of processing power, speed and memory and low power consumption, as well as better graphics processors and solutions, which bode well for the industry. Graphic solutions help increase the speed of rendering images and improve image resolution and color definition.\n\nProspects Around Advanced Packaging Robust: The increasing demand for miniaturization, greater functionality, lower power consumption, and improved thermal and electrical performance are driving the demand for semiconductor packaging and test technologies. The growing requirement for advanced packaging is gaining traction in the semiconductor industry, which is a key catalyst for industry participants.\n\nComplex Process Drives Demand: The requirement for faster, more powerful and energy-efficient semiconductors is expected to increase rapidly with the robust adoption of cloud computing, IoT and AI. Semiconductor manufacturers are primarily looking to maximize manufacturing yields at lower costs, making semiconductor manufacturing processes more complex and driving the demand for solutions offered by industry participants. The rapid adoption of IoT-supported factory automation solutions is another contributing factor.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #182, which places it in the bottom 25% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bearish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since April 30, 2025, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have moved down 3.6%.\n\nGiven the bearish prospects, there are only a few stocks that you can consider for your portfolio. However, before we present the stocks, let us look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Outperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry has outperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite and surpassed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector in the past year.\n\nThe industry has appreciated 51.5% over this period compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 29.1% and the S&P 500’s appreciation of 20.3%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing electronics semiconductor stocks, the industry is currently trading at 34.32X versus the S&P 500 and the sector’s 22.69X and 28.15X, respectively.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 34.32X and as low as 11.05X, with the median being 19.7X.\n\n2 Electronics Semiconductor Stocks to Buy\n\nBroadcom: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is benefiting from strong momentum fueled by growth in AI semiconductors and continued success with its VMware integration. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStrong demand for Broadcom’s networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs) has been noteworthy. AVGO’s AI segment benefits from custom accelerators and advanced networking technology that support large-scale AI deployments with improved performance and efficiency. Broadcom expects third-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 60% year over year to $5.1 billion. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. As of the fiscal second quarter, roughly 87% of Broadcom’s largest 10,000 customers have adopted VMware Cloud Foundation.\n\nBroadcom stock has appreciated 31% year to date (YTD). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO’s fiscal 2025 earnings has been steady at $6.63 per share over the past 60 days.\n\nApplied Materials: Another Zacks Rank #2 stock, AMAT is benefiting from strength in the Semiconductor Systems, owing to a rebound in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the foundry logic space.\n\nSolid momentum in the subscription and display businesses is a plus for Applied Materials. The company’s strong position in IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensors (ICAPS) has helped it gain market share. AMAT’s diversified portfolio remains its key growth driver.\n\nApplied Materials has appreciated 16.2% YTD. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMAT’s fiscal 2025 earnings has declined by a penny to $9.46 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

It's not like dividend stocks completely faltered during that stretch, though. Many performed pretty well during that period, too, as evidenced by the performance of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG 0.97%) over the course of the past five years.\n\nThen and now\n\nThe graphic below tells the tale. Had you invested $1,000 in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation fund in August of 2020, today you'd have $1,640 plus all the dividends it paid in the meantime. And if you'd reinvested those dividend payments in more shares of VIG, your $1,000 investment would be worth $1,800 now.\n\nThe dividend payments for this exchange-traded fund (ETF) have also grown during this time. July's quarterly payment of $0.87 per share is well above the same quarter's payment of only $0.60 in 2020, in line with this fund's actual dividend growth during this five-year period.\n\nNot the best ETF for dividend income\n\nIn this vein, you should know that while this Vanguard fund prioritizes reliable dividend growth over high yields or capital appreciation, Vanguard Dividend Appreciation also offers the latter at least as well as most other dividend-oriented ETFs. Only the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM 1.10%) has fared better for the past five years, and only by a slight margin.\n\nCredit a quirk of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF's underlying S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, mostly. It excludes the highest-yielding one-fourth of tickers that would otherwise be eligible for inclusion in the index. Standard & Poor's fears these high yields suggest their particular companies may be facing growth headwinds.\n\nRemoving these highest-yielding names from the mix, of course, also dials back this ETF's average dividend yield. VIG's trailing yield right now is a little less than 1.7%, which isn't much for anyone looking for above-average investment income. Point being, this fund is best used as a defensive, quality-capital-growth holding.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:09:40.327568+00:00"}

It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #182, which places it in the bottom 25% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\n\n\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bearish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\n\n\nThe industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since April 30, 2025, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have moved down 3.6%.\n\n\n\nGiven the bearish prospects, there are only a few stocks that you can consider for your portfolio. However, before we present the stocks, let us look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Outperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry has outperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite and surpassed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector in the past year.\n\n\n\nThe industry has appreciated 51.5% over this period compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 29.1% and the S&P 500’s appreciation of 20.3%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing electronics semiconductor stocks, the industry is currently trading at 34.32X versus the S&P 500 and the sector’s 22.69X and 28.15X, respectively.\n\n\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 34.32X and as low as 11.05X, with the median being 19.7X, as the charts below show.\n\nForward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Electronics Semiconductor Stocks to Buy\n\nBroadcom: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is benefiting from strong momentum fueled by growth in AI semiconductors and continued success with its VMware integration.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this chipmaker a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Broadcom Inc. is 21.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 36.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 9.9%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Broadcom Inc. is 36.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -7%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.2%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:09:49.075493+00:00"}

AEC product line posted double-digit sequential growth in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025. The demand for AECs is increasing as ZeroFlap AECs offer more than 100 times improved reliability than laser-based optical solutions. This made AECs an increasingly attractive option for data center applications, contributing to the new expansion of AEC usage and further solidifying Credo Technology’s position in the market. With demonstration of PCIe Gen6 AECs and increasing hyperscaler interest, this product line is expected to remain a growth engine going forward. Strength in the optical business, particularly DSPs, is another key catalyst. CRDO achieved revenue targets for this business in fiscal 2025 and expects expansion of customer diversity across lane rates, port speeds and applications to accelerate revenue growth going ahead. CRDO announced that it achieved a key 800-gig transceiver DSP design win and unveiled ultra-low-power 100-gig per lane optical DSPs built on 5-nanometer technology. CRDO highlighted that this particular suite, including full DSP and linear receive optics or LRO variants, sets “new industry benchmarks for power efficiency”. CRDO expects its 3-nanometer 200-gig-per-lane optical DSP (port speeds up to 1.6 terabits per second) to boost the industry’s transition to 200-gig lane speeds. Supplementing these businesses is CRDO’s PCIe retimers and Ethernet retimers business. This particular product line continues to witness customer interest, especially for scale-out networks in AI servers. CRDO highlighted that the retimer business delivered “robust” performance in both the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2025, driven by 50 gig and 100 gig per lane Ethernet solutions.\n\nCRDO stock hit a new 52-week high of $121.50 last week. It gained 0.5% last session and closed trading at $120.41. After a steep run, investors are likely to contemplate whether CRDO still offers attractive upside or if expectations are running ahead of fundamentals. Let’s unpack CRDO’s pros and cons to ascertain the way forward.\n\nCredo Technology Group Holding Ltd CRDO has been an impressive performer in the semiconductor space, surging 79.1% year to date. The rally has been fueled by strong AI-driven demand and high investor enthusiasm for companies enabling next-generation data center connectivity. It has outperformed the Electronic-Semiconductors and the broader Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 19.8% and 13.5%, respectively. The S&P 500 Composite is up 8.5% over the same time frame. CRDO’s stock price appreciation is also much higher than peers like Broadcom Inc . AVGO, Marvell Technology MRVL and Cirrus Logic, Inc. CRUS. Broadcom and Cirrus Logic have gained 31.5% and 4.2%, respectively while Marvell has declined 30%.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis growing demand underscores the increasing importance of high-performance solutions in the rapidly expanding AI server market. Shift to 100 gig per lane solutions and higher demand for system-level expertise and software capabilities for dealing with AI-optimized architectures bode well for CRDO’s retimer business.\n\n\n\nStrong AI-driven demand and solid execution continue to fuel momentum. For fiscal 2026, Credo anticipates revenues to surpass $800 million, implying more than 85% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow at less than half the revenue growth rate, driving non-GAAP net margin to nearly 40%.\n\n\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the company expects revenues between $185 million and $195 million, up 12% sequentially at the midpoint. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $190 million, suggesting growth of 218.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 64-66%, with operating expenses between $54 million and $56 million.\n\nCRDO Faces Several Challenges\n\nIncreasing market competition and macroeconomic uncertainties amid tariff troubles may impact CRDO’s growth trajectory. Credo competes with semiconductor giants like Broadcom and Marvell Technology.\n\n\n\nWhile hyperscaler demand is a growth driver, it also poses risks. In the fiscal fourth quarter, three customers contributed more than 10% of revenues each, and management expects this pattern to persist. A change in spending or in-house solution from one of these customers could materially affect revenue numbers. Also, two new hyperscaler ramps, a key part of fiscal 2026 guidance, are not expected until the year's second half. This leaves the first half dependent on existing customers, raising the risk that delays in the ramps could lead to a guidance miss.\n\n\n\nMoreover, CRDO’s bullish narrative hinges on AI investment. While these segments are currently experiencing high growth, they are also cyclically dependent on AI capex spending, which could decelerate after initial buildouts.\n\n\n\nCredo’s non-GAAP operating expenses in the fiscal fourth quarter surged 19% sequentially to $52 million, primarily due to higher headcount. Increasing costs could become a problem if the revenue growth does not keep pace.\n\n\n\nIncreasing uncertainty prevailing over the global economy and shifting trade policy remain additional overhangs. On the last earnings call, management stated that though the guidance assumes the current tariff regime, it remains “fluid.” Any untoward change in tariff policy — especially on China-related supply chains — could directly impact margins.\n\n\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven these pros and cons, analysts have kept their earnings estimates unchanged in the past 60 days.\n\nCRDO Trades at a Premium\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, CRDO is trading at 24, higher than the Electronic-Semiconductors sector’s multiple of 8.95.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn comparison, Broadcom trades at a forward 12-month P/S multiple of 19.79, while Cirrus Logic and Marvell are trading at a multiple of 2.89 and 7.41, respectively.\n\nWhat to do With CRDO Stock?\n\nIn a market increasingly driven by AI tailwinds, CRDO stands out as a pure-play beneficiary with differentiated products, strong financials, and increasing demand. However, premium valuation, hyperscaler concentration risk, competitive pressures, and macro uncertainties limit near-term upside potential.\n\n\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), CRDO seems to be treading in the middle of the road. Investors looking to invest are better off waiting for a favorable entry point, while investors already having a position can retain the stock given the compelling long-term fundamentals.\n\n\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over 81% of S&P 500 companies have beaten estimates, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, the highest in seven quarters.\n\nCompanies have produced “an impressive beat,” while also mostly sticking with their projections for the second-half of the year, the Citi team said. As a result, consensus views on earnings per share are moving higher.\n\nThe Citi strategists raised their EPS estimates for S&P 500 members for 2025 to $272 from $261 previously, and for 2026 to $308 from $295.

The products also use AI technology to improve the user interface, making it easy to use and simple to understand. The AI reads and responds in real text, based on natural language models; in practice, Palantir’s users don’t need to learn machine language or computer coding to communicate with the AI – they can simply enter their requests in clear text and receive responses the same way. The technology is also amenable to real-time translations, making Palantir’s products easy to market internationally – the system just needs to be told what language it is using, and its translation algorithms handle the rest.\n\nThe first AI stock we’ll look at here is one of the leaders in the field. Palantir is well-known for marrying AI technology and capabilities to the field of data analysis, a match that has matured into a solid product platform – AIP, or AI Platform – and a set of tools whose wide applicability has made them highly popular. Since its founding in 2003, Palantir has developed a reputation for innovation, and has built itself into a $441 billion giant of the AI industry.\n\nWith numbers like these, it’s no surprise that UBS analysts are combing through the sector to pinpoint the most promising AI stocks. Their latest deep dive zeroes in on two recent earnings reporters – Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) – to see which is the superior AI stock to buy. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nThis equals big money for the AI developers out there. Chip makers, AI app creators, data analysis firms – all of these and more have created an industry that was valued at $233 billion last year, and is estimated by Fortune Business Insights to hit $294 billion this year – and to show a CAGR of 29.2% through 2032, reaching $1.77 trillion that year.

More and more companies are turning to the technology to enhance all sorts of functions, from customer service to chatbots to high-level data analytics and even to decision-making processes. According to Fortune Business Insights, up to 35% of all businesses have integrated AI into their work models.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company’s products and capabilities have proven particularly popular in government use, especially in the Department of Defense. This is clear from the company’s frequent announcements of new projects; DoD contracts and partnerships are regularly featured. Two examples: in July, Palantir announced that it had entered into a joint program, Warp Speed for Warships, with BlueForge Alliance, to accelerate warship production, fleet readiness, and digital transformation for the US Navy. And in June, the company launched a strategic partnership with Accenture, for the deployment of commercial-grade, AI-powered solutions designed to meet the high-priority operational challenges across a wide range of Federal agencies.\n\nIn its last quarterly report, covering 2Q25, the company announced a series of strong gains in key metrics. The company’s customer count was up 43% year-over-year, providing a base that supported a 48% YoY jump in revenue, to $1.004 billion – marking Palantir’s first billion-dollar quarter and beating the forecast by $60.5 million. At the bottom line, Palantir realized non-GAAP earnings of 16 cents per share, 2 cents per share better than had been expected. The company’s quarterly adjusted free cash flow came to $569 million, which represented a margin of 57%. And the company finished the quarter with cash and liquid assets totaling $6 billion.\n\nAbout the only thing that has grown faster than Palantir’s financial markers was the company’s share price. Year-to-date, shares in Palantir have far outpaced the broader markets. PLTR trades on the NASDAQ, which is up 11% so far this year, and it is a component of the S&P 500 index, which is up 9%; at the same time, for the year-to-date, PLTR has gained an impressive 147%. For the past three years, the stock’s gain is over 1,849%.\n\nCovering Palantir for UBS, 5-star analyst Karl Keirstead notes the company’s strong performance, yet he finds it impossible to ignore its high valuation. He writes, “Palantir reported its 8th straight quarter of revs growth acceleration, a turnaround that we’ve never seen before, from 13% growth in 2Q23 to a 2Q25 growth rate of 48%, while at a $4 billion revs scale. Palantir raised the full year 2025 total growth guidance to 45% from 36%, without compromising on the non-GAAP margin target, which was inched up to 46%. Palantir is benefiting from a confluence of mega-trends in AI application development, investments at the data layer and the modernization of defense tech, but valuation at 136x CY26E FCF remains our key hurdle…”\n\nThat hurdle leads Keirstead to rate PLTR as Neutral (i.e., Hold). His price target on the stock is $165, implying a one-year downside of ~12%. (To watch Keirstead’s track record, click here)\n\nThe Street generally would seem to agree with the UBS view. PLTR has a Hold consensus rating, based on 19 recent analyst reviews that include 4 to Buy, 13 to Hold, and 2 to Sell. The shares are priced at $186.96 and have an average price target of $152.12, suggesting that the share price will fall by ~19% in the next 12 months. (See PLTR stock forecast)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nNext up on the AI stage is AMD, a fast-rising contender steadily climbing the semiconductor ranks with a solid growth streak. It may not yet belong to the trillion-dollar club alongside Nvidia, Broadcom, and TSMC, but with a market cap near $280 billion, AMD is far from a lightweight. Over the past four quarters, it has pulled in roughly $30 billion in revenue, powered by a diverse portfolio spanning PCs, gaming rigs, and the surging AI/data-center market. Here, AMD isn’t merely keeping pace – it’s going toe-to-toe with Nvidia in AI accelerators and challenging Intel in PC microprocessors.\n\nThat competitive edge has been sharpened in recent years as AMD shifted from its roots in PCs and gaming toward a bigger slice of the AI pie. The company now offers a broad lineup of AI solutions across CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing, with the flexibility to tailor products for specific customer needs – whether in data centers, at the edge, or in enterprise applications. This diversification isn’t just theoretical; it’s showing up in high-profile wins and an expanding product pipeline.\n\nIn June, AMD landed Nokia as a customer for its 5th generation EPYC processors, which will power the Nokia Cloud Platform – a deal that underscores the broad applicability of its technology. Just a month earlier, AMD unveiled new high-performance computing products, including the Radeon RX 9060 XT and Radeon AI PRO R9700 graphics cards, plus the Ryzen Threadripper 9000 Series processors, targeting growth in gaming, content creation, and AI workloads.\n\nIn 2Q25, AMD reported gains in both AI-related and gaming sales, with AI/data center sales climbing 14% YoY to $3.2 billion and gaming revenue surging 73% to $1.1 billion. Client revenue hit a record $2.5 billion, up 67% vs. the previous year, helping overall revenue climb 32% to $7.685 billion, thereby beating the estimates by $260 million. Non-GAAP EPS came in at 48 cents, in line with expectations, while cash on hand totaled $4.44 billion. For Q3, AMD anticipates revenue of ~$8.7 billion, with a possible variation of $300 million, compared to the $8.32 billion consensus estimate.\n\nThat performance has caught the eye of UBS’s Timothy Arcuri, an analyst who ranks in 6th spot amongst the thousands of Street stock experts, who sees reasons for both caution and optimism.\n\n“AMD beat (on revenue) and guided above, but only to about where investor expectations were into the print. The bear would say that the beat was largely gaming-driven and while data center GPU is seeing a strong inflection in 2H, this was already baked into expectations and AMD did not raise the full year outlook for data center GPU despite all of the hyperscaler capex increases. In the very near-term, this may carry the day, but we think the path of travel for the business – and ultimately the stock – remains in a positive direction.”\n\nLaying out a supporting case for buying in, the 5-star analyst goes on to say, “First, excluding China, AMD’s data center GPU business is growing at a rate roughly similar to NVDA in C2H:25… Second, the outlook for market share growth in both the server and desktop portion of the CPU business is very strong with INTC’s roadmap under duress – combined, these are ~35% of AMD’s revenue and accretive to margins. Third, we would like to see gross margin inflecting quicker, but the underlying trends are still up and to the right with AMD able to at least hold GM flat even in CQ3 where the mix is unfavorable.”\n\nThat conviction earned AMD a Buy rating from Arcuri, who set a $210 price target – pointing to a potential 21.5% gain over the next year. (To watch Arcuri’s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, AMD boasts a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 37 analyst reviews that break down to 25 Buys and 12 Holds. The stock’s current trading price of $172.76 is slightly below the $180.78 average target price, implying a modest one-year upside of ~5%.

There are official distinctions, like S&P 500 components versus those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but there are also more nuanced groupings, like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, etc.\n\nSometimes, investors will get a little whimsical and come up with catchy names to describe red-hot, winning stocks. The \"Nifty Fifty\" was a popular term for large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nJim Cramer used \"FANG\" to describe Facebook (now Meta Platforms (META 3.16%)), Amazon (AMZN 0.08%), Netflix (NFLX 0.55%), and Google (now Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%)). It eventually expanded to \"FAANG\" to include Apple (AAPL 1.13%).\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the largest seven technology-focused companies: Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (TSLA 0.54%).\n\nBut the Magnificent Seven has its problems, which is why I'm introducing the \"Ten Titans\" -- the Magnificent Seven plus Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), Oracle (ORCL 0.47%), and Netflix.\n\nHere's why the Ten Titans is a better representation of top growth stocks than the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe Broadcom blunder\n\nThe biggest flaw of the Magnificent Seven is that it doesn't include Broadcom. It's up about 450% in the last three years, which has pole-vaulted its market cap well over $1 trillion.\n\nBased on market cap, it deserves to be included in the Magnificent Seven over Tesla. However, some folks may prefer the diversification that Tesla brings to the table with electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). And some may argue that it's redundant to include both Nvidia and Broadcom since they're both chip giants, but Broadcom has a much different business than Nvidia.\n\nNvidia generates the vast majority of its profits by selling graphics processing units and associated hardware and software to data centers. Like Nvidia, Broadcom makes AI chips, and AI is its fastest-growing segment, making up around 30% of total revenue in its latest quarter. But the bulk of Broadcom's business is not directly tied to AI.\n\nEnd markets include networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, infrastructure software, and more. In fact, Broadcom was considered a dividend-paying value stock before its recent boom -- similar to another high-yield semiconductor stalwart, Texas Instruments.\n\nAnother \"value\" stock turned growth stock\n\nNot long ago, Oracle was seen more as a mature tech stock with an entrenched legacy business and limited upside potential. Investors were more excited about hotter software stocks like Salesforce, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Palo Alto Networks. However, Oracle has completely transformed its business, integrating cloud infrastructure as a complement to its foothold in database software and enterprise applications.\n\nOracle has carved out a growing role in the cloud that is uniquely different from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle's hybrid and multicloud strategy integrates with the major cloud players, which allows customers to use Oracle's database advantages even if they're with another cloud provider.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers some advantages over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, including lower prices in some cases, more AI tools, and vertical integration with the company's other database services.\n\nSome drawbacks of OCI are that it has a smaller ecosystem with fewer preset tools for developers. However, Oracle is growing faster than the major players with a 27% year-over-year cloud revenue increase in its most recent quarter, including a 52% rise in cloud infrastructure revenue.\n\nLike Broadcom, Oracle is a great addition to the Ten Titans because it's a highly diversified company that's playing a growing role in AI.\n\nFAANG's anchor is a worthy addition to the Ten Titans\n\nNetflix was an integral part of FANG and FAANG, but it fell out of favor for a while as it underperformed the broad market. The streaming company is now worth around half a trillion dollars, which has catapulted it to the top 20 S&P 500 companies by market cap.\n\nNetflix has pulled back from its recent highs, but the stock has still crushed the S&P 500 year to date. A big reason for its rebound in recent years is its improved cost management and more purposeful spending.\n\nA major problem with the business in the past was the boom-and-bust nature of its earnings. The company would steadily grow subscribers, but it would overspend on content and have dry spells without major success.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix spent most of the 2010s being inconsistently profitable. But over the last five years, profits have skyrocketed and its operating margin continues to climb in lockstep with revenue.\n\nThe company has revolutionized entertainment and remains the gold standard in streaming, despite tons of new competition. A lot of that success comes down to its ability to balance the quantity and quality of content it produces.\n\nIt's time to add some all-stars to the team\n\nExpanding the Magnificent Seven to the Ten Titans corrects for the blatant error of Broadcom's omission and includes massively important growth stocks in Oracle and Netflix. Over the next three to five years, it wouldn't be surprising if all of the Titans were worth over $1 trillion due to their industry leadership and runways for growth.\n\nWith a combined weighting of 37.7% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans offer investors a useful way to track the top growth stocks that can really move the major indexes and keep tabs on prevailing themes that are driving the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:10:07.162455+00:00"}

Apple has also opened a manufacturing academy in Detroit, administered by Michigan State University, to train U.S. workers in AI and smart manufacturing.\n\nMagnifying Apple's appeasement and political diplomacy, Tim Cook presented a custom-made glass sculpture engraved with President Trump’s name and mounted on a 24-karat gold base. Most importantly to investors, the gesture was symbolic and strategic, as it coincided with Trump’s announcement that Apple would be exempt from the 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors.\n\nAAPL is Gaining Momentum\n\nAttributed to the tariff exemptions, Apple stock has now spiked +10% in August, with these month-to-date gains leading its “Magnificent Seven” big tech peers.\n\nHowever, AAPL is still toward the bottom of the group for the year, down 9% to only top Tesla’s TSLA -18%, with Nvidia NVDA up more than +30% and leading the pack.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAAPL Valuation Comparison\n\nIn terms of valuation, Apple currently checks in with the third cheapest P/E ratio among the Mag 7 at 30.5X forward earnings, only trailing Alphabet’s GOOGL 19.7X and Meta Platforms META 27.2X.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple also has the third-lowest P/S ratio among these big tech peers at 8.1X forward sales, trailing Amazon’s AMZN 3.3X and Alphabet’s 6.4X.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:10:08.983728+00:00"}

(AVGO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +10.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which Broadcom Inc. falls in, has gained 5.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Broadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.66 per share, indicating a change of +33.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +36.1%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.28 indicates a change of +24.9% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Broadcom Inc..", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:10:17.861817+00:00"}

Traders looking for a conservative option could use a bull put spread.", "url": "https://www.investors.com/research/options/broadcom-avgo-stock-bull-put-spread-options-2/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo", "published_at": "2025-08-08T12:02:06Z", "source": "Investor's Business Daily", "text": "Broadcom (AVGO) stock continues to show impressive strength as the artificial intelligence boom rolls on. Traders looking for a more conservative way to play Broadcom via options could use a bull put spread.\n\nAs a reminder, a bull put spread is a defined-risk strategy, so you always know the worst-case scenario in advance. This type of trade will profit if Broadcom stock trades sideways or higher and even sometimes if it trades slightly lower, offering flexibility in uncertain markets.\n\nThe strategy involves simultaneously selling a higher strike put option while buying a lower strike put option in the same expiration cycle.\n\nIn exchange for selling the bull put spread, the trader receives the option premium. Further, that has risk equal to the difference in strike prices, less the premium received.\n\nSetting Up The Bull Put Spread Trade\n\nTraders who think Broadcom will stay above 270 for the next few weeks could sell a Sept. 19 bull put spread running from 260 to 270 for around $1.90 a share. Note that the 50-day moving average is currently trading around 270 and could potentially provide support on a pullback.\n\nSelling this spread would generate roughly $190 in premium on a 100-share contract with a maximum risk of $810. If the spread expires worthless that would be a 23.5% return in just over one month, provided Broadcom stock is above 270 at expiration.\n\nThe maximum loss would occur if Broadcom stock closes below 260 on Sept. 19, which would see the premium seller lose $810 on the trade. Also, the break-even point for the trade is 268.10. That is calculated as 270 less the $1.90 option premium per contract.\n\nThat's 11.7% below Thursday's closing price.\n\nIt's best to set a stop loss if the stock breaks back below 270, or if the spread increases in value from $1.90 to $3.80. Sticking to this stop-loss level will help avoid large losses if the stock drops back down.\n\nMeanwhile, for investors seeking income generation with defined-risk parameters, this Broadcom bull put spread presents an appealing opportunity in the current market environment.\n\nBroadcom Stock: First In Its Group\n\nAccording to IBD Stock Checkup, Broadcom stock ranks first in its group. Further, Investor's Business Daily gives it best-possible scores of 99 for its Composite Rating and Earnings Per Share Rating. Its Relative Strength Rating currently stands at 95.\n\nAlso, Broadcom stock is featured on IBD's Big Cap 20, Leaderboard, and Tech Leaders lists.\n\nThe company is a leading global supplier of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Its products support enterprise networking, data centers, telecom, smartphones, industrial automation and more. Broadcom also offers cybersecurity solutions through its Symantec portfolio, covering endpoint, network and identity security.\n\nBroadcom unveiled its new Jericho 4 Ethernet fabric router, designed to support large-scale AI infrastructure by interconnecting more than 1 million processors across multiple data centers.\n\nThe chip enhances bandwidth, security and performance, addressing the limitations of single data-center setups for complex AI workloads. It also complements Broadcom's existing networking products like the Tomahawk 6 and Tomahawk Ultra.\n\nIt's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\n\nGavin McMaster is founder and operator of Options Trading IQ, a website offering instruction on how to buy and sell options.

Investing in value stocks at a later job broadened his skill set further. Thirteen years ago, he began managing Columbia Global Technology Growth, which he's grown from a $100 million fund to a $4 billion fund today.\n\nColumbia Global Technology Growth's winning formula? Invest in both secular growth companies and tech stocks that offer attractive value opportunities.\n\nThe fund is a 2025 IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, meaning it has topped the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2025, this top mutual fund is up 11.33% through Aug. 1, besting the S&P 500's 6.75% gain. IBD caught up with Narang to learn more about his investment philosophy and the state of tech stocks.\n\nTechnology Mutual Fund Goes For Wins\n\nIBD: What's the fund's main goal?\n\nRahul Narang: Consistently delivering strong, risk-adjusted returns over time.\n\nIBD: The fund falls dead in the middle of Morningstar's risk spectrum. Explain.\n\nNarang: Our philosophy is to build a global, diversified technology strategy, which offers a balance of secular growth opportunities and value opportunities.\n\nIBD: What do you look for in a stock?\n\nNarang: We try to own great businesses run by the best management teams regardless of market cap or geographic location. We're looking for sustainable competitive advantages, high barriers to entry, strong return on investment (ROE). We gravitate to moat-type businesses, which could come in the form of cost advantage, high switching cost, strong intellectual property, durable brand, global scale, pricing power or network effects on a durable platform. We really try to avoid businesses in secular decline.\n\nTech Fund Has Balanced Approach\n\nIBD: How did you come by this balanced approach to tech investing?\n\nNarang: In terms of portfolio construction, we've divided it into three buckets: moat-type businesses, secular growth themes and value opportunities. I spent seven years at a deep value shop. I wanted to come up with a unique technology strategy that will keep our clients in the game when there's a risk-off period.\n\nIBD: Cite examples of moat stocks the fund owns?\n\nNarang: These are names that we've owned for over a decade. That's really important. Our turnover is 7%, (which means the fund rarely sells stocks it owns). That's generated good tax-efficiency and compounding for our clients. The fund has posted compound returns of 20.5% over the past 10 years.\n\nNames include Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet (GOOGL), Broadcom (AVGO), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Booking Holdings (BKNG) and, yes, Nvidia (NVDA). We've held Nvidia for 11 years. (It's the fund's top holding with a 15.2% weighting, according to Morningstar.) It gives you a sense of the type of businesses we gravitate to and the long duration we hold these stocks.\n\nGuiding Moneymaking Factors\n\nIBD: What else is key to your investment philosophy?\n\nNarang: Identifying the correct theme and ride the curve over time. This can create tremendous shareholder value. Some of the themes we've been invested in over the years include cloud computing, cybersecurity, digital transformation, digital payments, autonomous driving, digital media and, of course, AI.\n\nIBD: Is AI a big focus of the fund?\n\nNarang: AI is now the largest theme in our strategy. We've been invested in this theme since 2016. AI names are sprinkled throughout the portfolio. And some of the emerging themes that we're doing work on currently include defense tech, quantum computing, and humanoid robots. In visual media we own (streaming service) Netflix (NFLX) and (music streaming platform) Spotify (SPOT). In cybersecurity we like CrowdStrike (CRWD). Names in digital payments would be Visa and Mastercard.\n\nKeeping Turnover Down At Tech Fund\n\nIBD: Why is your turnover so low?\n\nNarang: We tend to take a very long-term lens and realize that things usually don't go up straight to the right. There may be periods of digestion. You don't want to get shaken out of a theme based upon short-term noise.\n\nIBD: What's the final part of your investment strategy?\n\nNarang: The last bucket is value opportunities, which brings balance into the portfolio. Here's where the valuations are much cheaper and where we believe the inherent value of the business should be higher than the current stock price. Some examples include NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Samsung and Western Digital (WDC). Look at a company like Western Digital; they just reported quarterly earnings on July 30, and revenues were up 30% versus a year ago. The stock is trading around 15 times forward earnings.\n\nIBD: Why throw value stocks into a growth fund?\n\nNarang: This is part of our secret sauce. When we were constructing this approach 13 years ago, we looked at a lot of data. What we found (looking at research) is that over the last 40 years in technology investing, stocks in the most expensive and least expensive quintiles of valuation metrics tend to outperform, and names in the middle get stuck in growth purgatory.\n\nTech Fund Focused On The U.S.\n\nIBD: It's a global fund but U.S. tech stocks make up 91% of the fund. Why?\n\nNarang: What I've noticed over time is that the best business models with leading innovation are based here in the U.S.\n\nIBD: Talk about some foreign moat stocks.\n\nNarang: One of the names we own outside of the U.S. that have moat characteristics is Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). They're the largest semiconductor manufacturer tied to the AI theme. That's a top 10 position for us, and a name we've held for many years.\n\nAll the leading tech companies in the U.S., whether it's an Nvidia or an Apple (AAPL), have their chips typically manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor. They have one of the best management teams I've met. Taiwan Semiconductor won the foundry game. Taiwan Semiconductor is a classic example of a great business with a strong moat. And the valuation is also not egregious, plus they have pricing power. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it wouldn't surprise him if Taiwan Semiconductor were to raise prices because of the value that they add. They're also in the sweet spot of a big secular trend. They're right in the middle of this AI thing.\n\nOther global names include Samsung, which is more in the value camp. The stock's done well this year. It's up 30%-plus on the resurgence of orders, like the big $16.5 billion deal for Samsung to make chips for Tesla (TSLA) recently. And RELX (RELX) out of London has a really interesting AI and legal angle coming together.\n\nSafety With Moats\n\nIBD: These moat companies are the real deal, aren't they?\n\nNarang: Absolutely. When I look at AI, I divide them into pretenders versus contenders. My antenna goes off when I hear a lot of hype, and there's no real revenue. Those AI names I call pretenders. But then there's real companies that have real revenues and earnings. Obviously, Nvidia. Taiwan Semiconductor is right up there.\n\nIBD: Is the AI trade still alive?\n\nNarang: We've been invested in AI since 2016, so almost 10 years. But the inflection point, and this is really important, started to happen in late 2022 when companies finally had the computing power and data to harness more performance from these deep neural networks. And then OpenAI released ChatGPT in late November of 2022 for public use, which is (like) the iPhone moment for AI.\n\nMind The Downsides As A Tech Fund\n\nIBD: What are some risks?\n\nNarang: One needs to pay attention to the timeline of investments that companies are making around AI, as it may take time to see the ROI on these investments, or productivity improvements they were hoping for. We have seen a few 20% or so drawdowns in the AI complex over the last few years as they have proved to be excellent long-term buying opportunities. Other risks include government restrictions on chip sales to China, tariffs and geopolitics.\n\nIBD: What makes Nvidia, your top holding, a good core holding?\n\nNarang: We've held it for 11 years. If you want one AI name, Nvidia is it. They are very representative of what we call the picks and shovels of AI. Semiconductors provide the computing power for these cloud companies to harness the data that they have. That's key.\n\nPlug Into AI\n\nIBD: What other stocks are positioned to keep profiting from AI?\n\nNarang: We still feel like we're very early in AI. We saw stellar earnings results (last week) from Meta (META) and Microsoft. Meta is seeing strong performance in advertising, largely thanks to AI unlocking greater efficiency and gains across their app system. AI is improving engagement for their users. It's also improving Meta's ability to show people more relevant targeted content.\n\nMicrosoft, obviously, with their Azure cloud business. That business grew 39% in their latest fiscal quarter, and is now a $75 billion business. What's driving that? It's continued adoption in the cloud, and some AI workloads are moving into the cloud. You've got Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia. Another name that's benefiting from the AI theme is Broadcom, a name we've held for over a decade and our third-biggest holding. They do custom AI chips. One of their customers is Alphabet (GOOGL). It's been a monster of a compounder for us. They are part of the AI picks and shovels stocks. They're a huge semiconductor supplier with a great balance sheet, strong free cash flow generator. Hock Tan, the CEO, is probably one of the best CEOs in semiconductors, right up there with Nvidia's Huang.\n\nTech Fund Mines Big Earnings Gains\n\nIBD: What message does the blowout earnings from Meta and Microsoft send?\n\nNarang: We're seeing growth at scale and the moat widening for these megacap companies. That's the message.\n\nIBD: You're not worried about all the spending on AI?\n\nNarang: Let me just give you some estimates I saw this morning of the AI capital spending from the Big Five: Alphabet, Oracle (ORCL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta and Microsoft. These are just rough numbers, $350 billion plus in 2025 going to $450 billion plus in 2026. The point is these businesses have required a tremendous amount of capital, but then you're seeing Meta say, \"Oh, our revenue growth accelerated 22% from 16% in the first quarter.\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says there's a very high chance the world is going to look pretty different a few years from now. So, this helps explain why we're seeing these strong capex numbers from the hyperscalers. The competitive landscape is changing so quickly, and they don't want to be left out.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, we're seeing growth and scale and moats widening. It's really remarkable.\n\nIs $4 Trillion The Limit?\n\nIBD: What do you say to investors who say, \"Nvidia and Microsoft are $4 trillion companies. How high can they go?\"\n\nNarang: It's funny, I got asked that question the day they hit $1 trillion, $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion. It's a fair question. We try to step back and look at the total addressable market: is it expanding? Are the companies seeing a return on their investment (ROI)?\n\nIBD: It's about sales and earnings, right?\n\nNarang: I remember 1999 when tech stocks were trading at 100, 200, 300 times earnings. They were trading on price to eyeballs. But this go around, these companies are generating real cash flows, real earnings, real scale, and they're not trading at crazy valuations. As long as the earnings come through, growth will continue to accelerate.\n\nIBD: To make money, do investors have to invest in these big trends like AI?\n\nNarang: One of the mistakes people make is that they identify a big trend correctly. But then when there's a little bit of noise, they get scared out (of the market). And then they miss that long-term (compounding) over time.\n\nTech Fund Taps Into The Legal Market\n\nIBD: Why are you bullish on RELX?\n\nNarang: We bought RELX a year or two ago. So, it's a newer name. They own an asset called LexisNexis, a legal database that law firms use. They are starting to bring AI capabilities into some of their legal products. It's a steady grower with good valuation support. We just saw this as an interesting asset tied to legal AI, and they have a real moat around their business, because their product, LexisNexis, is highly regarded in the legal field.\n\nIBD: What non-megacap companies are in the fund?\n\nNarang: Robinhood (HOOD), the financial services platform that's now valued at nearly $90 billion. They reported second-quarter earnings July 30 (and revenue jumped 45%, driven by crypto.) The stock was up 125%. It's a name we added this year.\n\nIBD: What do you like about Robinhood?\n\nNarang: Growth is accelerating. We really like their focus on the younger demographic. The pace of innovation at the company has been spectacular. Their strong position in crypto trading, along with product innovation, were two of the main reasons we started a position. (Another plus) is we just saw a sea change in the regulatory environment with the new Trump administration.\n\nAre We In A Tech Bubble?\n\nIBD: There's been talk of a bubble. Is the stock market frothy?\n\nNarang: In the bubble years of 1999-2000, Cisco was trading at 100 plus times earnings. Now Cisco trades at 16, 17 times earnings. Meta is trading around 27 times. The valuations are nowhere close to the 1999 bubble valuations. The other big difference is now the free cash flow characteristics of these tech companies are so much stronger than in prior years. Through the first quarter, tech free cash flow margins were 22%. That's three times the rest of the market. That points to the quality of the business.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:10:23.711777+00:00"}

While a few of the technology companies have been building critical infrastructure needed to power the digital economy, many others have successfully developed consumer applications that have become indispensable for billions of users.\n\nHere are three technology giants that have generated exceptional long-term returns for shareholders and are well worth considering today.\n\nBroadcom\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure giant Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%) has created an exceptional portfolio of customized semiconductor chips and infrastructure software solutions.\n\nBroadcom’s financials are impressive. The company raked in $15 billion of revenue in the second quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended May 4), up 20% year over year. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) reached $10 billion, translating into a 67% margin.\n\nThe chipmaker produced $6.4 billion in free cash flow during the second quarter and has a strong balance sheet with $9.5 billion in cash. Thanks to its strong cash generation and solid financial position, it has returned an impressive $7 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and stock buybacks.\n\nBroadcom’s AI semiconductor business (custom accelerators and AI networking) remains the key growth engine, with revenue rising 46% year over year to $4.4 billion in the second quarter. While custom accelerator revenue was up double-digits, AI networking revenue soared by more than 170% in the second quarter. Management now expects the company’s AI semiconductor revenue to grow 60% to $5.1 billion in the third quarter.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, which dominates the GPU landscape, Broadcom has become a major provider of custom processors and is currently working with three hyperscalers who are each planning to deploy 1 million AI accelerator clusters by 2027.\n\nBesides chips, the company’s advances in AI networking (Tomahawk 6 switches) are enabling massive AI clusters in a manner that can lower latency and improve bandwidth, all while reducing power consumption. Broadcom's $61 billion acquisition of VMware, an infrastructure software company, is also proving to be a brilliant move. Broadcom’s infrastructure software business now operates at a 93% gross margin and 76% operating margin.\n\nConsidering Broadcom’s cutting-edge AI offerings and robust financials, the stock seems an impressive pick now.\n\nServiceNow\n\nServiceNow (NOW -0.38%) generates substantial revenue by selling enterprise AI and workflow automation solutions through its Now Platform. In the second quarter, the company generated over $3.1 billion in subscription revenue, up 22.5% on a year-over-year basis. With another $102 million earned from professional services and other areas, the company generated more than $3.2 billion in revenue in the second quarter, up 22.5%. Management expects to hit a $15 billion-plus subscription revenue target in 2026.\n\nThis tech giant has emerged as a significant beneficiary of the increasing adoption of enterprise AI globally. The company's Now Assist offering (a suite of generative AI capabilities integrated into the Now workflow automation platform) is projected to generate $1 billion in annual contracted business by 2026, almost four times higher than $250 million annual contracted value in early 2025.\n\nServiceNow served 528 customers paying above $5 million in annual contracted value, while the number of customers contributing beyond $20 million annually expanded by more than 30% year over year in the second quarter. The company’s Now platform boasts a remarkable 98% renewal rate, highlighting the stickiness of its offerings.\n\nThe enterprise software leader generated $535 million in free cash flows, translating into a 16.5% free-cash-flow margin in the second quarter. The company is committed to returning capital to shareholders, as is evident from $361 million worth of share repurchases in the second quarter. Despite these buybacks, ServiceNow boasts an impressive $10.8 billion in cash and investments at the end of the second quarter.\n\nConsidering the ServiceNow's many strengths, smart investors should consider at least a small stake in the company.\n\nOracle\n\nOracle (ORCL 0.47%) generates substantial cash flows by developing and selling cloud infrastructure and database software solutions, many of which are powering complex AI workloads.\n\nOracle's database technology works in conjunction with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI, Oracle's cloud computing platform). It is also compatible with all of the leading cloud platforms, such as Amazon’s AWS, Alphabet’s Google Cloud, and Microsoft’s Azure. Additionally, Oracle Database 23ai enables enterprises to work with their proprietary data and all the popular large language models while maintaining complete security.\n\nThe company reported $15.9 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended May 31), up 11% year over year. OCI was a significant growth driver, and saw revenue jump 52% to $3 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe enterprise technology leader generated $20.8 billion in operating cash flow during fiscal 2025, an increase of 12% year over year. With its backlog growing 41% year over year to $138 billion at the end of fiscal 2025 and further expected to grow 100% by the end of fiscal 2026, Oracle enjoys exceptional revenue visibility.\n\nOracle is also committed to returning capital to shareholders, as is evident from $150 million in share buybacks in the fourth quarter and dividend payments of almost $4.7 billion in fiscal 2025.

This six-week period, where many of Wall Street's most influential businesses lift the hood on their operating results, provides investors with invaluable information.\n\nHowever, an equally strong argument can be made that the quarterly filing of Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission is just as important as earnings season. A 13F offers investors a way to see which stocks Wall Street's top money managers have been buying and selling. In other words, these filings clue investors in to the stocks, industries, sectors, and trends that have piqued the interest of highly successful asset managers.\n\nArguably no trend has been hotter than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Empowering software and systems with the tools to make split-second decisions without human intervention is a multitrillion-dollar global opportunity, which explains why AI stocks have soared.\n\nBut not all of Wall Street's prominent billionaire fund managers are along for the ride.\n\nBased on 13Fs filed in mid-May that detail first-quarter trading activity, Appaloosa's billionaire chief David Tepper has been a big-time seller of three red-hot AI stocks -- Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), or TSMC -- over the previous year. Curiously, though, Tepper has been loading up on another AI stock that somewhat recently joined the exclusive trillion-dollar club.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper has been a persistent seller of Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC stock\n\nTepper and his team tend to be fairly active and are regularly building up or reducing their existing stakes. Rather than looking at changes from the prior three-month period, more wisdom can often be gained by examining year-over-year changes to Appaloosa's more than $8 billion dollar investment portfolio.\n\nBetween April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025, Tepper oversaw a significant reduction in, or the complete exit from, three of the AI revolution's top companies:\n\nNvidia : 4,120,000 shares sold (93% reduction), which has been adjusted to account for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024.\n\n: 4,120,000 shares sold (93% reduction), which has been adjusted to account for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor : 230,000 shares sold (46% reduction).\n\n: 230,000 shares sold (46% reduction). Advanced Micro Devices: 1,630,000 shares sold (completely exited position).\n\nAll three of these companies have been successful in their own right within the AI arena. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the bulk of GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers, while AMD's Instinct series chips are slowly adding market share. Meanwhile, TSMC is the world's leading chip-fabrication company, with its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity rapidly expanding to satiate growing enterprise demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nIf everything is going to well for Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC, the question that has to be asked is: Why did billionaire David Tepper sell over a 12-month period?\n\nSimple profit-taking is one of the more logical answers. All three companies have seen their shares appreciate noticeably over the trailing-three-year period, and Tepper has demonstrated he's not shy about locking in gains. What's worrisome is there may be more to this persistent selling activity than just a desire to take some chips off the table.\n\nFor example, every next-big-thing technology since (and including) the proliferation of the internet in the mid-1990s has navigated its way through a bubble that eventually burst. In plainer English, investors continually overestimate the adoption rates and/or utility of game-changing technological advances. It's going to take time for AI to mature as a technology and for businesses to figure out how to optimize their solutions and generate a positive return on their investments. This suggests another bubble may be brewing.\n\nWhereas Taiwan Semiconductor is a diversified company that generates a meaningful percentage of its net sales from fabricating chips for smartphones, Internet of Things, and automotive, Nvidia and AMD are increasingly reliant on enterprise GPU orders. If an AI bubble were to form and burst, these two companies would be hit hard.\n\nValuation may have also come into play for Appaloosa's billionaire chief. Historically, industry-leading businesses thriving on the heels of a next-big-thing trend have topped out at 30 to 40 times trailing-12-month sales. Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 31, as of this writing.\n\nWith the stock market also historically pricey, Tepper may view Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC as being on shakier ground than their respective share prices would indicate.\n\nThis trillion-dollar AI stock is bucking the trend in Tepper's fund\n\nWhereas billionaire David Tepper has been an undeniable seller of artificial intelligence stocks over the trailing year, based on 13F filings, there's one trillion-dollar AI stock that's managed to buck the trend. During the March-ended quarter, Appaloosa gobbled up 130,000 shares of Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), which is one of only 11 public companies around the world to have ever reached a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nWhile Nvidia and AMD have locked down the lion's share of GPU market share in AI-accelerated data centers, Broadcom is the preferred choice for its host of AI networking solutions. Its products are capable of connecting tens of thousands of AI-GPUs in order to maximize compute capacity, as well as minimize tail latency. Put simply, Broadcom's hardware reduces lag, which facilitates the split-second decisions that need to be made by AI-empowered software and systems.\n\nBroadcom is also making a name for itself thanks to its custom AI chips. During the company's fourth-quarter conference call in late 2024, CEO Hock Tan opined that a few of its hyperscaler clients could spend anywhere from $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 (its fiscal year ends in late October or early November). As long as AI remains a hot trend, Broadcom is expected to be one of the more unstoppable stocks.\n\nBut what Appaloosa's Tepper might appreciate most about Broadcom is that it's much more than just an AI-driven company. While AI is, unquestionably, Broadcom's most meaningful growth driver at the moment, it has plenty of other channels that generate sales and positive operating cash flow.\n\nBefore AI became the hottest thing on Wall Street, Broadcom was known for its lead role in developing wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Even though smartphones aren't the growth story they were a decade ago, the ongoing expansion of 5G service globally provides a modest growth opportunity for Broadcom.\n\nIn addition, it offers an assortment of solutions for industrial product lines and automobiles, as well as owns an enterprise cybersecurity solutions division. The point being that if the AI bubble were to burst, Broadcom would, in all likelihood, be in better shape to navigate the coming storm than hardware giants Nvidia and AMD.\n\nLastly, Tepper may have found Broadcom's valuation more palatable than the likes of Nvidia. As of this writing on Aug. 5, Broadcom is valued at 35 times forward-year earnings, but appears to be sporting a sustainable annual growth rate of 20% or greater.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:10:46.209491+00:00"}

Cody, it is good to see you. So AMD reports, what do you make of the results, Cody?\n\n00:13 Cody Acree\n\nYeah, they look like strong numbers to me up about 300 million this quarter and about a similar amount for September. Uh the bottom line is a little iffy, uh, given that they're just in line with the consensus, 48 cents for June. And then, uh, the bottom line for next quarter, uh, they don't give\n\n00:48 Cody Acree\n\nuh, an EPS guidance, uh, but they are saying that it excludes any China shipments, which we expect them to get back into China quickly, uh, as the Trump administration has relaxed those guidelines. And so, um, that number 800 million came out of the June number. And so if you add that back in, then you've got, uh, a really nice upside this quarter. And if you add anything back into September, then that 400 million turns into probably something closer to a billion dollars of upside. And so I think overall it's a very strong number and hence the stock reaction after hours.\n\n01:39 Speaker A\n\nCody, let me ask you a a key issue that obviously, you know, your colleagues on the street are asking broadly, Cody, how big is the AI opportunity for AMD, for Lisa Su's company with China sanctions reversed?\n\n02:06 Cody Acree\n\nWell, with China sanctions, it's about a billion and a half, uh, that they expect that they lost this last two quarters. And so, uh, I think that reverses pretty quickly. Uh overall for AI, uh, it's a huge opportunity because you see what Nvidia is doing, and really AMD is the only viable alternative outside of the custom ASICs that the hyper scalars are doing. So if you want general purpose CPUs and every server has to run on a general purpose CPU, uh, to handle all the back office and all the coordination of these hyper scalar data centers, um, then if you're looking for an alternative to Intel or Nvidia, AMD is really the only game in town and they've been really eating Intel's lunch from a performance standpoint and from a price and performance standpoint versus Nvidia. They're also very, very good alternative. So I think the upside is really unlimited for AMD. It's just a matter of, uh, can they capture it? And I think so far they are starting to.\n\n03:50 Speaker A\n\nCody, you mentioned Nvidia. When you think about AMD's latest and greatest AI chips,\n\n04:00 Speaker A\n\nhow would you stack them up versus Nvidia? Is there a performance gap there?\n\n04:07 Cody Acree\n\nWell, with their MI 350, uh, they're they've really closed the gap. Uh, with their 400, they're getting some performance advantage. Really where AMD gets the biggest advantages in their their memory bandwidth, uh, their ability to throughput faster data. Uh, and so on a processing to processing basis, AMD likely still trails in video somewhat, but they make what they make up for or lack in processing, they make up for in memory bandwidth. And that's really their strength and that's that's really the, uh, the the, uh, the gating factor for these hyper scale data centers is how fast can they push product through these processors. Uh, it's not necessarily absolute processing speed, but it's the bandwidth of memory, uh, that is the limiting factor.\n\n05:13 Speaker A\n\nChris, I want to get you in here because Cody, and Cody likes this name. I know he tells his clients this one's a buy. You're not such a fan, Chris, of this this one. Explain why.\n\n05:31 Chris\n\nWell, it isn't that we're not a fan, right? You know, when you look at the pro portfolio, we we have shares in Nvidia and we have shares of Marvel and you know, uh, I I think Cody said, if I remember correctly, that AMD is a viable alternative after some of the custom ASIC chips that the hyperscalars are doing. You're talking about, you know, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet. That is one of the angles that Marvel offers us opportunity into those custom ASICs as well as writing the overall wave of AI and data center demand. Marvel also has the, uh, you know, enterprise networking and the carrier infrastructure, which I see really benefiting from incremental capital spending as AI adoption continues to rise.\n\n06:35 Speaker A\n\nCody, your your response to Chris's comments there.\n\n06:40 Cody Acree\n\nI completely agree with Chris on that. Uh, the ASIC vendors, uh, the Marvels and Broadcoms of the world are really coming on into their own as the hyperscalars are continuing to lean into custom solutions. Uh, they're wanting tailored specific solutions for their very tailored specific workloads. And so, uh, they don't need to pay for all the overhead of a general GPU that is Nvidia, uh, if they've got a very specific workload that they need to customize for. And, uh, with these ASIC vendors, they're able to do exactly that and provide a much cheaper internal solution that is that meets only the needs of the hyperscalars individually. And, um, and I think that that's a big market going forward. But, uh, there's also the need for general purpose GPUs CPUs. Uh, and so, uh, I think that AMD can bridge in between, uh, because you do need CPUs to run even those hyperscale servers that are running Marvel and Broadcom chips. They have to have CPUs to manage all that backlog or that back office workload. And so, um, I think that AMD is a very, very nice alternative to Intel today, is what we've seen. And, uh, and and to Nvidia's Grace Hopper or Grace CPU that, uh, that is is entrenched in their Blackwell processor.\n\n09:12 Speaker A\n\nCody, how should investors think about the 232 tariffs and what that could mean for AMD's financials?\n\n09:26 Cody Acree\n\nWell, the the tariffs are are less of an issue, I think, uh, only because, uh, these processors are are being built largely, uh, in in Arizona. And and so these are domestic, uh, production into domestic data centers. And so I don't think tariffs are going to be a major issue. Uh, there are issues as, uh, AMD starts to ship into China, uh, and any restrictions into China, but I don't think that that tariffs are going to be a major concern.\n\n10:16 Speaker A\n\nYou know, Cody, AMD offered what looked like a solid forecast here. You see the shares are slipping here at least, you know, in the after hours. What do you chalk that up to, Cody, potentially? Was this just a very high bar heading into this print?\n\n10:35 Cody Acree\n\nYeah, I think so. I think that AMD has had such a run that almost anything was going to cause some profit taking. Um, only an absolute blowout number, uh, was going to probably keep investors happy. And so I think that anything close to the the bottom line in-line June number and what probably will shake out to be close to, uh, the bottom line September number, uh, is going to be an excuse for traders to take profits. And and I don't blame them for that. Uh, but I do think in the long run, AMD is a great investment, uh, and it will grind higher, um, following any any quick trading volatility.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:11:02.342598+00:00"}

This is a great sign ahead of AMD’s Q2 report, as the company’s Central Processing Units (CPUs) and GPUs led to a 57% surge in its data center revenue in Q1.\n\nAlso fueling investor sentiment is that recent U.S. policy shifts have loosened export restrictions, allowing AMD to resume its chip shipments to China and potentially adding hundreds of millions in revenue. Rebounding and surging over +70% in the last three months, AMD stock is now up +45% year to date to impressively top the S&P 500 and Nasdaq’s returns of +6% and +8% respectively, while even topping Nvidia’s +32%.\n\nAMD’s Q2 Expectations\n\nWith analysts expecting another strong quarter of data center growth, AMD’s Q2 sales are expected to be up 27% to $7.41 billion compared to $5.84 billion a year ago. However, AMD is also facing the impact of competitive pricing in the CPU and GPU market, with Q2 earnings thought to have dipped to $0.47 a share compared to EPS of $0.69 in the prior period.\n\nAttributing to margin pressures, higher R&D spending on its next-generation GPUs is thought to have weighed on AMD’s bottom line during Q2 as well.\n\nThat said, AMD has reached or exceeded the Zacks EPS Consensus for 25 consecutive quarters, dating back to April of 2019, and has posted an average EPS surprise of 2.3% over its last four quarterly reports. Plus, AMD is still projected to post double-digit top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2025 and FY26, but Wall Street is very much anticipating the company's Q3 guidance to see if the chipmaker can sustain its growth trajectory.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:11:19.807902+00:00"}

Ambiq might have the solution.\n\nSince generative artificial intelligence (AI) burst on the scene more than two years ago, some of the biggest beneficiaries have been chipmakers. More specifically, advanced semiconductors provide the computational horsepower necessary to breathe life into these AI algorithms.\n\nNvidia, Broadcom, and Arm Holdings have all been at the forefront of AI chip design and reaped the rewards. Nvidia and Broadcom stocks have soared 961% and 439%, respectively, since late 2022, while Arm has gained 173% since its September 2023 initial public offering (IPO).\n\nAmbiq Micro (AMBQ 13.49%) made a big splash during its public debut, as the low-power chip designer's stock surged 61% on its first day of trading last Wednesday, though it has since leveled off. Investors have been keen to profit from the ongoing adoption of AI, and the robust demand for Ambiq Micro stock suggests that power-miserly AI chip stocks could mark the next frontier.\n\nThe power conundrum\n\nOne of the biggest challenges associated with the increasing adoption of AI is the issue of power consumption. Most chipmakers have taken a brute-force approach, increasing the sheer magnitude of computational horsepower to decrease the time necessary to train and run these next-generation algorithms. The complex calculations required are computationally intensive, resulting in an increasing amount of energy consumption.\n\nAmbiq is taking a different approach. In the S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prior to its IPO, the company described itself as a \"pioneer and leading provider of ultra-low-power semiconductor solutions designed to address the significant power consumption challenges of general-purpose and AI compute -- especially at the edge.\" Ambiq suggests its hardware and software innovations \"deliver two to five times lower power consumption than traditional semiconductor design.\"\n\nThe company is currently focused on the edge, including personal devices, as well as the medical and healthcare industries. Many of these applications are currently handled by small devices with limited battery life, where reduced power consumption is critical.\n\nIn the future, Ambiq is working to expand its ultra-low-power technology to other areas of AI, including high-performance computing (HPC), data centers, and automotive, which could mark the next wave of AI chip solutions.\n\nA growing opportunity\n\nThe need for power-miserly solutions could usher in the next wave of AI chips, and Ambiq's results are intriguing. For the year ended Dec. 31, the company generated revenue of $76 million, up 16% year over year, while its loss per share of $113.81 improved 24%. The trend continued in the quarter ended March 31, as revenue of $15.7 million climbed 3%, while its loss per share of $18.96 improved 30%.\n\nThere is a significant concentration risk. Ambiq divulged that its top five customers accounted for 92% of revenue in the most recent quarter. Furthermore, wireless device specialist Garmin, Alphabet's Google, and \"another confidential customer\" represented 38%, 25%, and 23% of net sales, respectively, according to its regulatory filing.\n\nAmbiq's flagship system-on-a-chip (SoC) is designed for smaller form-factor devices, such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, hearing aids, virtual and augmented reality glasses, and livestock tracking devices.\n\nChief technology officer (CTO) Scott Hanson noted the company's next frontier is smart glasses. \"We spent the last 10-plus years figuring out how to build the lowest power chips, and so we're in a great position to attack the same problem (on glasses),\" he said.\n\nThe low-power wearable chips market is expected to grow by 15% annually between 2024 and 2030 to nearly $28 billion. When viewed in the context of Ambiq's 2024 sales of $76 million, the opportunity is apparent.\n\nEvery rose has its thorns\n\nIt's important to remember that while Ambiq's potential is clear, risks abound. It has only just entered the glare of the public spotlight, and investors should keep in mind the aforementioned concentration risk and mounting losses, though its results are moving in the right direction.\n\nThere's also the matter of Ambiq's valuation. As of market close on Monday, the stock had a market cap of roughly $673 million and trailing-12-month sales of $76.6 million. That works out to about 9 times sales, and while that's certainly not outrageous, it is a high price to pay for an unprofitable company with little public track record.\n\nAs such, investors interested in taking a stake in this ultra-low-power pioneer should make Ambiq a small part of a well-balanced portfolio.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:11:21.431737+00:00"}

The artificial intelligence’s analysis reveals just how dramatically different asset classes can perform (and why timing really is everything when it comes to investing).\n\nThe $15,000 Investment Scenario: Mid-2010\n\nTo make this comparison fair, ChatGPT set the investment date at mid-2010, when both bitcoin and several now-famous stocks were available. This timing is important because it represents a moment when ordinary investors could realistically have made any of these choices.\n\nThe AI selected five investments that seemed promising in 2010:\n\nBitcoin, trading at around $0.10 per coin\n\nNvidia stock at about $2.50 (split-adjusted)\n\nTesla, which had just gone public at $1.17 (split-adjusted)\n\nBroadcom at approximately $7.30 (adjusted for splits and mergers)\n\nNetflix at around $8.80 (adjusted for splits)\n\nEach represents $15,000 invested at that moment in time. Here’s what ChatGPT discovered about where that money would be today.\n\nFind Out: Get Paid To Watch Videos: 11 Easy Ways\n\nBitcoin: The $17.7 Billion Winner\n\nAccording to ChatGPT’s calculations, bitcoin’s results are nearly unbelievable. At $0.10 per bitcoin in mid-2010, your $15,000 would have purchased 150,000 coins.\n\nWith bitcoin trading at approximately $117,700 today, those 150,000 coins would be worth $17.655 billion.\n\n“Yes, this investment would have made you a multibillionaire,” ChatGPT confirmed, adding that bitcoin is the only asset in this comparison that achieved billionaire status.\n\nThis represents a return of over 1,000,000% — turning every dollar invested into more than $1 million.\n\nNvidia: The Stock Market’s Best Performer Still Falls Short\n\nNvidia has been the poster child for stock market success in recent years, especially with the AI boom. ChatGPT’s analysis shows it was indeed the best-performing stock in our comparison.\n\nYour $15,000 would have bought 6,000 shares at $2.50 each in 2010. With Nvidia currently trading around $175.50, those shares would be worth $1.053 million today.\n\n“Even accounting for stock splits and exact timing, Nvidia grows to around $5-6.7 million at best,” ChatGPT wrote, acknowledging that different timing within 2010 could have yielded slightly better results.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:11:44.652480+00:00"}

For example, this year, AI luminaries Nvidia and Broadcom saw shares soar more than 30% and 26%, respectively, through July 28.\n\nBut one lackluster AI stock has been C3.ai (AI 2.67%). Its shares are down about 25% this year through July 28. Could the price drop signal an opportunity to scoop up shares at a discount? After all, the global AI market is forecast to expand from $244 billion in 2025 to $1 trillion by 2031, providing a tailwind for C3.ai's business.\n\nThe reality is that evaluating whether to purchase its stock requires digging into the company. Let's delve into C3.ai to help assess if it's a sound investment for the long run.\n\nA look at C3.ai's business\n\nC3.ai is an enterprise AI applications business servicing the needs of corporate and government organizations. Its customers include the U.S. Department of Defense, Dow Inc., and ExxonMobil.\n\nThe company built a network of partnerships to assist in selling its solutions, which includes Microsoft and energy giant Baker Hughes. These alliances resulted in partners closing 73% of the customer agreements signed in C3.ai's 2025 fiscal year, ended April 30.\n\nC3.ai's business model translated into record revenue of $108.7 million, a 26% year-over-year increase, in its fiscal fourth quarter. For the full year, sales grew 25% year over year to $389.1 million.\n\nThe company's offerings have proven popular with customers. In May, the U.S. Air Force expanded its contract with C3.ai from $100 million to $450 million to supply predictive analytics that proactively identify aircraft maintenance needs.\n\nIn June, Univation Technologies, a Dow subsidiary, adopted C3.ai's predictive maintenance capabilities to deliver to its petrochemical industry customers.\n\nC3.ai's pros and cons\n\nThe company's customer wins this year suggest more revenue expansion to come. In fact, C3.ai forecasts fiscal 2026 sales to reach between $447.5 million and $484.5 million, another solid year of growth over fiscal 2025's $389.1 million.\n\nDespite rising sales, C3.ai's business isn't profitable. It ended fiscal 2025 with an operating loss of $324.4 million, deepening from a $318.3 million loss in the prior year. Costs increased from adding employees to support its business growth.\n\nOn top of that, a health issue struck CEO Tom Siebel this year, and the company is now searching for a successor. This is unfortunate news, and it contributed to the decline in C3.ai's share price. The stock price drop is understandable, since a leadership change risks disrupting the company's future success.\n\nHowever, C3.ai is striving to cut costs and strengthen its finances. Management expects to be free-cash-flow (FCF) positive by next year. It ended fiscal 2025 with negative FCF of $44.4 million, which is an improvement over the previous year's $90.4 million in negative FCF.\n\nIts balance sheet shows C3.ai is well capitalized with total assets of $1 billion, $742.7 million of which represent cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Total liabilities were $187.6 million.\n\nDeciding whether to buy C3.ai stock\n\nAlthough C3.ai isn't profitable, its strategy to prioritize business expansion over immediate profit follows a typical approach adopted by many companies in the technology sector. As long as year-over-year revenue growth remains strong and it continues to improve its financials, such as reaching positive FCF, C3.ai's operating loss isn't a major concern.\n\nThe impending departure of its CEO is regrettable, but Siebel intends to continue shepherding the company as executive chairman. This positions C3.ai for a smooth leadership transition.\n\nWith plenty of positives in its favor, does this mean now is the time to buy C3.ai's shares? To answer that, here's a look at its stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio with a comparison to Microsoft's, given Microsoft sells C3.ai's offerings, and is a prominent AI business in its own right.\n\nThe chart reveals C3.ai's valuation has significantly improved, as evidenced by the substantial drop in its P/S multiple from its late 2024 peak. This multiple is now considerably lower than Microsoft's, further highlighting C3.ai's attractive valuation.\n\nThis, combined with growing sales, a robust balance sheet, and strengthening free cash flow, makes C3.ai stock a compelling investment opportunity.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:11:46.186854+00:00"}

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is Broadcom's Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, Broadcom had US$67.3b of debt at May 2025, down from US$73.9b a year prior. However, it also had US$9.47b in cash, and so its net debt is US$57.8b.\n\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Debt to Equity History August 2nd 2025\n\nHow Healthy Is Broadcom's Balance Sheet?\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Broadcom had liabilities of US$20.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$74.4b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$9.47b as well as receivables valued at US$8.80b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$76.8b.\n\nSince publicly traded Broadcom shares are worth a very impressive total of US$1.38t, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:11:48.196559+00:00"}

This has stoked recession fears, which would directly impact demand for chips used in countless products. Compounding these worries, the White House announced new tariffs, including a 20% levy on imports from Taiwan, a global hub for chip manufacturing. This dual shock of slowing domestic growth and renewed trade friction creates a challenging outlook for the highly cyclical and globally connected semiconductor industry, leading to a broad-based sell-off.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\nZooming In On Marvell Technology (MRVL)\n\nMarvell Technology’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 39 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 3.3% on the news that it announced a collaboration with South Korean AI semiconductor company Rebellions to develop custom AI infrastructure.

I expect two artificial intelligence stocks to surpass that figure within five years. I am not talking about Nvidia, which is already worth $4.3 trillion, but rather Meta Platforms (META 3.16%) and Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%).\n\nHere's what my prediction would mean for shareholders:\n\nMeta Platforms is currently worth $1.7 trillion. The stock must gain 88% for the company to achieve a market value of $3.2 trillion, which implies annual returns of 13.5% over the next five years.\n\nBroadcom is currently worth $1.4 trillion. The stock must advance 129% for the company to achieve a market value of $3.2 trillion, which implies annual returns of 18% over the next five years.\n\nHere's why I have confidence in my predictions.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms owns three of the four most popular social media platforms in Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp as measured by monthly active users. That ability to engage people and collect data makes the company a valuable advertising partner, so much so that Meta is the second largest ad tech company in the world behind Alphabet's Google.\n\nMeta is successfully using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve consumer engagement with better content recommendations across its social media properties. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on the first-quarter earnings call time spent on Facebook increased 7% and time spent on Instagram increased 6% in the past six months.\n\nMeta is also using artificial intelligence to help marketers optimize campaign performance. The number of advertisers using AI creative tools rose 30% in the first quarter, and better ad targeting for Reels increased conversion rates by 5%. Also, Meta recently introduced new AI features that let marketers turn images into videos, embed conversational agents into ads, and translate campaigns into multiple languages.\n\nImportantly, Meta has opportunities beyond artificial intelligence. The company dominates the nascent smart glasses market, which tripled in size last year and is forecast to increase faster than 60% annually through 2029, according to Counterpoint Research. Zuckerberg has frequently asserted smart glasses with built-in holographic displays will eventually replace smartphones.\n\nHere's why Meta could surpass Apple's current market value by 2030: Wall Street estimates the company's earnings will grow at 15% annually in the next three to five years. That makes the current valuation of 27 times earnings look reasonable. And if Meta's earnings do grow at 15% annually through 2030, its market value could increase 88% to $3.2 trillion while its valuation multiple drops to 25.5 times earnings. That seems entirely plausible.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom develops infrastructure software and semiconductor solutions. The company is the market leader in Wi-Fi chipsets, which let devices like smartphones connect to wireless networks. It also dominates the market for Ethernet switch chips, which move information between data center servers and storage. Demand for high-speed networking chips will increase as artificial intelligence workloads become more common.\n\nAdditionally, Broadcom is the leading supplier of custom AI accelerators, commonly called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The company currently develops AI ASICs for seven hyperscale clients, including Apple, ByteDance, Google, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI. Broadcom also has two other unnamed customers. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate the market for AI ASICs will increase at 34% annually through 2030.\n\nHere's why Broadcom could top Apple's current market value by 2030. Wall Street expects adjusted earnings to grow at 20% annually through 2028. That makes the current valuation of 52 times adjusted earnings look tolerable. But if Broadcom's earnings increase at 20% annually through 2030, its market value could jump 129% to $3.2 trillion while its valuation drops to a more reasonable 47 times earnings.\n\nAdmittedly, it will be more difficult for Broadcom (compared to Meta Platforms) to surpass Apple's current market value within five years. But I still think it's a distinct possibility. Not only because the company beat the consensus earnings estimate by 4% during the past six quarters -- which suggests Wall Street analysts may be underestimating future earnings growth -- but also because management says AI chip revenue could more than quadruple by 2027.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:12:08.350421+00:00"}

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), as well as two micro-cap stocks Oil-Dri Corp. of America (ODC) and Park Aerospace Corp. (PKE). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is experiencing strong momentum fueled by growth in AI semiconductors and continued success with its VMware integration. Strong demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs) has been noteworthy.\n\n\n\nBroadcom’s AI segment benefits from custom accelerators and advanced networking technology that supports large-scale AI deployments with improved performance and efficiency. Broadcom expects third-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 60% year over year to $5.1 billion. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions.\n\n\n\nAs of the fiscal second quarter, roughly 87% of Broadcom’s largest 10,000 customers have adopted VMware Cloud Foundation. However, gross margins in the fiscal third quarter are expected to contract sequentially due to unfavorable revenues and product mix. High debt levels are also a headwind.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the year-to-date period (+6.4% vs. +5.1%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies, with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts, and is indicative of its financial flexibility.\n\n\n\nContinued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The insurer has also started increasing its investment in Japan. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.\n\n\n\nHowever, exposure to cat losses induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind. Also, it remains to be seen how the behemoth fares when Greg Abel succeeds Warren Buffett as CEO of Berkshire.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)\n\n\n\nJohnson & Johnson’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+17.4% vs. +2.6%). The company beat Q2 estimates for earnings and sales. Its Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by key products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and continued uptake of new launches, like Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.\n\n\n\nThough in the MedTech segment, sales are being hurt due to headwinds in China and competitive pressures in some categories, the Cardiovascular segment is contributing to growth. J&J expects sales growth in both segments to be higher in the second half than in the first. J&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline, and has been on an acquisition spree lately.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Stelara patent cliff and the potential impact of Part D redesign will be significant headwinds in 2025. The uncertainty around the talc lawsuits and pharma tariffs lingers.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Oil-Dri Corp. of America have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry over the past year (+81.8% vs. -17.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $840.09 million is well-positioned for long-term growth, driven by a structural shift toward renewable diesel, where its fluids purification segment posted 22% growth for the first nine months of fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nWith expanding capacity across North America, demand for ODC’s solutions is poised to rise, ensuring stable margins and revenue durability. The Ultra Pet acquisition accelerates growth in the pet care segment, expanding the higher-margin crystal litter portfolio. The B2B segment shows strong operating leverage, highlighted by a 43% year-over-year gain in ag product sales.\n\n\n\nWith $36.5 million in cash, low debt, strong cash flow, and no drawdown on its $75 million credit line, ODC retains significant strategic flexibility. A recent stock split enhances liquidity, supporting further investor interest and capitalizing on long-term market trends.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Oil-Dri Corporation of America here >>>)\n\n\n\nPark Aerospace’s shares have gained +40.1% over the past year against the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry’s gain of +50.5%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $354.03 million posted strong Q1 FY26 revenue growth (+10.2% YoY to $15.4M), driven by robust aerospace and defense demand. Key programs like the A321XLR and LEAP-1A, plus defense contracts for missile components, continue to scale up.\n\n\n\nThe company boasts a rock-solid balance sheet with $65.6 million in cash, no debt, and a strong current ratio, enabling self-funded expansion and consistent shareholder returns. Park declared its 41st consecutive annual dividend, with a 3.7% yield and over $603 million returned since FY05. Strategic positioning in next-gen aerospace and defense composites supports long-term demand visibility.\n\n\n\nHowever, rising SG&A costs and customer concentration via non-guaranteed volume contracts pose risks. Broader supply chain delays and inventory build-ups raise concerns about working capital efficiency. Shares trade at 4.6x EV/sales and 22.5x EV/EBITDA.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Park Aerospace here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Las Vegas Sands Corp.

{"id": "217b7730-4522-30da-b71f-ec3f7f53a8aa", "ticker": "AVGO", "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Qualcomm, Broadcom and Intel", "summary": "QCOM eyes an earnings beat with AI-fueled growth and key acquisitions, while AVGO surges and INTC lags behind.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-qualcomm-145000893.html", "published_at": "2025-07-29T14:50:00Z", "source": "Zacks", "text": "In the Quarter under review, Qualcomm was selected by e& a global technology group to strengthen digital infrastructure across the UAE. Under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in advanced AI and 5G technologies to drive nationwide digital transformation. Qualcomm has positioned itself as a key player in that initiative. QCOM has joined forces with HUMAIN to develop AI data centers to deliver cloud-to-edge hybrid AI services. It has formed a partnership with Aramco Digital to support the development of advanced edge AI industrial IoT devices and end-to-end solutions.\n\nDuring the quarter, Qualcomm introduced the cutting-edge Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform. With cutting-edge CPU and GPU capabilities, the solution offers significantly improved AI performance, enhanced gaming, content generation and connectivity features. The newly launched solution has already gained solid market traction. Leading OEMs, such as HONOR and vivo, have already selected the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform for their upcoming devices. Realme is also expected to adopt the new platform.\n\nOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for Qualcomm for the fiscal third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is perfectly the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Qualcomm currently has an ESP of +0.60% with a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chip manufacturer delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.43%, on average, beating estimates on each occasion. In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off an earnings surprise of 0.71%.\n\nQualcomm Inc. is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on July 30, 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is pegged at $10.36 billion and $2.68 per share, respectively. Over the past 60 days, earnings estimate for QCOM for fiscal 2025 has declined 0.26% and for fiscal 2026 it has declined 1.99%.\n\nChicago, IL – July 29, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Intel Corp. INTC.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the third quarter, the company acquired Autotalks to enhance its vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology offerings for safer, smarter transportation systems. Qualcomm has also acquired MovianAI, the former generative AI division of VinAI, a prominent Vietnam-based AI company. The acquisition will give Qualcomm access to VinAI's comprehensive expertise in generative AI, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.\n\nIt has also inked a definitive agreement to acquire Alphawave Semi for an enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion. With advanced technology solutions that are complementary to power-efficient CPU and NPU cores, Alphawave Semi delivers connectivity products and chiplets that drive faster, more reliable data transfer with higher performance and lower power consumption for 5G wireless, AI and data center applications. These acquisitions will significantly bolster Qualcomm's AI capabilities.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nOver the past year, Qualcomm has lost 10.3% against the industry's growth of 41%, lagging peers like Broadcom Inc. but outperforming Intel Corp.. During this period, Broadcom has gained 93.8%, while Intel has declined 32.2%.\n\nKey Valuation Metric\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Qualcomm appears to be relatively cheaper compared to the industry and below its mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 13.44 forward earnings, lower than 34.13 for the industry and the stock's mean of 16.97.\n\nInvestment Considerations\n\nQualcomm is aiming to be the driving force of the next wave of AI innovation. Its recent strategic acquisitions and innovation initiative are perfectly aligned with that strategy. The buyouts will provide Qualcomm's access to next-generation technology, bolster its R&D initiatives, and facilitate the development of state-of-the-art AI-driven solutions for a wide range of industries, including smartphones, PCs, software-defined vehicles and more.\n\nThe company is witnessing healthy traction in the premium handset market. However, intensifying competition from low-cost chip manufacturers like MediaTek and Rockchip is impacting margins in the mid-range smartphone market. The company has been taking actions to counter these issues. It is introducing several cutting-edge AI features in its chips for mid-range smartphones, and it has been actively collaborating with major smartphone manufacturers to develop a solution tailored to their requirements.\n\nQualcomm is also expanding its portfolio offerings to enhance resiliency in its business model. The company is expected to benefit from strong demand for its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform in the automotive market. These factors will likely boost commercial prospects.\n\nHowever, despite some setbacks, Intel has remained a major player in chipset development. The company's growing prowess in the AI PC vertical can pose a challenge to Qualcomm's AI PC expansion. The company is also facing competition from Broadcom, which is a prominent supplier of RF Components to leading smartphone makers.\n\nEnd Note\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #3, QCOM appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution. Intensifying competition in the smartphone vertical is putting pressure on profitability. Declining earnings estimates highlight bearish sentiment.\n\nHowever, the results of a single quarter are not so vital for long-term stakeholders. Investors who already own the stock may consider holding on to it. Qualcomm is ramping up its AI initiatives, diversifying its portfolio to capitalize on the emerging trends across multiple end markets. Growing traction in high-end smartphones, advanced driver assistance, V2X communication, AI PC and IoT space is positive. Strategic buyouts are enhancing portfolio strength. Such development augurs well for long-term sustainable growth.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Broadcom Inc. (AVGO).\n\nBroadcom Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.19, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.19 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 33 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 89.2% and 2.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AVGO\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for AVGO\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Broadcom Inc. here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Broadcom Inc., it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:12:42.100960+00:00"}

(NASDAQ:AVGO) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Broadcom\n\nThe Independent Chairman of the Board, Henry Samueli, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$121m worth of shares at a price of US$188 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$294, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 1.3% of Henry Samueli's stake.\n\nInsiders in Broadcom didn't buy any shares in the last year.

This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Broadcom\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Broadcom insiders own 1.2% of the company, worth about US$16b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:12:45.646347+00:00"}

With cutting-edge CPU and GPU capabilities, the solution offers significantly improved AI performance, enhanced gaming, content generation and connectivity features. The newly launched solution has already gained solid market traction. Leading OEMs, such as HONOR and vivo, have already selected the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform for their upcoming devices. Realme is also expected to adopt the new platform.\n\n\n\nIn the Quarter under review, Qualcomm was selected by e& a global technology group to strengthen digital infrastructure across the UAE. Under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in advanced AI and 5G technologies to drive nationwide digital transformation. Qualcomm has positioned itself as a key player in that initiative. QCOM has joined forces with HUMAIN to develop AI data centers to deliver cloud-to-edge hybrid AI services. It has formed a partnership with Aramco Digital to support the development of advanced edge AI industrial IoT devices and end-to-end solutions.\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter, the company acquired Autotalks to enhance its vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology offerings for safer, smarter transportation systems. Qualcomm has also acquired MovianAI, the former generative AI division of VinAI, a prominent Vietnam-based AI company. The acquisition will give Qualcomm access to VinAI’s comprehensive expertise in generative AI, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.\n\n\n\nIt has also inked a definitive agreement to acquire Alphawave Semi for an enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion. With advanced technology solutions that are complementary to power-efficient CPU and NPU cores, Alphawave Semi delivers connectivity products and chiplets that drive faster, more reliable data transfer with higher performance and lower power consumption for 5G wireless, AI and data center applications. These acquisitions will significantly bolster Qualcomm’s AI capabilities.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:12:49.568958+00:00"}

(AVGO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +7.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Broadcom Inc. belongs, has gained 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nBroadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.66 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +33.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.64 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +36.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.27 indicates a change of +24.7% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Broadcom Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:12:53.971073+00:00"}

These 3 AI Stocks Pay Investors\n\nDividends come with many great perks, with the payouts essentially reflecting a form of 'payday' in the market. Technology sector stocks are often overlooked by income-focused investors, as these companies commonly use spare cash to fuel further growth.\n\nBut perhaps to the surprise of some, several stocks involved closely in the AI trade – Broadcom, Vertiv and NVIDIA – shell out dividend payments. For those interested in getting paid with some AI exposure, let's take a closer look at each.\n\nVertiv Continues Momentum\n\nVertiv provides services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial facilities with a portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services.\n\nAnalysts have dialed their current fiscal year EPS expectations higher over the past year thanks to bullish results stemming from strong demand, with the current $3.56 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting 25% YoY growth.\n\nRevenue estimates are bullish as well thanks to the red-hot demand, with Vertiv expected to see 18% YoY sales growth in its current fiscal year. While hares currently yield a modest 0.1% annually, the stock still reflects a strong play for those seeking a combination of growth and yield.\n\nBroadcom Posts Strong AI Revenue\n\nBroadcom is evolving a broad portfolio of technologies to extend its leadership in enabling next-generation AI infrastructure. This includes foundational technologies and advanced packaging capabilities aimed at building the highest performance, lowest power custom AI accelerators.\n\nThe stock has long been a favorite among those seeking tech exposure paired with paydays, with the company's strong cash-generating abilities allowing it to consistently reward shareholders over its history.\n\nThe company has upped its dividend payout six times over the past five years, translating to a sizable 13.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nNotably, AI revenue of $4.4 billion throughout its latest period showed big momentum, melting 46% higher year-over-year. Its cash-generating abilities also continued to remain strong, with free cash flow of $6.4 billion also reflecting a record and climbing 44% year-over-year.\n\nNVIDIA Remains Prime AI Pick\n\nUnrelenting demand for its Data Center products has provided NVIDIA with unprecedented growth over recent years. The AI favorite again came out with rock-solid results in its latest quarterly print, with Data Center sales of $39.1 billion climbing 73% from the $22.5 billion print in the same period last year.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:12:55.912437+00:00"}

You've got a buy equivalent rating on it, Stacey. Nancy likes that one. Let's talk about Broadcom for a minute because Nancy, this is one that you've liked for a while. Um, do you still like it? What are you going to be looking for from Broadcom, Nancy, going forward?\n\n00:33 Nancy Tengler\n\nYeah, we do, Julie. I mean, it's our largest holding across all of our large cap equity strategies, member of our 12 best, our five for 25. I think, uh, and it's outperformed Nvidia pretty handily over the last year, almost double the returns for Nvidia on a trailing one year. We've always called it the poor man's Nvidia. I think we're going to have to come up with a new name. But one of the things that we're going to be paying attention to is, of course, um, the AI revenues. We we've we've seen those compound at 60 plus percent. They've announced new partnerships. We want to hear more about that. Um, it seems that the rest of the business, the rest of the chip business may have bottomed. We'd like to hear some some information and and confirmation about that. And then I just think, you know, it's just going to be about the future guidance. And Hock Tan has demonstrated he can acquire companies, make them accretive quickly. We bought the stock when, uh, it sold off on the computer associates that used to be the name of the company they acquired. Wall Street didn't like it. They turned it around, made it a very positive acquisition. So we we'll be listening for that, too. Are there any acquisitions they're they're planning to make? And I certainly hope one of them is not Intel.\n\n02:34 Speaker A\n\nYeah, that would be something. Uh, Stacey, um, along with Nvidia, is Broadcom sort of, are those the sort of must-owns in the chip space?\n\n03:05 Stacy Rasgon\n\nYeah, I frankly, in in chips, it hasn't been great outside of AI, right? I mean, AI's been super strong. The analog, more diversified guys, like the people who were playing those on cyclical recovery, some of those prints so far this earning season have not not been so great. There's worries about pull forward and everything else. Again, you got companies like Intel which which frankly are a basket case. I mean, if it wasn't for AI, this space would not be doing very well. So I I do like the AI names. We cover Nvidia and Broadcom. I like them both. Um, Broadcom is is just more expensive than it used to be. That's the only only, you know, it was Right.\n\n04:08 Speaker A\n\nI guess hence Nancy's comment that they're going to have to rename it from the poor man's video.\n\n04:15 Stacy Rasgon\n\nYeah, and look, you know, you got to remember Broadcom like not all that long ago was like 16 times earnings, like now it's like the multiple's like like doubled, right? Um, they are showing a lot of AI upside. A lot of that comes next year, but they they're clearly, I mean even the last earnings call a couple of months ago, they're clearly calling for upside in their AI revenues next year on more inference demand. They're a massive player on AI networking, right? So there's there there's a a big play there. And and and Nancy, I think, is right, they have the core semi business which admittedly has been lousy. They're not the only ones. Everybody in though in those kinds of markets has has been lousy. It it doesn't look like getting any worse at least. I we can we can argue about when it's going to start getting better. I don't know yet, but at least it isn't getting worse. Um, you know, if you're looking in in into the near term, I mean you could argue, again, we we like both stocks. Nvidia is cheaper. And you know, you know, they just they just got their China licenses, um, reinstated, so there's probably more upside to their AI numbers this year for Nvidia versus Broadcom. I think the Broadcom AI upside comes next year and Broadcom's a little more expensive. Um, and then there's a whole ASIC versus, you know, GPU debate. But I I think you can own them both. Like I I I like them both. And again, AI is the only thing in semis right now that fundamentally is really working.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:12:58.266722+00:00"}

The company, commonly known as TSMC, reported second quarter results on July 17, only to remind the market why it is one of the best ways to capitalize on the growth in AI semiconductor demand.\n\nAll the major chip companies, such as Broadcom, Marvell, Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, have been using TSMC's fabrication plants to manufacture their AI chips. Moreover, the chips that go into AI-enabled smartphones are manufactured at TSMC's facilities since it counts the likes of Qualcomm and Apple as customers too.\n\nThis world-class client base and the secular growth of the AI chip market allowed TSMC to deliver outstanding Q2 results and boost its full-year guidance as well. Take a closer look at the latest numbers, and you'll see why it's not too late for investors to buy this hot AI stock.\n\nTSMC's AI-fueled growth is here to stay\n\nTSMC reported an impressive 44% year-over-year increase in its Q2 revenue to $30.1 billion, exceeding the high end of its guidance range. Meanwhile, the company's adjusted earnings per share shot up at a much faster pace of 61%, a testament to its solid pricing power.\n\nTSMC controls 68% of the global semiconductor foundry market, well ahead of its closest rival, Samsung, which has a market share of just under 8%. The company has managed to build such a huge gap over the competition thanks to the technological lead of its process nodes. As a result, TSMC has the ability to raise the prices of its services, and that explains why its gross margin increased by more than five percentage points last quarter from the prior-year period.\n\nImportantly, TSMC is now anticipating its full-year revenue will grow 30% in 2025, up from its earlier estimate of mid-20% growth. But TSMC could end the year with an even bigger top-line jump as it has already achieved 40% year-over-year growth in the first half of 2025, and it is expecting a 38% spike in revenue in the current quarter (at the midpoint of guidance).\n\nWhat's worth noting here is that TSMC says its guidance takes into account the potential impact of tariffs on its business. Even then, the company has raised its full-year outlook, and it won't be surprising to see it end 2025 with a bigger-than-expected jump in revenue and earnings. In fact, TSMC's red-hot growth seems sustainable for a long time to come, considering the secular growth opportunity presented by AI.\n\nThe various AI-focused end-markets that TSMC serves are on track to boom remarkably in the next five years. For instance, the investment in AI chips and computing hardware could exceed a whopping $3 trillion by 2030, according to the consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts are also increasing their estimates for the company's earnings through 2027.\n\nThe stock is built for more upside\n\nTSMC stock has jumped an impressive 59% in the past three months. Even then, it is trading at 28 times trailing earnings as compared to the tech-laden Nasdaq 100 index's average earnings multiple of more than 32. The forward earnings multiple of 24 is even more attractive and is yet another signal of the company's continued bottom-line growth.\n\nInvestors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolios should consider buying TSMC as a top pick. It has room to run higher and is trading at a discount to the broader technology sector, despite quarter after quarter of outstanding execution.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:12:59.898406+00:00"}

Technology sector stocks are often overlooked by income-focused investors, as these companies commonly use spare cash to fuel further growth.\n\nBut perhaps to the surprise of some, several stocks involved closely in the AI trade – Broadcom AVGO, Vertiv VRT, and NVIDIA NVDA – shell out dividend payments. For those interested in getting paid with some AI exposure, let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nVertiv Continues Momentum\n\nVertiv provides services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial facilities with a portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services.\n\nAnalysts have dialed their current fiscal year EPS expectations higher over the past year thanks to bullish results stemming from strong demand, with the current $3.56 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting 25% YoY growth.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRevenue estimates are bullish as well thanks to the red-hot demand, with Vertiv expected to see 18% YoY sales growth in its current fiscal year. While hares currently yield a modest 0.1% annually, the stock still reflects a strong play for those seeking a combination of growth and yield.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s sales on a quarterly basis.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBroadcom Posts Strong AI Revenue\n\nBroadcom is evolving a broad portfolio of technologies to extend its leadership in enabling next-generation AI infrastructure.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Broadcom's ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Broadcom is:\n\n19% = US$13b ÷ US$70b (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2025).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.19 in profit.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Broadcom\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Broadcom's Earnings Growth And 19% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Broadcom seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Broadcom was able to see an impressive net income growth of 21% over the last five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Broadcom's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 11% in the same period, which is great to see.\n\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Past Earnings Growth July 24th 2025\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Broadcom is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:13:27.681543+00:00"}

ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) stock was down over 11% at one point during the trading day July 16 before closing the session down 8.3%.  The company makes advanced lithography machines that chip manufacturers use to produce chips designed by companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/23/asml-stock-sell-off-nvidia-broadcom/", "published_at": "2025-07-23T22:29:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "ASML (ASML 2.81%) stock was down over 11% at one point during the trading day July 16 before closing the session down 8.3%. However, the growth stock continued falling over the next couple of days and is now down 21% over the past year.\n\nThe company makes advanced lithography machines that chip manufacturers use to produce chips designed by companies like Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) and Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%). ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems pack an unprecedented number of transistors into each silicon wafer, advancing precision and lowering manufacturing costs. These machines are the muscle behind the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ASML sell-off, and whether it could have ripple effects that could drag Nvidia and Broadcom down from their all-time highs.\n\nASML's solid results were overshadowed by its guidance\n\nASML reported its most recent quarterly results on July 16. It had a great second quarter and is guiding for 15% revenue growth and slightly higher gross margins for the full year. The semiconductor equipment supplier reaffirmed its 2030 targets, which forecast revenue to increase by 55% to 112% from its 2024 results of 28.3 billion euros ($32.81 billion), and gross margin expansion from the low 50% range to 56% to 60%.\n\nThe margin expansion is likely due to the company's anticipated increase in EUV machines in its sales mix. Right now, its older and less advanced deep ultraviolet machines (DUV) still make up the bulk of new sales. ASML brings in a significant amount of revenue by servicing existing machines for its customers. Margins should grow as the sales mix shifts to more expensive EUV machines -- especially its roughly $400 million ultra-powered high-numerical aperture (high-NA) versions.\n\nThe near-term results and the 2030 targets aren't the issue. Rather, it's a murky medium-term outlook. ASML cited geopolitical challenges and macroeconomic headwinds that are affecting its customers and the timing of their spending.\n\nThe company is directly affected by tariffs on imports to its U.S. manufacturing centers and field operations. ASML also sources components from around the world to build its machines, so it has a complex supply chain that is vulnerable to tariffs.\n\nAlthough ASML is a Dutch company, the Netherlands works closely with the U.S. on trade policy. This limits ASML's ability to sell products to China, despite China's rapidly growing demand for semiconductor lithography systems. As it stands today, ASML can't sell its most advanced systems to China -- just older, lower-cost units.\n\nThere's also the indirect effect of tariffs, which could involve a more severe industrywide slowdown and a shift in customer sentiment. Given the uncertainty, ASML said that it cannot confirm it will grow in 2026. That's likely the reason that the stock is selling off.\n\nNvidia and Broadcom operate upstream of ASML along the AI value chain\n\nASML's latest earnings report and management commentary were a reminder of the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry. Despite widespread enthusiasm and spending on AI, downturns can still happen for geopolitical or macroeconomic reasons, from tariffs and trade policy to interest rates and the timing of the investment cycle.\n\nBefore Nvidia and Broadcom investors start to worry, it's important to remember that ASML operates in a very different sales cycle from those two companies. ASML sold just 76 new lithography units in its latest quarter. That's less than one sale per day. You would be hard-pressed to find a company with a market cap of nearly $290 billion with an order volume that small. But it's a testament to the sophistication of ASML's cutting-edge tech. The company has a virtual monopoly, and its customers are willing to pay a high price for its machines because they're worth it in the long run if they can reduce costs and improve precision. But because these units are so expensive, it's easier for a key customer to decide to delay a purchase by a year or two to wait for more favorable conditions.\n\nIn its latest quarter, ASML said that 35% of new system sales were in Taiwan, while 27% were in China, 19% were in South Korea, 10% were in the U.S., and 9% were in other places. You can bet that the majority of sales in Taiwan are going to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%), South Korea is probably Samsung Electronics (SSNL.F 9.01%), and the U.S. is mostly Intel (INTC 5.59%).\n\nNvidia and Broadcom have international exposure, too. But their sales cycle is far different because they aren't just selling a few big-ticket items every quarter. Nvidia makes most of its money selling graphics processing units (GPUs), software, and associated infrastructure to build AI ecosystems for hyperscalers. Hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%) are raking in the free cash flow and pouring capital expenditures into AI investments -- benefiting Nvidia.\n\nBroadcom is experiencing explosive growth from hyperscalers for its AI chips. But Broadcom does a lot outside AI, from network connectivity to cybersecurity, broadband, wireless, and infrastructure software.\n\nBoth Nvidia and Broadcom have international exposure and are vulnerable to trade tensions and tariff risks, but their sales cycles are distinctly different from ASML's. So ASML's warning of an impending slowdown doesn't necessarily mean the same for Nvidia and Broadcom. However, if fabs (the fabricators) slow down their investment, it could lead to a backlog buildup, which could delay shipments for chip designers.\n\nZooming out in the semiconductor industry\n\nThe sell-off in ASML stock is a reaction to near-term guidance and has nothing to do with the long-term investment. The best way to approach any chip stock, especially ones with expensive valuations like Nvidia and Broadcom, is to take a long-term view, preferably at least three to five years.\n\nIf you believe in the long-term growth of global connectivity and AI and that Nvidia and Broadcom will remain industry leaders, then both stocks are probably worth buying and holding. Even a few quarters or a few years of bad earnings will ultimately be made up for by the long-term investment thesis playing out.\n\nHowever, the further stock prices outpace earnings growth, and the more expensive valuations become, the more hot air fills the stock price, which can go out just as fast as it went in. Therefore, it's essential to approach these stocks with the right mindset and accept that geopolitical and macroeconomic factors can have a massive effect on the stock prices of these companies in the short term.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:13:31.451855+00:00"}

If so, great! You can not only afford to buy growth stocks, but maybe even take some well-calculated risks -- on the right companies, of course. Just stay focused on their long-term prospects when things get a little worrisome in the short run.\n\nHere's a rundown of three brilliant stocks to buy now and hold for a while. Note that all three are proven winners in an industry that has a bright long-term future of its own.\n\nNio\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) business may be hitting a wall here in the United States. That's not the case elsewhere though. In most other parts of the world, EVs are still being increasingly embraced. That's particularly true in China, where, according to a report from industry research outfit Rho Motion, June's sales of battery-powered electric vehicles soared 28% year over year to a record-breaking 1.11 million cars.\n\nThat's 60% of the planet's entire EV sales for the month in question, and about half of China's total automobile sales. And it only gets better from here. The International Energy Agency expects electric vehicles to account for 80% of China's total car sales by 2030.\n\nEnter Nio (NIO -8.45%). Yes, it primarily serves the Chinese market, but no, it's not the market's biggest name. It's not even close, in fact. That honor belongs to BYD, followed distantly by the likes of Wuling, Tesla, Li Auto, and Geely Automobile, just to name a few. Then there's Nio, which delivered a mere 24,925 cars last month, mostly within China.\n\nIts modest market share, however, is a key component of the bullish argument. It's got room to grow by penetrating its home country's fast-growing market. And it is. Nio's total deliveries jumped 17.5% year over year last month, capping off a 25.6% increase for the full quarter. Consumers there are falling in love with its affordable luxury as well as its practical lineup of vehicles, many of which are small SUVs and crossovers.\n\nUnderscoring this argument is the 36% top-line growth analysts expect for this year preceding next year's projected sales growth of 29%, both of which will help push the carmaker closer to profitability. The revenue growth pace, however, could persist for years, if not decades.\n\nBroadcom\n\nMost investors have heard of Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%). Many of these very same investors, however, would struggle to name a single particular piece of technological equipment it makes. The irony? Broadcom's wares are at least as important to the artificial intelligence (AI) industry as those of Nvidia or Arista Networks.\n\nTake its Sian3 DSP PHY (digital signal processor physical layer) as an example. The 3-nanometer optical chip is capable of transmitting digital data at up to 1.6 terabytes per second. Its sixth-generation PCIe switches, meanwhile, make it easy to achieve the interoperability of different kinds of hardware and software that most data centers require.\n\nAnd in January of this year Broadcom unveiled the Brocade G710 24-port 64G switch, which became the data center industry's most power-efficient and lowest-latency SAN (storage area network) switch for data center racks, boasting total bandwidth of up to 1.5 terabytes per second.\n\nIf you're a non-techie and don't know what any of this means, it's simple. Broadcom addresses most of the artificial intelligence industry' biggest technological data bottlenecks besides the one created by data centers' core processors (like the ones Nvidia offers).\n\nThis is no small opportunity either. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan commented in December that he thinks the global market for artificial intelligence processors and their related connectivity technologies could be between $60 billion and $90 billion as soon as 2027, versus Broadcom's 2024 AI-related revenue of $12.2 billion.\n\nThe artificial intelligence hardware business that Broadcom is an integral part of, by the way, is expected to expand at an average annual pace of 26.6% through 2034, according to an outlook from Precedence Research.\n\nRoku\n\nFinally, add Roku (ROKU 2.84%) to your list of brilliant long-term growth stocks to buy. Roku is, of course, the maker of a popular piece of consumer technology that consumers use to access their subscription-based streaming services. It even makes its own branded televisions.\n\nAlthough its TVs and dongles aren't sold all over the world, industry research outfit Pixalate reports Roku enjoys a leading 39% share of North America's streaming device market. It's now concentrating on South America where it's gotten some encouraging traction so far.\n\nAnd yet, it's important to understand that streaming hardware isn't the crux of Roku's business; it's merely a means to an end. The vast majority of this company's revenue and all of its gross profit actually comes from advertising and fees that Roku collects from the streaming service providers in exchange for offering their apps on its platform.\n\nIt's also worth adding that Roku operates one of the free-to-watch, ad-supported channels available through its devices. In fact, TV-ratings outfit Nielsen reports The Roku Channel now garners more U.S. viewing time than Paramount's Paramount+, and just a little less than Amazon's Prime. That's impressive.\n\nRoku's growth isn't likely to hold a candle to the sort of growth that the aforementioned Nio or Broadcom are anytime soon, if ever. But don't dismiss the long-term upside of its position within the business. Although the streaming industry's overall growth is stagnating, Roku's role as one of its technological gatekeepers is actually a very big deal.\n\nIf nothing else, it means that while streaming content's profitability is under pressure due to its increasingly commoditized nature, this company can at least monetize consumers' never ending desire for entertainment.\n\nJust don't tarry if you're interested. As KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson explained of his recent upgrade of Roku stock, \"Roku is turning the corner\" thanks to better advertising solutions and new partnerships (like the recently announced one with Amazon) at a point when advertisers are prioritizing connected-television's reach over traditional cable TV's.\n\nIn fact, for perspective, MNTN Research predicts CTV's ordinary ad revenue will grow to the tune of 10% this year, while cable's is expected to fall by 11%.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:13:38.709031+00:00"}

In addition to some volatility for the broader market, Broadcom stock was pushed lower following news that a large artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure build-out wasn't coming together as quickly as anticipated.\n\nBroadcom stock fell as investors got bad news about Stargate\n\nThe Wall Street Journal published a report today stating that the Stargate Project AI infrastructure company funded by Softbank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX was getting off to a slow start. The partners have pledged $500 billion in funding to build data centers and other AI infrastructure over the next four years, but things are moving slower than anticipated -- and the scope of near-term expansion plans has been narrowed.\n\nBroadcom's networking and connectivity chips and other hardware help support advanced AI processors from Nvidia and other providers, and it's been a huge beneficiary of the AI boom.

The company's positions in connectivity hardware and software services remain strong, and its long-term outlook is promising, but Stargate represents a significant source of potential sales for the business.

It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.95%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company reported an earnings surprise of 8%.\n\n\n\nThe advanced glass substrates producer is likely to have witnessed revenue growth year over year, owing to healthy demand in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments.\n\nFactors at Play for GLW’s Q2 Earnings\n\nDuring the quarter, Corning entered into a multi-year collaboration with Broadcom, a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices. Through this partnership with Corning, Broadcom is aiming to deliver a next-generation co-packaged optics infrastructure designed to enhance the processing capabilities of data centers, marking a significant step toward addressing the growing demands of artificial intelligence workloads. Such strategic partnership is expected to have improved Corning’s prospects in the data center market.\n\n\n\nIn the quarter under review, Corning announced that one of the world’s leading smartphone manufacturer, Samsung has opted to deploy Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 in its Galaxy S25 Edge devices. With crystals embedded within its glass matrix, Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 set a new benchmark of durability and crack deflection capabilities. Such development is expected to have a favorable impact on the second quarter earnings.\n\n\n\nOur revenue estimate for the Optical Communication segment is pegged at $1.47 billion, indicating healthy growth from $1.11 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our revenue estimate for Display Technologies segment is pegged at $919.6 million, indicating a 9.3% year-over-year decline. Revenue estimate for the Specialty Materials segment is pegged at $527 million, up 5.2% year over year.\n\n\n\nFor the June quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.85 billion, indicating growth from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $3.6 billion. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 57 cents, implying an increase from the year-ago quarter’s 47 cents.\n\nEarnings Whispers for GLW\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Corning this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here.\n\n\n\nGLW’s Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%, with both pegged at 57 cents.

More. I want to welcome in John Vin, Equity Research Analyst of Key Bank Capital Markets. John, great to see you as always. Uh maybe start there John, just for a higher level. You think of that mega AI trade and trend John, um and certainly the names chip investors want to play that, so the Nvidias, the Broadcoms. There was some questions about that, John, not too long ago, but now you look at it and it certainly looks resilient, or at least that's how investors are betting on it. But what, what do you see, John?\n\n01:25 John Vin\n\nYeah, I would agree with that. I think the AI chip sector remains uh broadly very resilient. I think there's very uh strong robust demand across the board. And then with the recent news that the US administration now has lifted the AI chip ban uh on chips to China, uh companies like you know, Nvidia and AMD are once again going to be able to start shipping into the China market, which is obviously a very significant market for the AI sector.\n\n02:23 Speaker A\n\nAnd so, John, so do I, do I stick with Nvidia and Broadcom here? Do they remain overweight? Do they remain buys? No, no AI CAPEX peak in sight?\n\n03:01 John Vin\n\nYeah, I would say those are probably the two best positioned companies within the AI chip sector, right? Nvidia, obviously, we think they have a significant commanding lead in the space. The shift to their black wall rack scale GB200 system is is a game changer, really places a lot of distance between them and the competition. Um and then Broadcom, we also think is really well positioned in the AI chip space. I think thematically how we think about it is Broadcom is kind of the leader in the custom AI silicon space, right? Their their largest customer Google TPU by far has one of the most successful custom AI chip solution in the sector. And then they're starting to ramp in the second half year, uh, Meta with their MTIA AI chip, which which also should be an incremental tailwind.\n\n04:54 Speaker A\n\nWhat, what about John, export controls and tariffs? You know, those sort of moving targets here. How should we be thinking through those dynamics as investors?\n\n05:19 John Vin\n\nI think what you're going to see in the near to medium term, right, because these policies um change and are quite dynamic, that I think investors are going to want to understand what the incremental benefit and tailwind related to China shipments are. And I think in the near medium term, until we get better visibility in terms of what the long-term uh policy and geopolitical situation with the US and China is, I I don't think that people are going to uh bank on those China revenues longer term, right? But I think in the near term, you're going to hear Nvidia talk about what its total AI revenues are. I think you're also going to get questions and you're going to get them to ultimately back out what the China contribution is, and I think people are going to keep tabs of that until we get better certainty in terms of the relationships between US and China.\n\n07:02 Speaker A\n\nI also, John, I want your thoughts on Intel, earnings on deck. I know you got the equivalent, John of a hold on that one. How come?\n\n07:21 John Vin\n\nI think they've just got too many challenges, right? And you know, obviously Lip Boo coming in is is a big change and we think is uh for the positive, but um, you know, it's it's going to take a long time. They've got a lot of things ahead of themselves, right? 18A in foundry is is going to be a very long uh long path ahead for them, right? It's going to be several years before they get meaningful revenues. And on the core IDM business, um they're under attack on multiple fronts, right? They're losing share to AMD on servers, they're losing share on client PCs to ARM and they they don't have a credible AI strategy at this point. So obviously they're huge laggards to the rest of the AI chip sector.\n\n08:55 Speaker A\n\nYou mentioned AMD there, John, which has had a nice run, about 30% this year, but I know you got the equivalent of a hold on that one as well.\n\n09:14 John Vin\n\nYeah, we are sector weighted on AMD, um just some concerns about their ability to sustain and compete against Nvidia longer term. But I would say the near-term setup for AMD looks really good. They are ramping their new GPU, the MI355. We think demand is looking extremely robust. We think they're probably on track to do $7 billion in AI revenues this year. Uh service GPU, they just launched their latest generation chip Turin. It's gaining share at Google Cloud, it's ramping quite nicely. And then on the PC space, um they're, they're holding uh their own against Intel there.

Which one of them is leading?", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avgo-vs-okta-enterprise-security-171700344.html", "published_at": "2025-07-21T17:17:00Z", "source": "Zacks", "text": "Broadcom’s security offerings are a part of its broader Infrastructure Software solution that accounted for 44% of revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Infrastructure software revenues jumped 25% year over year to $6.6 billion, bolstered by the successful conversion of enterprise customers to the full VMware Cloud Foundation software stack subscription. AVGO expects infrastructure software revenues to be approximately $6.7 billion, up 16% year over year, in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Broadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency. In April, Broadcom introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). Apart from Infrastructure solutions, strong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASICs, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost.\n\nSo, Broadcom or Okta, which is leading the charge? Let’s find out.\n\nBroadcom AVGO and Okta OKTA are key providers of security software solutions for enterprises. AVGO offers Endpoint Security (Symantec and Carbon Black), Network Security, Information Security, Application Security (Carbon Black) and Identity Security solutions. Meanwhile, OKTA offers cloud-based identity solutions that allow customers to integrate with nearly any application, service or cloud that they choose through its secure, reliable and scalable platforms: Okta Platform and Auth0 Platform. According to Gartner’s latest data, enterprise spending on cybersecurity software and network security will grow 14% in 2025 to $118.5 billion, driven by strong demand for Generative AI (Gen AI) and cloud adoption. IDC expects global cybersecurity spending to grow 12.2% year over year in 2025, driven by increasing complexity and frequency of cyberattacks due to growing deployment of Gen AI and AI, with spending on security software to grow 14.4% year over year. The bullish projections offer significant growth opportunities for both Broadcom and Okta. Both companies are benefiting from strong demand for AI infrastructure, data center build-outs and an increasing threat landscape. Shares of Broadcom and Okta have appreciated 22.2% and 21.1% year to date, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOkta Benefits From Innovative Portfolio\n\nOkta’s offerings include Okta AI, a suite of AI-powered capabilities embedded across several products, which empowers organizations to harness AI to build better experiences and protect against cyberattacks. The company benefits from strong demand for its new products, including Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Device Access, Fine Grained Authorization, Identity Security Posture Management, and Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI.\n\n\n\nOkta is expanding its security portfolio with the launch of a new protocol, Cross App Access, which helps in securing AI agents. The company is working with ISVs in launching Cross App Access that will enable ISVs’ enterprise customers to better connect their AI tools to other apps and data. End users ultimately benefit as the latest protocol removes repetitive authorization consent screens and manages agent access for better security and compliance.\n\n\n\nThe company’s focus on protecting non-human identities (NHIs) and developers building secure agents is noteworthy. NHIs include service accounts, shared accounts, machines and tokens, and often operate outside traditional identity governance frameworks and can leave organizations vulnerable to security risks. Identity Security Posture Management and Okta Privileged Access help in solving the vulnerabilities related to NHIs.\n\nAVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Positive, OKTA’s Steady\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.64 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days, indicating a 36.34% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.\n\n\n\nBroadcom Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nBroadcom Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nBroadcom Inc. price-consensus-chart | Broadcom Inc. Quote\n\nThe consensus mark for Okta’s fiscal 2026 earnings has been steady $3.28 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 16.73% growth over fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\nOkta, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nOkta, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nOkta, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Okta, Inc.

OKTA’s average surprise of 13.53% is significantly better than AVGO’s surprise of 3.2%, reflecting a good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.\n\nValuation: OKTA is Cheaper Than AVGO\n\nIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Broadcom shares are trading at 18.55X, significantly higher than Okta’s 5.6X.\n\n\n\nBoth Okta and Broadcom are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D and Value Score of F.\n\nOKTA and AVGO Valuation\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOkta is a Better Buy Than Broadcom\n\nBroadcom’s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, is a key catalyst. AVGO expects third-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 60% year over year to $5.1 billion on these factors. However, AVGO’s guidance reflects sluggishness in server storage, wireless and industrial businesses. Gross margin is expected to decline roughly 130 basis points sequentially, reflecting a higher mix of XPUs with AI revenues.\n\n\n\nHowever, Okta’s innovative portfolio, along with a strong partner base, is noteworthy. The company has more than 7,000 integrations with cloud, mobile, and web applications and IT infrastructure providers as of April 30, 2025. OKTA exited first-quarter fiscal 2026 with roughly 20,000 customers and $4.084 billion in remaining performance obligations, reflecting strong growth prospects for subscription revenues.\n\n\n\nOkta currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making it a better buy compared with Broadcom, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

AMD, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Broadcom Inc. AVGO. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, NVIDIA and Broadcom have soared 30%, 28.4% and 22.2%, respectively.\n\nYTD Price Return Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis outperformance shows investors are increasingly confident in Micron’s long-term story, even during a volatile market shaped by trade conflicts and geopolitical risks. We believe this momentum is grounded in strong fundamentals, and MU’s long-term outlook justifies a buy position for now.\n\nNew Tech Trends Fuel Micron’s Growth\n\nMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.\n\nAs AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.\n\nThe company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit.

It controls nearly 67% of semiconductor manufacturing, giving it significant pricing power. Being the first to introduce the third-party foundry model also grants TSMC dominance in the chip foundry sector. Regarding dominance, all major players in the industry, such as NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . and Broadcom Inc. , are the key customers of TSMC. Conversely, TSMC’s competitor, Intel Corp. , has faced recent difficulties.\n\nAfter the recent positive quarterly results and an optimistic forecast, TSMC stock popped. TSMC’s shares have outperformed the Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry year to date (+24.2% vs. 20.3%).\n\nBanking on the growing demand for TSMC’s advanced processors for clients, including NVIDIA Corp. and Apple Inc. , the company projected third-quarter revenues between $31.8 billion and $33.0 billion, up 38% year over year. For 2025, TSMC expects revenues to surge nearly 30% when measured in U.S. dollar terms.\n\nTSMC’s second-quarter sales rose as demand for AI chips remained strong. The company’s high-performance computing division, which includes AI and 5G applications, accounted for 60% of the second-quarter revenues. Strong demand for TSMC’s progressive 3nm and 5nm node semiconductor chips also contributed to revenue growth.\n\nOn Thursday, TSMC reported that its net income surged 60.7% year over year to NT$398.27 billion in the second quarter, a record high and significantly higher than estimates. TSMC’s revenues for the June quarter came in at NT$933.80 billion, up 38.7% year on year, and above projections.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. , or TSMC, recently reported a record surge in second-quarter profit as it continues to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend. TSMC is also expected to grow further for three main reasons. Let’s examine those reasons and what makes TSMC stock a compelling buy now.\n\nChicago, IL – July 21, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Apple Inc. AAPL, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Intel Corp. INTC.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTSMC also faces headwinds from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Taiwan is subject to 32% tariffs, with Trump warning of further tariffs on semiconductors. U.S. export controls also restrict TSMC’s business with China. However, recently, NVIDIA and AMD received assurance from the U.S. government to ship products to China, which is a positive development for TSMC as well. Additionally, TSMC is expanding beyond Taiwan, with plans to establish manufacturing plants in Japan, Germany and the United States soon.\n\nManufacturing a semiconductor plant is not easy; it involves a complex and cumbersome process. The technology is not only intricate but also requires significant capital investment. As a result, many advanced companies have chosen not to build their facilities and instead rely on TSMC. This high barrier to entry has helped TSMC keep potential rivals at bay.\n\nTSMC Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist\n\nWhile encouraging second-quarter results boosted TSMC’s stock price, the company is primed for growth in the years ahead due to its competitive advantages, expansion efforts and significant barriers to entry in the semiconductor industry, where it already holds a dominant position.\n\nBrokers are also optimistic about the company’s prospects. They predict TSMC stock’s average short-term price target at $244.75, reflecting a 3% increase from the last closing price of $237.56. The highest target stands at $270, suggesting a potential upside of 13.7%.\n\nAdditionally, the $9.54 Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSMC’s earnings per share has increased 15.5% annually. TSMC, therefore, rightfully holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Pinterest has turned to AI to help make its platform much more attractive to both users and advertisers.  Toast is helping restaurants become more successful and is benefiting from its customers' growth.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/21/5-red-hot-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/", "published_at": "2025-07-21T08:51:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Growth stocks continue to drive the market higher, led by companies in the technology sector. With the market heating up, now is still a great time to add some growth names to your portfolio.\n\nLet's look at five great options to buy this year.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nWhile a distant second to Nvidia in the graphics processing unit (GPU) space, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%) has found a niche in the inference market. For example, last quarter it said one of the largest artificial intelligence (AI) model companies in the world was using its GPUs to run a significant portion of its daily inference. This is important, as the inference market is eventually expected to greatly outgrow the market for training.\n\nThis is a huge opportunity for AMD given its smaller size. In the first quarter, Nvidia's data center revenue topped $39 billion, while AMD's was just $3.7 billion. Because of this, even small market share gains could result in huge growth.\n\nTo help with this, the company is part of consortium -- along with Intel, Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), and many others -- that has created a new open interconnect standard called UALink to compete with Nvidia's proprietary NVLink standard. If UALink becomes the new standard, it would enable customers to mix and match AI chips from different vendors. That would be a huge victory for AMD.\n\nWith inference demand poised to overtake training and AMD's clear growth runway, this is a stock that still has plenty of room to run.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nInstead of chasing Nvidia in the GPU market like AMD, Broadcom is focused on custom chips and networking infrastructure. The company's networking portfolio has seen strong growth, as its components are important in helping transfer massive data volumes across huge AI clusters. This led to its AI networking revenue surging 70% in Q1.\n\nIts biggest opportunity, though, lies in custom AI chips. Broadcom helped Alphabet design its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and it is now working with several major hyperscalers (owners of massive data centers) on their own custom chips. Given the upfront costs of designing custom chips, these tend to be for big deployments. Broadcom has said that its three custom chip customers furthest along represent a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market opportunity in fiscal 2027 alone.\n\nNot to be overlooked is Broadcom's acquisition of VMware. Its Cloud Foundation platform is becoming an essential tool for managing AI workloads across hybrid and multicloud environments. Since the acquisition, Broadcom has moved VMware to a subscription model, creating a nice recurring revenue stream.\n\nWith AI networking, custom chips, and virtualization, Broadcom is turning into a premier AI company.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.77%) is at the heart of the global semiconductor supply chain. It manufactures the world's most advanced semiconductors for the top chip designers in the world. Its unmatched scale and technological expertise have created a moat in the manufacturing of advanced chips.\n\nRival Intel continues to burn cash trying to build a foundry business, while Samsung's yield issues have given TSMC a massive lead in the advanced-node space. Nodes refer to the size of the transistors used on a chip, measured in nanometers.\n\nSmaller nodes, which improve chip performance and power efficiency, are driving TSMC's growth. Chips built on 7nm technology and below account for the vast majority of TSMC's revenue, and Apple has locked up a large chunk of its future 2nm output. Even Intel has tapped TSMC's 3nm technology for some of own high-end chips.\n\nDemand for AI chips isn't slowing and autonomous driving has the potential to be the next big semiconductor market. At the end of the day it doesn't matter who wins the battle for AI chips, TSMC is positioned to benefit regardless.\n\n4. Pinterest\n\nPinterest (PINS 1.80%) has been working behind the scenes to transform its online vision board into a more shoppable platform that is becoming increasingly attractive to brands and advertisers. A big part of this push is coming from AI.\n\nIt built a multimodal AI model that understands both images and text. This allows the company to better personalize content, while also helping power its new visual search tool. With visual search, users can now click on specific part of an image, such as a handbag a woman is holding, and find direct checkout links to retailers for that exact bag or ones that are similar. These efforts have helped turn Pinterest into a more transactional platform.\n\nThe front end isn't the only area that Pinterest has focused on. It's looking for its new AI-driven advertising solution, Performance+, to help growth moving forward. Performance+ uses AI and automation to make advertising on its platform less labor intensive and more effective. It helps advertisers with everything from creative to ad targeting, bidding, and budget optimization.\n\nPinterest has a massive global user base, which arguably has long been under-monetized. If the company can continue execute on its vision, the stock has a lot of upside ahead.\n\n5. Toast\n\nToast (TOST 1.97%) is more than just a restaurant point-of-sale system, it's becoming the software backbone for the restaurant industry.\n\nThe company continues to roll out new tools designed to streamline operations and help increase restaurant sales. Recent launches include AI features like ToastIQ and its \"sous chef\" assistant, which can help restaurants make better decisions and improve the customer experience.\n\nMeanwhile, Toast benefits directly from restaurant success. It earns a cut of customer sales via payment processing, so every operational improvement that drives more sales also helps Toast. The company added more than 6,000 new restaurant locations in Q1, and is now serving more than 140,000 sites.\n\nImportantly, it's starting to expand beyond local restaurants.

Two of the most exciting were in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), the world's No. 1 AI chip designer, and Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), a networking giant, completed stock splits in June and July 2024, respectively.\n\nWhat is a stock split, and why do companies go this route? These operations enable a company to bring down a soaring stock price to more reasonable levels, making the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors. Nvidia and Broadcom even said they decided on splits to make it easier for employees and investors to get in on their shares, which had surged more than 200% and about 100%, respectively, in 2023.\n\nStock splits don't change the total market value of the company or anything fundamental, though. They simply involve offering more shares to current holders according to the ratio of the split. So, for example, in a 10-for-1 stock split, if you originally held one share, you would hold 10 shares post-split -- but the total value of your holding would remain the same.\n\nBecause of this, a stock split alone isn't a reason to buy or sell a stock. Still, it's interesting to see how stock split players have performed a year after these operations, so let's take a look at both Nvidia and Broadcom a year after their splits.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia completed its 10-for-1 stock split on June 7 of last year, with shares trading at the split-adjusted price as of June 10. This brought the shares down from about $1,200 to $120. Since that time, Nvidia stock has experienced ups and downs, but it's delivered a gain of more than 40%.\n\nAs mentioned, this operation isn't the reason investors have flocked to Nvidia over the past year (though a lower price per share may have made it easier for some to get in on the growth story). What has driven Nvidia's share price performance is the ongoing high demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), or AI chips, and related products and services.\n\nWhat also helped this AI leader was its strong execution of a big launch: Nvidia released its Blackwell architecture and chip this past winter to demand that CEO Jensen Huang called \"insane.\" The company generated $11 billion in revenue from Blackwell in its very first quarter of commercialization and maintained a gross margin above 70%, ensuring high profitability on sales.\n\nAlthough investors worried about potential headwinds, such as import tariffs or a decrease in AI spending, these concerns have eased. Trade talks have spurred optimism that tariffs may not be as hefty as initially expected, and companies have reiterated their AI investment plans. All of this helped boost Nvidia's shares in recent weeks, even pushing the company to a $4 trillion market cap, making it the first company ever to reach this level.\n\nBroadcom\n\nBroadcom executed its stock split on July 12, and the stock began trading on July 15 at the new price. Like Nvidia, the company decided on a 10-for-1 split to bring its share price down -- in this case, from about $1,700 to $170. Broadcom stock has also climbed in the double digits since the operation, rising more than 65%.\n\nAnd like Nvidia, Broadcom saw its shares take off thanks to demand from AI customers. This company is a networking leader, making thousands of products used in a variety of locations -- from your smartphone to major data centers. But in recent times, demand from big cloud service providers to support their AI development has helped revenue skyrocket.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, AI revenue surged 77% to $4.1 billion, and the company says it expects this momentum to continue in the current quarter and through the next fiscal year. This is amid demand for both connectivity products and Broadcom's accelerated processing units (XPUs), a type of processor for specific AI tasks.\n\nThe company says its networking expertise and wide range of products -- from switches and routers to network interface cards (NICs), which connect computers to networks -- have been key growth drivers as cloud service providers ramp up their AI platforms.\n\nBroadcom stock followed a similar path to Nvidia, declining in April of this year due to general tariff concerns, but it has also rebounded and is on the rise today. The stock even closed at a record high just a few days ago.\n\nCould the post-split success continue?\n\nBoth Nvidia and Broadcom have completed successful post-split years, scoring double-digit gains. Nvidia is slightly less expensive from a valuation standpoint than it was a year ago, but Broadcom's valuation has advanced.\n\nStill, these AI players remain reasonably priced, considering their earnings track record and long-term prospects in this growth market. It's impossible, of course, to guarantee what these stocks will do next, but the current environment supports the idea of more gains ahead. Even more importantly, Nvidia and Broadcom are well positioned to win in the AI market over the long run.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:14:09.748563+00:00"}

While the best companies are hard to find, but they can generate massive returns over long periods. To wit, the Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) share price has soared 827% over five years. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. On top of that, the share price is up 70% in about a quarter. Anyone who held for that rewarding ride would probably be keen to talk about it.\n\nSince the stock has added US$42b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nOver half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 37% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 56% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 100.65.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNasdaqGS:AVGO Earnings Per Share Growth July 20th 2025\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Broadcom's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Broadcom the TSR over the last 5 years was 944%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:14:11.768271+00:00"}

Of that, $5 trillion will be due to the rising processing power demands of artificial intelligence (AI). These investments, though, will lay the groundwork for the next era of global innovation, which will revolutionize existing industries and create new ones.\n\nSome key companies have already been experiencing significant growth due to the AI trend, and there is still likely a long runway ahead for players in key AI infrastructure spaces, including semiconductors, cloud computing, and networking.\n\nHere are five top stocks to buy and hold for the next wave of AI innovation.\n\nNvidia: The data center AI chip leader\n\nInside these colossal AI data centers are many thousands of AI accelerator chips, usually from Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the only ones that can make use of its proprietary CUDA platform, which contains an array of tools and libraries to help developers build and deploy applications that use the hardware efficiently. CUDA's effectiveness -- and its popularity with developers -- has helped Nvidia win an estimated 92% share of the data center GPU market.\n\nThe company has maintained its winning position as it progressed from its previous Hopper architecture to its current Blackwell chips, and it expects to launch its next-generation architecture, with a CPU called Vera and a GPU called Rubin, next year. Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow to $200 billion this year and $251 billion in 2026.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft: Winning in AI through the cloud\n\nAI software is primarily trained and powered through large cloud data centers, making the leading cloud infrastructure companies vital pieces of the equation. They're also Nvidia's largest customers. Amazon (AMZN 0.08%) Web Services (AWS) has long been the world's leading cloud platform, with about 30% of the cloud infrastructure market today.Through the cloud, companies can access and deploy AI agents, models, and other software throughout their businesses.\n\nAWS's sales grew by 17% year over year in Q1, and it should maintain a similar pace. Goldman Sachs estimates that AI demand will drive cloud computing sales industrywide to $2 trillion by 2030. Amazon will capture a significant portion of that, and since AWS is Amazon's primary profit center, the company's bottom line should also thrive.\n\nIt's a similar theme for Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%). Its Azure is the world's second-largest cloud platform, with a market share of approximately 21%. Microsoft stands out from the pack for its deep ties with millions of corporate clients. Businesses rely on Microsoft's range of hardware and software products, including its enterprise software, the Windows operating system, and productivity applications such as Outlook and Excel.\n\nMicrosoft's vast ecosystem creates sticky revenue streams and provides it with an enormous customer base to cross-sell its AI products and services to. Microsoft has also invested in OpenAI, the developer behind ChatGPT, and works with it extensively, although that relationship has become somewhat strained as OpenAI has grown increasingly successful.\n\nRegardless, Microsoft's massive footprint across the AI and broader tech space makes it a no-brainer.\n\nArista Networks and Broadcom: The networking tech that underpins AI\n\nWithin data centers, huge clusters of AI chips must communicate and work together, which requires them to transfer massive amounts of data at extremely high speeds. Arista Networks (ANET 2.57%) sells high-end networking switches and software that help accomplish this. The company has already thrived in this golden age of data centers, with top clients including Microsoft and Meta Platforms, which happen to also be among the highest spenders on AI infrastructure.\n\nArista Networks will likely continue benefiting from growth in AI investments, as these increasingly powerful AI models consume ever-increasing amounts of data. Analysts expect Arista Networks to generate $8.4 billion in sales this year (versus $7 billion last year), then $9.9 billion next year, with nearly 19% annualized long-term earnings growth.\n\nTightly woven into this same theme is Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), which specializes in designing semiconductors used for networking applications.\n\nFor example, Arista Networks utilizes Broadcom's Tomahawk and Jericho silicon in the networking switches it builds for data centers. Broadcom's AI-related semiconductor sales increased by 46% year-over-year in the second quarter.\n\nLooking further out, Broadcom is becoming a more prominent role player in AI infrastructure. It has designed custom accelerator chips (XPUs) for AI model training and inference. It has struck partnerships with at least three AI customers that management believes will each deploy clusters of 1 million accelerator chips by 2027. Broadcom's red-hot AI momentum has analysts estimating the company will grow earnings by an average of 23% annually over the next three to five years.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:14:13.193157+00:00"}

His Appaloosa Management hedge fund has produced gross annualized returns of more than 28% since its inception in 1993. That far outpaces the S&P 500's annualized return over the last 32-plus years of about 10.6%.\n\nTepper is best known for buying distressed debt from companies close to bankruptcy. In fact, Appaloosa was considered a junk bond investment boutique in the 1990s. That contrarian approach often extends to his stock portfolio as well.\n\nThat said, he's not so set on swimming against the current that he won't buy stocks that are part of an obvious trend like artificial intelligence (AI). AI stocks like Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%) have soared in value over the last few years. And Tepper made quite a bit of money on those stocks.\n\nBut he's been selling them recently in favor of another AI chipmaker instead, possibly taking a bit of a contrarian stance against the two big GPU makers.\n\nThe essential infrastructure behind the AI revolution\n\nGraphics processing units (GPUs) are computer chips or systems that have proven exceptionally adept at crunching all the data that goes into training and running large language models. GPUs are designed to do the types of calculations needed for training AI algorithms, and they can run the processes in parallel, making them far more efficient than a standard CPU, which uses serial processing.\n\nNvidia has long been a leader in GPUs, dating back to the days when they were mostly just used for high-end visuals in gaming (hence why the G stands for \"graphics\"). As the processing needs of large language models grew exponentially larger, it's seen incredible demand for its leading GPU systems.\n\nEven after the strong growth in 2023 and 2024, Nvidia's data center revenue climbed another 73% year over year last quarter. With strong operating leverage, the company has seen its earnings zoom higher, and investors have rewarded it. It's now the most valuable company in the world by a substantial margin, worth over $4 trillion.\n\nBut AMD is starting to make progress in catching up to Nvidia. The company's MI400 chips coming next year could offer better price performance than Nvidia's current Blackwell line of chips. While Nvidia will be on to its next-generation Vera Rubin platform by then, AMD is offering Nvidia's biggest customers a viable alternative, which could keep its pricing from climbing substantially higher.\n\nAMD's stock hasn't performed nearly as well as Nvidia's. After peaking in early 2024, the stock crashed more than 60% to its low in April this year. The first quarter could have been a great opportunity to buy the stock, especially for a contrarian investor looking to take a stance against Nvidia's continued dominance.\n\nBut Tepper sold his entire stake in AMD during the first quarter, a position first established in the second quarter of 2023. He also continued to cut his Nvidia stake, leaving him with just 3% of the shares he held for Appaloosa in mid-2023. Instead, he's betting on a different chipmaker that poses an increasing threat to the dominance of GPUs in AI data centers.\n\nThe AI chipmaker Tepper's buying instead\n\nWhile GPUs are extremely flexible and capable of handling all sorts of tasks, many of the biggest companies developing leading-edge AI capabilities are working on custom-made silicon that can handle specific tasks far more efficiently than power-hungry GPUs. These application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, represent a significant threat to GPUs, as hyperscalers like Meta Platforms and Alphabet's Google design more advanced chips capable of handling AI training and inference.\n\nThe capabilities of ASICs are expanding. Meta says its custom chips, which have historically handled machine learning AI, are expanding to training large language models after starting with machine learning algorithms and moving on to AI inference. Google trained its large language model Gemini on its own chip designs, and it just released its first Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) designed for AI inference in April.\n\nThe company helping Meta and Google design their ASICs is Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%). On top of that ASIC business, Broadcom is also the leading networking chipmaker. Networking is an essential piece of AI data centers, as solid network performance ensures all the data gets to the expensive GPUs or ASICs quickly and efficiently. These businesses are spending billions on those chips, so they don't want them sitting idly any longer than necessary.\n\nBroadcom also has an enterprise software business, led by virtual machine software VMWare.\n\nThat is to say, Broadcom offers a more diversified chipmaker compared to Nvidia or even AMD (which also has a strong CPU business). That may be why Tepper took a small stake in the company during the first quarter, as it's a leading competitor in AI chips while offering some downside protection with its VMWare business.\n\nStill, Broadcom stock is expensive. It trades for a forward earnings multiple close to 40. That's right in line with Nvidia and slightly less expensive than AMD. The company arguably holds more upside if ASIC designs capture more real estate in data centers over time. Consider the potential efficiency gains of ASICs versus GPUs, which seems likely to happen in the long run.\n\nBut investors may have to settle for more slow and steady growth compared to Nvidia or AMD. As such, it's worth keeping an eye on Broadcom's stock to see if it falls back down to a more attractive price before following Tepper into the stock.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:14:14.855683+00:00"}

In 10 years, shares of Broadcom have risen by more than 2,000%, while the S&P 500 has increased by around 200%.\n\nCan Broadcom's impressive gains continue?\n\nAs of the end of last week, Broadcom's stock was up around 19% for the year, which was comfortably above the S&P 500's returns of more than 6%. But with a valuation of around $1.3 trillion and Broadcom trading at 33 times its estimated future earnings (based on analyst estimates), it's not a cheap stock to own.\n\nThe biggest risk is that the company relies heavily on demand from hyperscalers. These are big tech giants that have significant infrastructure needs related to tech and AI. If they scale back on their expenditures, that could significantly weigh on Broadcom's results. The company estimates that its top five customers account for around 40% of its revenue.\n\nThe company's revenue during the most recent reported period -- which ended on May 4 -- grew by a rate of 20% year over year, as its top line came in at just over $15 billion, while profits more than doubled, rising to nearly $5 billion.\n\nIf Broadcom can continue producing strong results such as these, it wouldn't be surprising to see it outperform the market once again this year. Though that risk of hyperscalers cutting spending remains.\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy right now?\n\nIf you're bullish on AI and expect there to be much more growth ahead, Broadcom can make for a compelling investment to simply buy and hold. But at the same time, it's also important to consider the risks ahead, especially as tariffs and trade wars could impact growth in the tech sector in the near future.\n\nEarlier this year, Broadcom's stock was underperforming the S&P 500 due to the uncertainty in the markets. While that looks like a distant memory right now, investors should brace for a possible slowdown for the stock as it's trading at an elevated valuation and it may be due for a decline. Its track record may be impressive, but that by no means guarantees it'll always be a market-beating stock.\n\nI'd hold off on buying shares of Broadcom only because the markets appear to be a bit too bullish right now, and with high expectations priced in, there's a lot of downside risk that comes with owning the stock. Broadcom isn't a bad buy, but I think there are better AI stocks to invest in today.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:14:16.375375+00:00"}

But recent earnings results show that top semiconductor companies are still well positioned to deliver outstanding returns for long-term investors.\n\nThe AI chip market is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 24% through 2029 to reach $311 billion, according to MarketsandMarkets. If you have $3,000 you're looking to invest right now, here are two chip stocks to consider buying and holding for the long term.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.52%) has become a widely used brand of chips in the consumer PC market. Its Ryzen processors have taken significant market share from Intel. But it's also one of only two suppliers, along with Nvidia, of general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used for AI workloads.\n\nWhile Nvidia has a commanding lead in GPUs, it's not going to control 100% of the market. This leaves a substantial opportunity for the runner-up in this market to do well. AMD's data center business is booming, with segment revenue up 57% year over year in the first quarter.\n\nAMD is meeting demand for cost-effective alternatives in the chip market. Oracle is experiencing tremendous growth in its cloud infrastructure business right now, and it's a key partner for AMD. Oracle's cloud infrastructure will offer up to 131,072 AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs for AI. AMD has already announced the MI400 series for launch next year, which will enable even better performance for AI training and inferencing.\n\nAs data center sales make up a larger mix of AMD's total revenue, it is pushing margins up. Higher margins drove a 55% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings last quarter. Given the long-term opportunity in the AI chip market, which AMD estimates at $500 billion, investors are undervaluing AMD's future earnings.\n\nThe stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 38 on 2025 earnings estimates. But this multiple drops to 25 on 2026 estimates. As AMD continues to expand margins from growth in its data center business, the stock could offer significant upside over the next few years and beyond.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nBeyond the surging demand for general-purpose chips that AMD supplies, there is growing demand for chips designed for specialized tasks. Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%) is one of the best stocks to profit from the demand for custom chip solutions.\n\nBroadcom has been a top-performing semiconductor company for years, supplying components for many markets, including Apple's iPhone. But demand for its application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for AI is off the charts.\n\nThe company's AI chip revenue grew 46% year over year in the most recent quarter. As demand for custom ASICs grows, it also fuels demand for networking products that can handle faster data transfer, which is needed for next-level AI performance.\n\nBroadcom's new Tomahawk 6 Ethernet switch has enough data capacity to support 100,000 AI chips working together to train the next-generation AI models. The company's networking business posted revenue growth of 170% year over year last quarter, representing 40% of its AI-related revenue.\n\nHowever, management sees the demand for its custom AI chips outpacing sales of its networking products over time. It's a huge opportunity, as evidenced by Broadcom's momentum. Management expects its AI growth to remain steady through fiscal 2026, which could support new highs for the stock.\n\nBroadcom earns very high margins, so the favorable demand outlook points to robust earnings over the next year. The stock trades at 41 times this year's consensus earnings estimate, but that multiple drops to 33 on next year's estimate. These are not cheap valuation multiples, but the investment in AI technology is pointing to substantial growth in the coming years for leading chipmakers, and that should support excellent returns for investors.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:14:22.603658+00:00"}

The continent’s largest companies are increasingly outpaced by their US counterparts—particularly in the rapidly evolving technological sector.\n\nWhile the broader European equity market has outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, the continent’s corporate heavyweights are falling behind in the global stock market hierarchy. The gap highlights a deeper transatlantic divide in innovation, private capital, and long-term competitiveness.\n\nAs of mid-July, the combined market capitalisation of Europe’s seven largest listed firms — SAP, Novo Nordisk, Hermès, ASML, LVMH, Roche and Nestlé — stands at $2.2 trillion (€1.73tr), virtually flat year-to-date.\n\nThat puts the combined market cap of US 7 largest companies at $18,8 trillion vs. of EU’s largest.\n\nBy contrast, the US ‘Magnificent Seven’ — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Broadcom (instead of Tesla) — have reached a cumulative valuation of $18.8tr (€16.12tr), up 10.2% since the start of the year.\n\nTech dominance defines the US-EU divergence\n\nThe divergence reflects the central role of technology and artificial intelligence in today’s equity market leadership.\n\nSeven out of seven of the largest US companies are technology firms with significant exposure to AI infrastructure, cloud computing or data platforms.\n\nIn Europe, just two companies in the top seven — SAP and ASML — are active in the technology sector, with the remainder concentrated in luxury goods, pharmaceuticals and consumer staples.\n\nNvidia alone is valued at €3.59 trillion, larger than the combined market cap of Europe’s top seven. Its dominance is tied to its role in powering AI infrastructure worldwide, from model training to real-time inference.\n\n“While the others use AI to power their platforms and services, Nvidia supplies the very foundation on which those ambitions are built,” said Natalie Hwang, founder of Apeira Capital, in an emailed comment.\n\n“It quietly enables the success of every other member of the Magnificent Seven, while remaining their most indispensable partner.”\n\nAccording to industry estimates, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are set to spend over $320 billion (€294 billion) on AI infrastructure in 2025, much of it focused on inference optimisation and hyperscale data centres.\n\nJP Morgan Chase's message to Europe: 'You’re losing'\n\nJP Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon reinforced the broader concerns over Europe’s global position during remarks at a recent event in Dublin hosted by the Irish foreign ministry.\n\n“Europe has gone from 90% of US GDP to 65% over 10 or 15 years. That’s not good,” Dimon said. “You’re losing.”\n\nHe pointed to overregulation, fragmentation, and weak productivity as structural weaknesses, and urged European leaders to act on the 2024 report led by former ECB President Mario Draghi, which recommended €800 billion in annual investment to strengthen industrial competitiveness.\n\nDimon added: “We’ve got this huge, strong market and our companies are big and successful, have huge kinds of scale that are global. You have that, but less and less.”\n\nA moment of reckoning\n\nThe diverging fortunes of the Magnificent Seven and Europe’s corporate champions symbolise a broader transatlantic imbalance—not just in technology, but in economic dynamism.\n\nWhile Europe’s top firms are respected global brands, they are increasingly eclipsed by American companies that are not only growing faster but also shaping the future. The AI race has become a litmus test for global economic relevance.\n\nIf Europe is to keep pace, it must resolve its innovation shortfall, energise private investment, and modernise regulation.\n\nOtherwise, as Dimon put it bluntly: “You’re losing.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:14:30.759566+00:00"}

This policy shift comes after April's export ban blocked chips such as Nvidia’s H20 AI accelerator and AMD's MI308.\n\n“This is a game changer,” Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, told Yahoo Finance. “Nvidia stands to gain billions in annual revenue from China, and every Nvidia supplier is going to benefit, as well as second and third derivative plays.”\n\nBank of America (BAC) raised its price targets for Nvidia and AMD to $220 and $175, respectively, in anticipation of license approval.

The momentum stalled in the second quarter, but could quickly return if policy changes are confirmed.\n\nThe semiconductor market is rapidly expanding as AI advances. Gaining approval and reopening the key Chinese market, even partially, shifts sentiment across the sector. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated the Chinese AI market is worth $50 billion.\n\nStill, the exact effect on balance sheets will be hard to pin down in the near term. Nvidia’s first quarter earnings reported a $2.5 billion drop in China revenue and a $4.5 billion inventory write-off. An additional $8 billion loss is anticipated in the second quarter.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:14:41.299130+00:00"}

From chip giants such as Nvidia and Broadcom to software specialists such as Palantir Technologies and SoundHound AI, investors will have to pay huge premiums if they are looking to add a top AI stock to their portfolios right now.\n\nHowever, there's one company that's not just trading at an extremely attractive valuation, but is growing at an incredible pace as well thanks to AI: Micron Technology (MU 3.26%). Let's see why investors would do well to buy this stock now.\n\nData centers, smartphones, and computers are fueling this chipmaker's terrific growth\n\nMicron Technology manufactures and sells memory and storage chips that are deployed in AI graphics cards, personal computers (PCs), and smartphones. This makes the company one of the best bets on the secular growth of the AI hardware market.\n\nAfter all, AI chips used in data centers are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), since they can provide substantially higher bandwidth and lower latency. These properties allow HBM chips to quickly transport a lot of data in comparison to legacy memory chips, making them ideal for tackling AI workloads.\n\nMicron management points out that the company has \"deep relationships with practically every major customer of HBM.\" Third-party reports suggest the same, indicating that Micron sells its HBM to the top four AI chipmakers that produce both GPUs and custom AI processors. The company is reportedly looking to corner a fourth of the HBM market by the end of the year, and that could translate into a nice increase in Micron's revenue and earnings.\n\nAfter all, the HBM market's revenue is expected to almost double in 2025, generating $35 billion in sales, per Micron's estimates. What's more, the HBM market's revenue is expected to hit $100 billion by 2030. Assuming Micron can sustain a 25% share of this space, HBM alone could contribute around $25 billion to its top line after five years (based on the $100 billion revenue estimate mentioned earlier).\n\nThat would give Micron's growth a big boost, considering that the company has generated just under $34 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. Meanwhile, additional growth is likely to come from the PC and smartphone markets, where the demand for memory is increasing on account of a bump in the average dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) content, thanks to AI.\n\nFor instance, the mobile DRAM market's revenue could jump sixfold over the next decade, generating more than $636 billion in revenue, as AI and machine learning (ML) applications will lead to an increase in the amount of compute memory required in smartphones. Importantly, this isn't where Micron's list of catalysts ends.\n\nThe company says that it occupied the second spot in the data center solid-state drive (SSD) market in the first quarter. Again, this could turn out to be a huge positive for Micron in the future, as the data center SSD market's size is expected to grow by over 7x through 2033 from last year's levels.\n\nIn all, it is easy to see that Micron has solid secular growth opportunities that could help it remain a top growth stock in the long run, and that's why buying the stock right now is a great idea, considering its valuation.\n\nThe biggest reason to buy Micron stock hand over fist\n\nConsensus estimates are expecting a 6x jump in Micron's earnings in the current fiscal year, which will end next month. This astronomical growth can be attributed to skyrocketing memory prices caused by tremendous end-market demand -- fueled by AI -- in the multiple areas discussed. What's more, Micron is expected to clock a 54% jump in earnings in the next fiscal year as well.\n\nThe good part is that investors can buy Micron stock at just 22 times earnings. That's a steal, considering that the U.S. technology sector has an average earnings multiple of 51. Another thing worth noting here is that Micron is undervalued when we take into account its long-term earnings growth potential.\n\nThe stock has a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.15, based on its five-year projected earnings growth, per Yahoo! Finance. The PEG ratio is a forward-looking valuation metric that's calculated by dividing a stock's earnings multiple by its estimated annual earnings growth rate over the next five years. A reading of less than 1 means that a stock is undervalued when its future growth is considered.\n\nMicron's PEG ratio suggests that it is significantly undervalued. So, this AI stock is a no-brainer buy right now, as the remarkable growth that it has been clocking of late seems here to stay for a long time.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:14:42.826704+00:00"}

The company uses agentic AI to help engineers meet the challenges presented by the latest chip designs, and its generative AI platform has the potential to transform semiconductor chip design. Finally, Cadence’s AI IP platform provides comprehensive solutions in the worlds of IP and software.\n\nCadence’s solutions include 3D-IC design, 5G systems, Artificial Intelligence and generative AI, an extensive cloud portfolio, data center design, multiphysics systems analysis – it’s a long list, as Cadence has connections across the tech world. Its products and tech are used in a wide range of essential secondary products, including silicon chips, integrated circuit boards – items that are used everywhere from the aerospace sector to the life sciences, and including plenty of AI applications.\n\nThe first stock on our radar here is Cadence Design, a high-tech firm from San Jose, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Cadence provides the technology and support necessary for some of our world’s most important industries to thrive. The company uses its Intelligent Design System to develop its products and software, and its services are in high demand everywhere from the chip industry to the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nSchneider follows on from these comments by tagging two chip names that deserve a closer look. It doesn’t hurt that both stocks also carry Strong Buy ratings from the broader Street, according to the TipRanks database . Let’s take a closer look.\n\nCovering the fields of tech, AI, and semiconductors, Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider points out the contours of the field and its opportunities, writing: “We believe the AI investment cycle is in a state of transition, with over $350bn in CapEx spent on AI infrastructure. Although monetization has been elusive, we see early signs of incremental revenue and much clearer evidence of cost takeout to justify these investments – and we believe AI CapEx can sustain growth from current levels.”\n\nAI might exist in a data cloud, but it requires hardware. The AI companies need data centers, high-performance computers, and advanced networking – and all of that requires silicon semiconductors, many of them custom-designed. Chip giant Nvidia, with its $4 trillion market cap, is the 800-pound gorilla in this room, but there are other names that investors can look to for profits.\n\nTake advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off!

It’s transforming the way businesses operate, reshaping everything from data crunching and decision-making to customer service and content generation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen we look ahead, we see that Cadence’s contribution to chip design gives the company a strong foundation from which to grow. Hyperscale AI and cloud providers – think Amazon, Google, and Microsoft – have a definite need for custom chips that are designed to handle high volumes at lower cost, and Cadence is well-placed to fill that niche.\n\nTurning to Cadence’s financial performance, we find that in 1Q25, at the bottom line, the non-GAAP EPS of $1.57 was up 40 cents per share from 1Q24 and was 7 cents higher than the forecast. Revenue, at $1.24 billion, was up 23% year-over-year and met Street expectations. Cadence finished Q1 with a work backlog of $6.4 billion.\n\nFor Goldman’s Schneider, the key points here are the quality of Cadence’s business and the high potential of the company to continue growing. He says of this AI-adjacent tech firm, “We see Cadence as one of the most high-quality compounding businesses in our coverage, with exposure to multiple drivers of growth throughout the industry. We see long-term growth driven by the diffusion of custom chip design across a broader range of customers with an outsized need for IP…”\n\nBased on this stance, Schneider rates CDNS as a Buy, which he complements with a $380 price target that suggests a one-year upside potential to the stock of 19.5%. (To watch Schneider’s track record, click here)\n\nCadence has a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 15 recent reviews which break down 14 to 1 in favor of Buy over Hold. The shares are priced at $318.04 and their $338.64 average price target implies a 6.5% gain for the next 12 months. (See CDNS stock forecast)\n\nBroadcom, Inc. (AVGO)\n\nNext up is a company more directly tied to the field of AI chips. Broadcom is a giant of the chip industry; with its market cap of $1.30 trillion, it’s the second-largest chip maker on the global scene – and the eighth-largest publicly traded company on Wall Street.\n\nWhile Broadcom’s business has been built on a wide variety of products and product lines, from cable modems to fiber optics to wireless connectivity, the company’s current strengths include AI-capable chips and application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. These are a key technology in the AI field and also underlie the functioning of cloud-based systems. ASICs are custom-made to the buyer’s/user’s specifications, which makes them more efficient in terms of power consumption and processing speed. In AI, cloud, and data center applications, these are vital advantages.\n\nBroadcom is known as a solid provider of silicon chips and other technology in the data center world, able to provide, at any scale, the hardware needed to build out high-performance server stacks and to develop and maintain high-speed connectivity. The company is also working on the next generation of AI-capable technologies, from connectivity solutions to custom accelerators, that will revolutionize the AI industry in ways that are still just in the outline stage. Broadcom’s development work is part of a coherent strategy that will keep the company relevant as a technology supplier as the AI sector evolves.\n\nThe company’s current success, and its sheer scale, give it a sound foundation for continued leadership in the field. Broadcom’s leading position in data center switching, and its reputation for high-quality, high-speed networking, are both attractive to the AI industry’s hyperscalers, and the company can leverage its own scale to meet the needs of its largest customers.\n\nIn the recently reported fiscal 2Q25, Broadcom generated $15 billion in total revenue. This figure was up 20% from fiscal 2Q24, and it beat the forecast by $30 million. The company’s earnings came to $1.58 per share by non-GAAP measures, a penny better than had been estimated. Management attributed $4.4 billion of the quarterly revenue to AI, a subtotal that was up 46% year-over-year. The gain in AI revenue was supported by strong demand for AI networking.\n\nScale and profitability are valuable assets for any company, especially one targeting an industry experiencing the powerful growth that currently characterizes AI. This caught the attention of Goldman Sachs, and when we check in again with analyst Schneider, we find him upbeat on AVGO, writing, “We believe the company will leverage its leadership in enterprise networking silicon to drive outsized share in custom silicon for hyperscalers, with AI likely comprising over 40% of revenue by 2026. Broadcom also continues to generate steady, growing profitability in its infrastructure software business. We see the stock’s premium valuation as justified by the visibility provided by sole-sourcing at silicon accounts and the mission-critical nature of its software portfolio.”\n\nSchneider puts a Buy rating on AVGO, and his price target of $315 implies that the stock will gain 12% by this time next year.\n\nBroadcom has picked up 30 recent analyst reviews, and these have a lopsided split of 28 Buys to 2 Holds to support the Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares in AVGO are currently trading for $280.94, and their $300.96 average price target points toward a one-year gain of 7%.

The S&P 500 particularly had a remarkable journey this year.\n\nThe index has bounced back strongly after coming close to a bear market in April and has been hitting fresh highs over the past month. The recent S&P 500 rally is driven by renewed optimism surrounding rate cuts and massive investment in tech on the domestic front.\n\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Adobe Inc. ADBE, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Analog Devices, Inc. ADI and Arista Networks, Inc. ANET, which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nS&P 500 Hits New Record High\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 1.1% on Tuesday to end at 6,445.76 points, a new record closing high. This is the index’s seventh record close in less than a month. This was also the index’s 16th record close of the year.\n\nTuesday’s rally came after fresh data showed that inflation increased less than expected. The consumer price index rose 0.2% sequentially in July after increasing 0.3% in May, and missed analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.3%. Year over year, CPI rose 2.7% in July, also lower than the consensus estimate of a rise of 2.8%.\n\nCore CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.3% in July, in line with the consensus estimate. On a year-over-year basis, core CPI rose 3.1%, slightly higher than analysts’ expectations of a 3% rise.\n\nConcerns grew over the past few months that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could push up prices of goods, which could weigh on the economy. However, the CPI reading alleviated those fears to a great extent, raising hopes of a rate cut in September. This sent stocks on a rally, taking the S&P 500 higher.\n\nMarket participants are now pricing in a 94% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut in September, according to the CME’s FedWatch Tool. This was 85% before the release of the CPI report.\n\nInvestor Optimism Helping S&P 500\n\nThe S&P 500 has had a stellar year so far, marked by sharp ups and downs. After reaching a record high in February on hopes that Trump’s pro-business agenda would lift the market, the index nosedived in April.\n\nThe decline came after Trump, weeks into his presidency, announced extensive tariffs, sparking fears of a global trade war.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T14:38:52.400604+00:00"}
