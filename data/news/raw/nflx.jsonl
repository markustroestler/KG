The seven-year deal gives Paramount+ exclusive US streaming rights for UFC events starting in 2026, including 13 numbered events and 30 Fight Nights annually.\n\nNotably, the deal is a shift away from the traditional pay-per-view (PPV) model. TKO CEO Dana White has said the agreement aims to make it \"more affordable and accessible to view the greatest fights on a massive platform.\"\n\nKonik wrote that removing the PPV barriers could drive higher fan engagement and broader reach.

Hits like Sirens, Ginny & Georgia Season 3, The Eternaut, and films such as STRAW and Exterritorial also boosted total watch hours, underscoring Netflix’s consistent content pull.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix’s pipeline for the rest of 2025 and beyond is designed to sustain this momentum.

The joke refers to one of the pains of owning the groundbreaking Model T, widely considered the first automobile affordable to a wide swath of Americans. To start one, you needed to use a laborious hand crank.\n\nOn Monday, well over a century later, Ford promised a new “Model T moment” for electric vehicles (EVs). The company said it is investing $2 billion to build a new EV platform and manufacture an affordable EV truck — retailing at $30,000, thanks to the kind of efficient, simplified manufacturing at the heart of the Model T’s automotive revolution — that will roll out in 2027. If successful, the company believes it could transform EV adoption in America, no exhausting hand crank required.\n\nAn Electrified Blast from the Past\n\nFord has taken something of a backseat in its broader adoption of EVs, with the pricey F-150 Lightning and the electric Mustang as its two most prominent offerings. At Ford’s Louisville assembly plant on Monday, CEO Jim Farley said the exponential growth of Chinese companies like BYD and Geely through affordable EV options, and increasingly price–friendly EVs from US and European competitors, meant his company “needed a radical approach” to stake out its own territory. Ford’s money-losing EV business — which posted $2.2 billion in losses in the first half of 2025 — could no doubt use the jumpstart.\n\nThis “Model T” moment didn’t happen overnight. Farley last year tasked a secretive “skunkworks” team in Long Beach, California, with developing “a new generation” of affordable EVs, not unlike the secretive team founder Henry Ford set up to develop streamlined production of the Model T:\n\nThe $30,000 EV truck will be the first in a line of affordable battery-powered models that Ford said will take 40% less time to build and need 600 fewer workers than its hybrid-electric crossover SUV, the Escape, which is set to be discontinued after this year. Those efficiencies are thanks to the “skunkworks” team, led by former leading Tesla engineer Alan Clarke, with its new line of vehicles slated to be built at the Louisville plant, which will be converted to manufacture EVs with the $2 billion investment.\n\nFord said its new EV platform will vastly reduce the number of components needed in manufacturing: 20% fewer parts than a typical vehicle and 25% fewer fasteners, translating to fewer workstations in the plant and a 15% reduction in assembly time. The batteries for the new line of EVs will come from a new $3 billion factory in Michigan.\n\n“We believe the only way to really compete effectively with the Chinese over the globe on EVs is to go and really push ourselves to radically re-engineer and transform our engineering supply chain and manufacturing process,” Farley said. He boasted that the midsize EV pickup will cost less than a Tesla Model Y and have more room than a Toyota RAV4.\n\nWriters Room Challenge: The Model T, which was produced from 1908 to 1927, did a great deal for comedy beyond Buster Keaton, frequently playing for laughs in silent film-era staples by the likes of Laurel & Hardy and Charlie Chaplin. Maybe we’re in for a run of Ford EV truck-themed Netflix capers.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:44:40.991791+00:00"}

It’s the first (or, well, maybe second) significant move of Paramount’s new Ellison era.\n\nElbow Strike\n\nLive sports rights remain the lifeblood of media companies, and UFC’s time on the market provoked nothing short of a bloody cage match. Paramount’s final offer ultimately beat out fellow competitors Netflix, YouTube, Amazon and ESPN, according to a Bloomberg report over the weekend. The agreement, which runs from next year through 2032 and includes a payment schedule weighted more toward the back end of the deal, also trumps UFC’s current rights agreement with ESPN, valued at $550 million annually. After spending big on an NFL rights re-up, which even included giving up a 10% stake in itself to the league, ESPN appears to be paring back elsewhere; the Disney-owned company similarly backed out of renewing rights to Formula 1 Racing earlier this summer.\n\nFor Paramount, the deal could help transform its struggling streaming division. For UFC-owner TKO Group, it’s just the second blow in a recent one-two rights-sale punch:\n\nThe deal gives Paramount the rights to 30 “Fight Nights” per year, as well as 13 “marquee events.” All content will stream on Paramount+, with some being simulcast on CBS; Paramount+ accounts for just 2.2% of all streaming usage, according to a recent Nielsen report.\n\nThe deal puts an end to UFC’s pay-per-view era, while bringing it into the streaming age. WWE, TKO’s other fighting brand, just signed a five-year, $1.6 billion deal to stream marquee WWE events (such as WrestleMania) on ESPN’s forthcoming streaming service; WWE’s weekly show, RAW, began airing on Netflix in the US this year as part of a 10-year, $5 billion deal.\n\nWall Street had a mixed reaction to the mixed martial arts news: TKO’s stock soared more than 10%, while Paramount’s (now trading as $PSKY) fell 3.7%.\n\nIn a Corner: TKO may soon score a third leg in its ring-corner stool: boxing. Last month, a bipartisan group in the House of Representatives introduced legislation that would allow new ventures in the sport to launch outside of existing sanctioning bodies. (In news to us, boxing has been regulated by the US government since the organized crime-filled days of the 1950s.)

And it feels like that power then is firmly with these leagues.\n\n00:26 Speaker B\n\nYeah, the leagues have a lot of power at this time. They're content creators, right? And so anyone that owns content, owns IP, we always say content is king, right? And it's no different with these leagues that are creating this content and putting out there and striking really creative deals as well, um, to ensure that their property, their IP continues to be popular in perpetuity.\n\n01:03 Speaker A\n\nThat's a great way to think about it, right? They, that is their IP. If we look beyond sports, what's the next content category or experience that you think will create that sticky moment for consumers?\n\n01:20 Speaker B\n\nYeah, so it's interesting. 2026 should be a really big year for video games. We really believe that, um, you've got the e-sports Olympics in 2026, you have the, you know, a really prominent title expected to be released in 2026. And you know, video games just just helps the whole sector in general, right? They come up with original IP that is then marketed for, you know, TV and movies that you see being played out. You also see video games, um, utilizing a lot of their technology and infrastructure to help in in in film, special effects, TV, etc. So we see a really big year for video games in 2026 and our forecasts show that. We also see, don't sleep on live experiences either. Because I think live experiences are extremely important. Um, you'd have, you know, that's where a lot of money that's going for the 18 to 25 really sought after demographic, that's where they're spending their time and energy because it plays into the whole social media platform as well as well because now they can go do these live experiences and post it to social media for their friends, their followers, etc. And that's really attractive to them and really compelling to them. So I think live experiences are going to continue to be extremely popular. We have it, you know, the spend on live experiences still exceeds the spend on digital experiences and we expect it to continue.\n\n03:54 Speaker A\n\nAnd to that point, live nation earnings, they've been crushing and a big part of that is people are going and traveling to see a lot of concerts. So that's a great point. When we look ahead to MNA, it was a bit stagnant in the entertainment space. We saw a bit of activity. We finally got that Paramount Skydance deal going through. What are you watching for when it comes to upcoming deals? Do you expect the end of this year and into 2026 to be a lot more active than what we've seen?\n\n04:44 Speaker B\n\nI definitely do. There have been a lot of announced spins, separations, things like that. And I think when you look at the OTT streaming environment, it's really kind of happened in a bunch of different chapters. With the first chapter really being focused on, okay, we have, let's just throw money at content, throw money, get to get people and subscribers onto the platform. Then the second chapter was really, let's take a step back, focus on ROI, focus on really making sure that we've got a profitable business. And now I think you're going to look at chapter three, which is what you're seeing happening right now, real time, some of the things that you mentioned, which is, okay, what are some creative partnerships, joint ventures, MNA, where there's going to be some level of consolidation in the in the ecosystem? Because we've done studies ourselves where the average consumer doesn't want to pay for 10 subscription services. They want three to five subscription services. And so, you know, this allows them to consolidate, you know, take advantage of economies of scale, and that's what I think we're going to see in the next year. But then going out from there, I think then it's all about what other things can you bring to your platform? Video games, social media, user generated content, and that again will just apply just continue to apply that stickiness factor where people are willing to pay more and and limit the churn that you have on your on your platform.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:44:44.642405+00:00"}

Among the leaders in this field is NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, which has played a key role in driving both innovation and investor interest. So far in 2025, NVIDIA’s stock has climbed 38.6%.\n\nThe company’s success has prompted other major tech firms to ramp up their investments in generative AI. At the same time, the rising adoption of smart devices is boosting demand for advanced computing and machine learning capabilities.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:44:50.290828+00:00"}

Startups from OpenAI to Anthropic have raised tens of billions of dollars.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBut there’s a downside to the new technology that investors are increasingly taking note of: It threatens to upend industries much like the internet did before it. And investors have started placing bets on just where that disruption will occur next, ditching shares in companies some strategists expect will see falloffs in demand as AI applications become more widely adopted.\n\nAmong them are web-development firms like Wix.com Ltd., digital-image company Shutterstock Inc. and software maker Adobe Inc. The trio are part of a basket of 26 companies Bank of America strategists identified as most at risk from AI. The group has underperformed the S&P 500 Index by about 22 percentage points since mid-May after more or less keeping pace with the market since ChatGPT’s debut in late 2022.\n\n“The disruption is real,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the Futurum Group. “We thought it would happen over five years. It seems like it is going to happen over two. Service-based businesses with a high headcount, those are going to be really vulnerable, even if they have robust businesses from the last era of tech.”\n\nSo far, few companies have failed as a result of the proliferation of chatbots and so-called agents that can write software code, answer complex questions and produce photos and videos. But with tech giants like Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. pouring hundreds of billions into AI, investors have started to get more defensive.\n\nWix.com and Shutterstock are down at least 33% in 2025, compared with a 8.6% advance for the broad benchmark. Adobe has fallen 23% amid concerns clients will look to AI platforms that can generate images and videos, as Coca-Cola has already done with an AI-generated ad. ManpowerGroup Inc., whose staffing services could be hurt by rising automation, is down 30% this year, while peer Robert Half Inc. has shed more than half its value, dropping to its lowest in more than five years.\n\nThe souring sentiment among investors comes as AI is changing everything from the way people get information from the internet to how colleges function. Even companies at the vanguard of the technology’s development like Microsoft have been slashing jobs as productivity improves and to make way for more AI investments. To many tech-industry watchers, the time is nearing when AI becomes so pervasive that companies start going out of business.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:44:52.228922+00:00"}

There are official distinctions, like S&P 500 components versus those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but there are also more nuanced groupings, like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, etc.\n\nSometimes, investors will get a little whimsical and come up with catchy names to describe red-hot, winning stocks. The \"Nifty Fifty\" was a popular term for large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nJim Cramer used \"FANG\" to describe Facebook (now Meta Platforms (META 3.16%)), Amazon (AMZN 0.08%), Netflix (NFLX 0.55%), and Google (now Alphabet (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%)). It eventually expanded to \"FAANG\" to include Apple (AAPL 1.13%).\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the largest seven technology-focused companies: Nvidia (NVDA 0.58%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.44%), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (TSLA 0.53%).\n\nBut the Magnificent Seven has its problems, which is why I'm introducing the \"Ten Titans\" -- the Magnificent Seven plus Broadcom (AVGO 2.94%), Oracle (ORCL 0.27%), and Netflix.\n\nHere's why the Ten Titans is a better representation of top growth stocks than the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe Broadcom blunder\n\nThe biggest flaw of the Magnificent Seven is that it doesn't include Broadcom. It's up about 450% in the last three years, which has pole-vaulted its market cap well over $1 trillion.\n\nBased on market cap, it deserves to be included in the Magnificent Seven over Tesla. However, some folks may prefer the diversification that Tesla brings to the table with electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). And some may argue that it's redundant to include both Nvidia and Broadcom since they're both chip giants, but Broadcom has a much different business than Nvidia.\n\nNvidia generates the vast majority of its profits by selling graphics processing units and associated hardware and software to data centers. Like Nvidia, Broadcom makes AI chips, and AI is its fastest-growing segment, making up around 30% of total revenue in its latest quarter. But the bulk of Broadcom's business is not directly tied to AI.\n\nEnd markets include networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, infrastructure software, and more. In fact, Broadcom was considered a dividend-paying value stock before its recent boom -- similar to another high-yield semiconductor stalwart, Texas Instruments.\n\nAnother \"value\" stock turned growth stock\n\nNot long ago, Oracle was seen more as a mature tech stock with an entrenched legacy business and limited upside potential. Investors were more excited about hotter software stocks like Salesforce, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Palo Alto Networks. However, Oracle has completely transformed its business, integrating cloud infrastructure as a complement to its foothold in database software and enterprise applications.\n\nOracle has carved out a growing role in the cloud that is uniquely different from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle's hybrid and multicloud strategy integrates with the major cloud players, which allows customers to use Oracle's database advantages even if they're with another cloud provider.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers some advantages over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, including lower prices in some cases, more AI tools, and vertical integration with the company's other database services.\n\nSome drawbacks of OCI are that it has a smaller ecosystem with fewer preset tools for developers. However, Oracle is growing faster than the major players with a 27% year-over-year cloud revenue increase in its most recent quarter, including a 52% rise in cloud infrastructure revenue.\n\nLike Broadcom, Oracle is a great addition to the Ten Titans because it's a highly diversified company that's playing a growing role in AI.\n\nFAANG's anchor is a worthy addition to the Ten Titans\n\nNetflix was an integral part of FANG and FAANG, but it fell out of favor for a while as it underperformed the broad market. The streaming company is now worth around half a trillion dollars, which has catapulted it to the top 20 S&P 500 companies by market cap.\n\nNetflix has pulled back from its recent highs, but the stock has still crushed the S&P 500 year to date. A big reason for its rebound in recent years is its improved cost management and more purposeful spending.\n\nA major problem with the business in the past was the boom-and-bust nature of its earnings. The company would steadily grow subscribers, but it would overspend on content and have dry spells without major success.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix spent most of the 2010s being inconsistently profitable. But over the last five years, profits have skyrocketed and its operating margin continues to climb in lockstep with revenue.\n\nThe company has revolutionized entertainment and remains the gold standard in streaming, despite tons of new competition. A lot of that success comes down to its ability to balance the quantity and quality of content it produces.\n\nIt's time to add some all-stars to the team\n\nExpanding the Magnificent Seven to the Ten Titans corrects for the blatant error of Broadcom's omission and includes massively important growth stocks in Oracle and Netflix. Over the next three to five years, it wouldn't be surprising if all of the Titans were worth over $1 trillion due to their industry leadership and runways for growth.\n\nWith a combined weighting of 37.7% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans offer investors a useful way to track the top growth stocks that can really move the major indexes and keep tabs on prevailing themes that are driving the market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:44:54.132755+00:00"}

Pre-tax profits edged up to £63m.\n\nBosses said the increase had been driven by a rise in subscriber numbers as viewers continued to flock to the service.\n\nWhile the company no longer discloses this figure, recent numbers from Ofcom showed 17.4m UK households – or 59pc – pay for a Netflix account.\n\nThat makes it the most-subscribed service in the UK, accounting for nearly half of all streaming views last year.\n\nNetflix’s dominance and the success of hard-hitting dramas such as Adolescence – the four-part series that sparked a national conversation about young people – poses a direct threat to the BBC, which has for decades been the strongest force in UK television.\n\nWhile the BBC remains the most-watched service, accounting for 19pc of all viewing time, a further 300,000 households stopped paying the licence fee last year.\n\nOverall viewing of BBC videos rose slightly last year as increased demand for iPlayer offset a decline in its traditional broadcast service.\n\nHowever, the BBC is scrambling to reverse a decline in viewership among younger audiences, who are increasingly shunning the public service broadcaster in favour of streaming rivals.\n\nNetflix’s hits last year included Baby Reindeer, the controversial drama by comedian Richard Gadd about his stalker, which won six Emmy awards.

One month later, the stock had given back some of those record gains, dropping 13% by the end of July. You can call it profit-taking, or investor nerves, or just a price adjustment. Either way, I think it's high time to buy Netflix stock again.\n\nI'll admit that the stock isn't cheap. Even after July's price correction, Netflix trades at a lofty 49 times earnings. However, the company has earned every penny of that beefy stock price.\n\nRevenue rose 16% year over year in the second quarter. At the same time, the business grew more efficient, and operating margins increased from 27.2% to 24.1%. As a result, bottom-line earnings skyrocketed from $4.88 to $7.19 per diluted share -- a 47% jump. Free cash flow nearly doubled, and the company bought back more shares than it issued.\n\nIt would be one thing if this report were an outlier among several missed swings, but it wasn't. This is how Netflix runs its business nowadays, focusing on profitable growth instead of subscriber additions at any cost.\n\nAnd I don't see any game-changing missteps driving the stock lower in recent weeks. Again, you can call it profit-taking, or you can point to a shaky economy. But the company posted another analyst-stumping earnings report on July 17, and the stock price just kept sliding anyway.\n\nFair enough. Every stock has a fair value, and maybe Netflix investors took this one a little bit too high in the spring. This is a new era for Netflix's business plan that should be good for its investors in the long run. So despite the generous valuation ratios, Netflix stock just might never be this cheap again. It's time to buy Netflix.\n\nTime to bulk up on Costco\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Costco): Investors rarely get the chance to buy Costco stock at a compelling discount, which is why the retailer's July slump is worth a closer look. Shares are roughly flat so far in 2025, trailing the 9% spike in the S&P 500 through late July.\n\nSure, the warehouse giant's growth slowed recently. Comparable-store sales rose 6% in June, down from 8% gains in the past 10 months. But that boost still implies that Costco is seeing strong customer traffic in a competitive industry. Target's comps were negative in the most recent quarter, and Walmart reported a less than 3% uptick back in May.\n\nInvestors will get fresh details on Costco's expansion pace when the company reports July sales trends on Aug. 6. Watch for signs of stabilizing comps in that announcement.\n\nCostco's e-commerce growth has been stellar, too, which should help support higher profits over time. Sales on its website tilt toward expensive consumer discretionary purchases like furniture, jewelry, and electronics, so it's good news for margins when that segment outpaces the wider business. Digital sales are up 16% over the past 10 months, management said in early July. We'll get an update on that figure in early August, too.\n\nIt's true the stock isn't particularly cheap right now. Investors are paying 1.5 times sales for Costco compared to Walmart's valuation of 1.2 times revenue. Yet Costco's premium is down from nearly 2 times sales back in January. That represents a good deal for a company with a long track record of market share growth, stable, subscription-based profits, and excellent cash generation.\n\nIf you've been waiting for a better entry price on this attractive business, this could be the time to push Costco stock up to the top of your watch list.\n\nASML's long-term investment thesis has never been stronger\n\nDaniel Foelber (ASML): There's no sweeter sound to the ears of a long-term investor than when a top stock sells off for near-term factors. That's what's happening to Dutch photolithography semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML. And it's a phenomenal buying opportunity for investors this August.\n\nAt first glance, the semiconductor industry looks like it's on a tear, driven by epic gains in stars like Nvidia and Broadcom. But look closer, and there's a mini sell-off going on in much of the supporting cast.\n\nAnalog and embedded semiconductor supplier Texas Instruments sold off after reporting earnings. So did Arm Holdings, Qualcomm, and ASML. All four companies posted solid earnings, but guidance pointed to a near-term slowdown due to factors such as shifting supply-and-demand dynamics, trade policy, and geopolitical tensions.\n\nIt was a reminder that the semiconductor industry -- although chock-full of multidecade growth prospects -- is highly cyclical and prone to cooling off, even during an evolutionary period in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nASML stands out as my top pick from the sell-off in semiconductor stocks. The company has a virtual monopoly in systems for the printing (or scanning) stage of the semiconductor manufacturing process. This step involves printing circuit designs onto silicon wafers -- creating a highly complex, precise 3D structure. ASML has spent decades developing its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems.\n\nCompared to the older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems, EUV can reduce costs for ASML's customers (chip fabs) and help them fulfill more complex orders faster by using wavelengths that are 14 times shorter than DUV light, reducing the number of process steps. The shorter wavelength allows chipmakers to pack more transistors per chip, which boosts their capabilities.\n\nOn its latest earnings call, ASML said it could not confirm growth for next year due to an uncertain geopolitical climate and macro concerns. The company's supply chain is sensitive to tariffs, and it has major customers in Taiwan, South Korea, and China -- making it vulnerable to trade policy. So I would expect ASML's stock price to react to trade-related news. However, management confirmed the company's 2030 targets due to explosive demand for its higher-margin EUV machines.\n\nAll told, ASML stands out as a compelling investment opportunity for folks with at least a five-year time horizon. The stock price could do just about anything in the near term, but the company is at the top of its game. It's the most exciting time ever to invest in ASML, but the market is too caught up in what could happen next quarter, so it's missing the big picture.\n\nPlay it safe with this monster dividend stock\n\nNeha Chamaria (Enterprise Products Partners): With the S&P 500 trading at historically high valuations, the Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner recommends dividend and value plays for a defensive stance now. I'm all for defensive dividend stocks now, especially companies backing their yields with steadily growing cash flows and payout.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners is one such stock that belongs in your portfolio. Shares of the oil and gas pipeline company yield a hefty 7%, and management has increased the dividend for 27 consecutive years. That's not even the best part.\n\nEnterprise Products' cash flows have comfortably covered dividends over the years. In fiscal 2024, for example, it generated record distributable cash flow (DCF) of $7.8 billion, providing 1.7 times coverage of the dividends declared for the year. That DCF coverage makes Enterprise Products' dividends very safe.\n\nAs it is, Enterprise Products' dividend is highly bankable because of the recession-proof nature of its business. Midstream energy infrastructure companies provide services like storage, processing, and distribution under long-term contracts with little exposure to oil and gas prices. What's more, the bulk of these contracts also have inflation escalation clauses to mitigate the impact of inflation on cash flows.\n\nBut here's the biggest reason why this defensive dividend stock is a solid buy now. Enterprise Products is bringing projects worth nearly $6 billion online this year, so management expects free cash flows to \"take a step up\" in 2026 and 2027. Read that as bigger dividends -- the bigger the company's cash flows, the bigger the dividends it can pay to its shareholders.\n\nA great growth stock for nervous investors\n\nKeith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): I'll readily admit to being something of a \"nervous Nellie\" right now. The stock market is near all-time highs. The Buffett indicator (the ratio of total U.S. stock market capitalization to GDP) is above a level that Warren Buffett has referred to as \"playing with fire.\" I suspect that many are underestimating the negative impact on consumer spending and the U.S. economy that the full brunt of tariffs will have.\n\nBut I think that Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a great growth stock to buy in August for nervous investors like me. This biotech stock is cheap if you factor in its growth prospects. Vertex's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which uses analysts' five-year earnings growth projections, is a super-low 0.58, according to LSEG.\n\nThere are no worries about a consumer spending decline or economic downturn hurting Vertex's business. The company markets the only approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). These CF drugs generate more than 90% of Vertex's revenue.\n\nMy main reason for excitement about Vertex, though, is its new products and promising pipeline candidates.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Netflix's ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Netflix is:\n\n41% = US$10b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.41 in profit.\n\nView our latest analysis for Netflix\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Netflix's Earnings Growth And 41% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Netflix has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, Netflix's considerable five year net income growth of 22% was to be expected.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Netflix's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 32% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.\n\nNasdaqGS:NFLX Past Earnings Growth August 7th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Netflix's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:45:11.216121+00:00"}

It closed 2024 with 301.63 million global paid memberships, up 16% year-over-year. NFLX announced last April that it would stop disclosing subscriber growth each quarter starting with the first quarter of 2025, though it will publicize major milestones.\n\nNFLX rolled out a lower-cost, ad-supported subscription plan in the fall of 2022. Netflix has also successfully raised prices on its top-tier premium plans while remaining one of the best deals in streaming TV for ad-based plans compared to Disney and other rivals. And the company effectively cracked down on account sharing to help boost user growth.\n\nThat selloff seems like a lifetime ago. Netflix successfully addressed all of Wall Street’s worst fears and then some, helping the stock blow away all of the Magnificent 7 stocks outside of Nvidia during the past three years. More recently, NFLX has charged 95% higher in the last year, tripling the Zacks Tech sector.\n\nNetflix stock tumbled between November 2021 and July 2022 as Wall Street feared its growth days were numbered and that it wouldn’t be able to churn out huge profits like Apple and other mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nThis backdrop makes Netflix one of the best technology stocks to buy in the second half of 2025.\n\nInvestors sold the news after the streamer’s beat-and-raise second quarter earnings release on July 17, which confirmed Netflix’s robust growth outlook in a non-speculative and stable growth area of the economy that’s not reliant on the AI revolution.\n\nWall Street took profits on Netflix stock throughout July after its furious first-half rally that’s part of a 550% surge off its summer 2022 lows. Despite this charge, and its massive long-term outperformance, Netflix offers investors great value.\n\nNetflix easily outperformed the stock market and the Tech sector over the last several years, without the benefit of artificial intelligence euphoria. The streaming TV and technology giant is also far less exposed to potential tariff and trade war setbacks compared to many of its big tech peers.\n\nInvestors can buy Netflix, Inc. stock roughly 15% below its all-time highs and at some of its most oversold RSI levels over the past few years to start August.\n\nChicago, IL – August 5, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Netflix, Inc.

DRI and Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC .\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company effectively streamlined its operations, grew its user base, rolled out more content, and, most importantly, expanded its bottom line. Netflix has also improved its balance sheet, and its board authorized an additional $15 billion stock buyback program in early 2025.\n\nOn a macro level, Netflix doesn’t need to spend billions of dollars on data centers or other AI-focused growth efforts to thrive. On a speculative note, NFLX could be due for a stock split, with it trading at around $1,170 a share.\n\nNetflix’s Growth Plans Are Paying Off\n\nNetflix completely transformed Hollywood entertainment and television over the last 15-plus years, turning it into one of the biggest winners on Wall Street. The company remains near the top of the crowded streaming industry despite growing challenges from deep-pocketed rivals such as Apple and Amazon, and heavy investments from Disney and other traditional titans.\n\nNFLX’s successful expansion into big-budget blockbuster movies and TV and reality TV are helping it thrive as the U.S. and the world cut the cord for good. Live sports were the last hope for linear TV and the biggest market for television advertising.\n\nYet Disney is launching a full-scale direct-to-consumer streaming version of ESPN in the fall at a $29.99 per month price point. Netflix already made its way into live sports, landing deals with the NFL, WWE, boxing, and more. On top of that, it's rolling out more video game content to make it as close to a one-stop entertainment shop as possible.\n\nThere is growing speculation that Netflix will experiment with user-generated content to help compete against YouTube, which owns the largest share of TV viewing (12%), according to Nielsen, ahead of Disney, Paramount, NBC Universal, and Netflix.\n\nNFLX topped our Q2 earnings estimate on July 17 and provided upbeat guidance, with its FY26 consensus up over 5% since then. The company’s recently improving earnings outlook earns Netflix a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and extends its impressive run of upward earnings revisions.\n\nThe company confirmed last quarter its plans to “roughly double ads revenue in 2025.” Separately, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Netflix is aiming to double its annual revenue by 2030.\n\nIn the short run, NFLX is projected to increase its revenue by 16% in 2025 and 13% next year to reach nearly $51 billion, doubling its 2020 total.\n\nThe streaming company more than tripled its earnings between 2020 and 2024. Netflix is expected to grow its EPS by another 31% in 2025 and 23% in FY26, following 65% growth last year. The company is targeting a 29.5% operating margin for 2025, up from 26.8% last year.\n\nBuy Netflix Stock on the Dip for Great Value\n\nNetflix was one of the best-performing stocks of the 2010s, and it is up 260% since the start of 2020 to outpace Tech’s 150%. It soared 415% in the last three years and 550% from its 2022 lows, leaving all of the Magnificent 7 (outside of Nvidia) in the dust.\n\nDespite its roughly 15% drop from its June 30 peaks, NFLX is still up 30% in 2025 vs. Tech’s 9%. The pullback over the last month has it trading at some of its lowest RSI levels over the past five years, down from some of its highest.\n\nThe stock is trying to hold its ground near its late April/early May breakout levels and its long-term 21-week moving average.\n\nAny drop to Netflix's 200-day would likely represent an even better buying opportunity. But playing the market timing game is no easy task.\n\nNetflix's pullback might not last much longer since it trades at more than a 90% discount to its 10-year highs and 31% below its 10-year median at 39X forward earnings.\n\nOn the price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio front, Netflix trades in line with Tech at 1.7 despite its massive outperformance and nearly 60% below its five-year highs. Disney's PEG ratio sits at 1.6, yet DIS stock climbed just 14% in the past 10 years.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nBadger Meter, Inc. stock tanked after its second quarter earnings release on July 22.\n\nWall Street is worried about the water management solutions firm’s slowing growth outlook and the negative impact of tariffs and other near-term headwinds.\n\nWhat’s Going On With BMI Stock?\n\nBadger Meter’s flow measurement, water quality, and control products serve water utilities, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers worldwide. The company’s high-tech smart water metering solutions empower its customers to optimize the delivery and use of water to maximize revenue and reduce waste.\n\nBadger Meter’s offerings aren’t flashy. But its essential water-focused tech is growing in popularity as the U.S. and countries around the world spend heavily on water preservation at every level.\n\nBadger Meter posted rather steady revenue growth over the last 25 years, including 18% average sales growth between 2021 and 2024. Despite this tough to compete against stretch for the water technology firm, BMI is projected to grow its sales by another 11% in 2025 and 8% next year.\n\nAlong with its strong sales growth came an earnings boom, including 35% expansion in 2024 and 38% in 2023. But its earnings revisions are trending in the wrong direction in 2025, with its outlook fading again following its downbeat Q2 release that saw its EPS expand by just 4%.\n\nBMI pointed to “certain tariff-related cost pressures” as part of the reasons for its disappointing guidance. Wall Street also wasn’t pleased to see that “total Selling, Engineering and Administration (SEA) expenses increased year-over-year by $9.1 million to $52.9 million, due primarily to the addition of SmartCover.” Its operating profit margins slipped from 19.2% in the year-ago period to 18.8% in Q2.\n\nBadger Meter’s FY26 earnings estimate is down over 5% since its Q2 release, with its Q3 outlook 8% lower. The downbeat EPS revisions trend earns the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now.\n\nBMI stock is up 190% in the last five years to outpace its sector’s 110%, and it blew away the S&P 500 over the last 15 years.\n\nSome investors might be tempted to buy the dip here. Yet it could be wise to wait for Badger Meter to prove its earnings revisions are ready to start trending in the right direction.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nMcDonald's Ahead of Q2 Earnings: Buy Now or Wait for Results?\n\nMcDonald's Corp. is slated to release second-quarter 2025 results on Aug. 6, before the opening bell.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%. MCD surpassed earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, missed once and met once. The average miss over this period is 0.2%, as shown in the chart below.\n\nTrend in Estimate Revision\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) has increased to $3.15 from $3.14 in the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a 6.1% increase from the year-ago EPS of $2.97. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $6.71 billion, indicating 3.5% year-over-year growth.\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for McDonald's this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\n\nEarnings ESP: McDonald's has an Earnings ESP of +0.43%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors Influencing Q2 Performance\n\nMcDonald’s top-line performance in second-quarter 2025 is likely to have been driven by continued momentum in global comparable sales growth, supported by consistent customer traffic, menu innovation and digital engagement. The company’s strategic focus on core menu items such as burgers, chicken and coffee is likely to have resonated well with consumers, particularly in a value-conscious environment.\n\nTailored marketing efforts, like the successful \"As Featured In\" meal campaigns and partnerships with global celebrities, likely attracted both loyal and new customers. International markets, especially those in Europe, probably contributed meaningfully to top-line gains as consumer confidence improved and McDonald’s value-focused positioning held strong against inflationary pressures.\n\nDigital and delivery channels likely played a critical role in driving incremental sales. McDonald’s has continued to leverage its digital ecosystem, including its loyalty program, mobile app and delivery services, to strengthen customer frequency and order value. With more customers shifting to online and mobile ordering, the brand is likely to have witnessed increased average check sizes and better conversion rates. Altogether, these factors are likely to have helped offset macroeconomic headwinds and kept revenue growth on a solid footing.\n\nOn the bottom-line front, McDonald’s is likely to have been driven by operational efficiency initiatives and margin improvement strategies. The company’s ongoing focus on simplifying restaurant operations, optimizing supply-chain processes and modernizing store formats likely contributed to better cost control and productivity. Its asset-light franchised model continued to provide a buffer against rising input and labor costs, helping stabilize restaurant margins. Additionally, pricing actions taken earlier in the year were likely effective in protecting profitability without significantly impacting traffic.\n\nHowever, continued macroeconomic uncertainties in some key international markets are likely to have affected consumer discretionary spending. Inflationary pressures, particularly in labor and commodities, are anticipated to have weighed on margins despite pricing efforts.\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nIn the past year, the company has gained 12.8% compared with the Restaurant industry’s growth of 8.7%. The stock has also underperformed the S&P 500’s rally of 20.8%. Other industry players like Darden Restaurants, Inc. and Yum China Holdings, Inc. have gained 44.4% and 56.7%, respectively.\n\nLet us assess the value MCD offers to investors at its current levels.\n\nFrom the valuation point of view, the stock is trading at a discount. MCD’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio stands at 23.56, lower than the industry’s ratio of 24.72.\n\nInvestment Thoughts\n\nGiven McDonald’s steady performance and resilient business model, existing investors may choose to hold on to the stock, but fresh buying should be approached with caution for now.\n\nWhile the company continues to benefit from strong digital growth, menu innovation and operational efficiencies, near-term upside may be limited amid macroeconomic headwinds and its recent underperformance relative to broader market indices. Waiting for clearer signals from the upcoming earnings report or a more attractive entry point may offer a better risk-reward balance for new investors.\n\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

(NFLX) stock roughly 15% below its all-time highs and at some of its most oversold RSI levels over the past few years to start August.\n\nNetflix easily outperformed the stock market and the Tech sector over the last several years, without the benefit of artificial intelligence euphoria. The streaming TV and technology giant is also far less exposed to potential tariff and trade war setbacks compared to many of its big tech peers.\n\nWall Street took profits on Netflix stock throughout July after its furious first-half rally that’s part of a 550% surge off its summer 2022 lows. Despite this charge, and its massive long-term outperformance, Netflix offers investors great value.\n\nInvestors sold the news after the streamer’s beat-and-raise second quarter earnings release on July 17, which confirmed Netflix’s robust growth outlook in a non-speculative and stable growth area of the economy that’s not reliant on the AI revolution.\n\nThis backdrop makes Netflix one of the best technology stocks to buy in the second half of 2025.\n\nIs Netflix the Best Non-AI Tech Stock to Buy Now?\n\nNetflix stock tumbled between November 2021 and July 2022 as Wall Street feared its growth days were numbered and that it wouldn’t be able to churn out huge profits like Apple and other mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nThat selloff seems like a lifetime ago. Netflix successfully addressed all of Wall Street’s worst fears and then some, helping the stock blow away all of the Magnificent 7 stocks outside of Nvidia during the past three years. More recently, NFLX has charged 95% higher in the last year, tripling the Zacks Tech sector.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNFLX rolled out a lower-cost, ad-supported subscription plan in the fall of 2022. Netflix has also successfully raised prices on its top-tier premium plans while remaining one of the best deals in streaming TV for ad-based plans compared to Disney and other rivals. And the company effectively cracked down on account sharing to help boost user growth.\n\nNetflix added 18.9 million paid subscriptions in Q4 2024, marking its largest quarter of net adds on record, topping the Covid-lockdown surge. It closed 2024 with 301.63 million global paid memberships, up 16% year-over-year. NFLX announced last April that it would stop disclosing subscriber growth each quarter starting with the first quarter of 2025, though it will publicize major milestones.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company effectively streamlined its operations, grew its user base, rolled out more content, and, most importantly, expanded its bottom line.

According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the streaming stock finished the month down 13%.\n\nAs you can see from the chart, the stock headed lower over much of July, even as the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.13%) finished with a 2.2% gain.\n\nNetflix takes a step back\n\nNetflix's pullback last month showcases what happens when a stock is priced to perfection. The stock was already falling heading into the second-quarter report, even though there was no major news out on the company.\n\nWhen it came time for its update, Netflix delivered strong numbers. Revenue rose 16% to $11.08 billion, narrowly topping expectations at $11.04 billion.\n\nNetflix no longer reports quarterly subscriber growth, but its growth was broad-based across all four of its regions, with currency-neutral revenue growth of 15% or better in each territory. On the bottom line, its operating margin jumped from 27.2% in the quarter a year ago to 34.1%, and it reported earnings per share of $7.19, up from $4.88 in the quarter a year ago and better than the consensus at $7.06.\n\nThe company also raised its guidance for the year, upping its revenue forecast from $43.5 billion-$44.5 billion to $44.8 billion-$45.8 billion and its operating margin from 29% to 29.5%. However, that was not enough to push the stock higher, as pressure from valuation and high expectations leading into the report seemed to have overcome the \"beat and raise\" results.\n\nIs Netflix a buy after the pullback?\n\nNetflix is now trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 50, which is expensive, even for a growth stock.\n\nHowever, its recent push into advertising is paying off, and its local content strategy is driving growth around the world. Its subscription model should also drive profit margins higher as its subscriber base continues to grow.\n\nIn the near future, valuation pressure could push the stock lower, but over the longer term, its leadership in streaming and broader growth tailwinds should make the stock a winner.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:45:27.172766+00:00"}

Through the first seven months of 2025, shares of this global entertainment giant have climbed 30%, continuing an impressive streak of market-thumping returns.\n\nThe top streaming stock is taking a breather, as it's down 13% from its peak (as of July 31). Some investors might be taking profits off the table after the company's incredible run. Are Netflix shares a buy, sell, or hold in 2025?\n\nNetflix's double-digit growth continues\n\nEven though macro uncertainty rules the economic narrative these days, Netflix remains in solid shape. Through the first six months of 2025, the company's revenue totaled $21.6 billion, representing a 14.2% jump from the same period last year. The leadership team raised guidance, as it now sees sales coming in between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion for the full year.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2024, Netflix had 302 million subscribers. Management stopped reporting quarterly subscriber numbers this year. However, new customers are still part of the story. \"Year-over-year revenue growth was primarily a function of more members, higher subscription pricing, and increased ad revenue,\" the Q2 2025 shareholder letter reads.\n\nLooking ahead, investors have reasons to be optimistic. \"We still got hundreds of millions of folks to sign up. And from a revenue perspective, we're about 6% of consumer spend and ad revenue in the countries we serve in the areas that we serve,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said during the Q1 2025 earnings call.\n\nGrowth will undoubtedly slow, but this commentary is encouraging. And according to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, revenue will increase at a compound annual rate of 13.1% between 2024 and 2027. It wouldn't be surprising to see Netflix keep posting double-digit revenue gains.\n\nGenerating robust profits\n\nIt has been remarkable watching Netflix's journey to dominating the streaming landscape. The business has certainly proved the skeptics wrong. These naysayers believed that Netflix would never be able to report consistent and growing profits, mainly because of how much money it was required to spend on content every year.\n\nNetflix kept growing, adding subscribers and revenue, and now has reached a massive scale that has bolstered its income statement. The company's operating margin went from 7.3% in 2014 to 26.7% in 2024. This highlights the benefit of having large, fixed costs at a time when sales have expanded rapidly. Netflix can maintain its powerful competitive position because it has so many subscribers who bring in revenue and allow the company to keep spending on content and marketing efforts.\n\nIn 2025, the leadership team expects Netflix to produce $8 billion to $8.5 billion in free cash flow. That would represent a 19.6% year-over-year increase (at the midpoint). This underscores just how lucrative the business model has become.\n\nHere's what investors should do\n\nNetflix has crushed the market in 2025. And in the past 12 months, the stock is up 86%. To be fair, the company is reporting phenomenal financial results that highlight just how much demand there is for the streaming platform. What's more, the profits aren't too shabby.\n\nBut I believe Netflix shares have gotten ahead of themselves. As of July 31, they trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 49.4. This multiple alone has soared 147% just in the past three years, as the market's optimism about the company has become strikingly clear.\n\nIn my view, the stock is overvalued today. Between now and 2030, I wouldn't be shocked to see the P/E ratio contract. I don't think investors should buy shares. In fact, the best thing might be to take some profits off the table. But if you remain bullish, consider holding.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:45:30.485625+00:00"}

During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has lost 8.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nNetflix is expected to post earnings of $6.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.8%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.4%. This estimate has changed +2.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $32.16 indicates a change of +23.4% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Netflix.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:45:32.333543+00:00"}

A few years back I thought that the rising streaming wars would take the wind out of Netflix's (NFLX 0.55%) sails. I could not have been more wrong. The stock has gained 33% year to date (at the time of writing), and outpaced the S&P 500 by 45% over the last five years.\n\nWhy was I wrong? Because the company has significantly improved its net income over the last few years, while creating strong forecasts for the coming quarters. It's done this through a blitz of content, and streamlining operations to improve the bottom line.\n\nNetflix hit a low point in 2022, when revenue dipped to 6.64% growth, and net income fell 12.2% year over year to $4.49 billion. Since then, things are coming back, and it's demonstrated in the share price.\n\nA good start to the year\n\nIn the first quarter, top-line growth was slightly slower than 2025, but the benefits of that growth were better. Netflix reported an operating margin of 31.7% versus a margin of 28.1% in 2024, while earnings were $6.61 per diluted share versus earnings of $5.28 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nYear-over-year growth improved in the second quarter, with a 15.9% increase in total revenue, and operating margin of 34.1% compared to 27.2% in Q2 2024. Earnings for the second quarter increased 47.3% to $7.19 due to a combination of increased net income, and a lower overall share count.\n\nThe second half sounds great\n\nLooking into the second half of the year, Netflix provided some upbeat forecasting. Third-quarter results are anticipated to be pretty strong relative to Q3 of 2024. Revenue is anticipated to grow by 17.3% year over year to $11.5 billion, while operating margin is expected to be 17.3% versus 15% the year prior. The real kicker is earnings, which are anticipated to increase 27.2% year over year to $6.87 per diluted share.\n\nIn all, Netflix has had solid free cash flow, and seems primed to keep going if its lineup for the second half of the year delivers for users.\n\nUpcoming content\n\nThe platform's lineup for the second half of the year kicked off with the highly anticipated (and irreverent) Happy Gilmore 2, and that's just the start. The company is slated to premiere many popular options including Wednesday season 2, Frankenstein, A House of Dynamite from Kathryn Bigelow, and the final season of the extremely popular Stranger Things. This is just to name a few of the upcoming pipeline that is a part of Netflix's continued strategy of attempting to create content for the broadest audience possible.\n\nAn example of this is partnering with channels overseas to provide content to a global audience. For example, the company noted in its second quarter shareholder letter that it had partnered with TF1, a popular broadcaster in France, to deliver its content to streamers.\n\nTo me, this is essential to outpacing competitors in this ever-popular space, and keep the stock as a good investment. I would argue that it's going to be virtually impossible to avoid the ever-expanding popularity of streaming, and Netflix seems to be holding onto the reins despite mounting pressure from a variety of competitors including Walt Disney, Paramount Global, and others.\n\nGiven Netflix's current trend of improving annual net income, I think it is a strong stock to own right now, even after already gaining 33% this year.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:45:36.503915+00:00"}

Although the streaming specialist faced some headwinds several years ago that caused its stock price to decline, the company has since recovered and is performing exceptionally well.\n\nNetflix's latest quarterly update was yet another smashing success. The bulls might rightly point to the company's strong results as a reason to buy the stock, or the company's dominance in the large and growing streaming industry.\n\nAll those are, indeed, solid arguments in favor of Netflix, but there is one that investors shouldn't overlook: Netflix's approach to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nThere is more than one way to leverage AI\n\nGenerative AI is a powerful technology. Although everyone is familiar with chatbots like ChatGPT, which are primarily geared toward answering queries and generating text, some applications can also be used to create pictures and even videos, doing so relatively quickly and at a low cost.\n\nPart of Netflix's strategy is to create content that its users will love watching. It could be tempting for a company in this position to utilize GenAI to produce inexpensive content. There have been similar strategies in other industries. Some companies have fired their employees, thinking that AI would replace them, only to hire many of these same workers back.\n\nNetflix's approach to using GenAI in its content creation will be a careful one, according to management. Consider what Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said about creators using GenAI during the company's second-quarter earnings call transcript: \"Our creators are already seeing the benefits in production through pre-visualization and shot planning work and, certainly, visual effects. It used to be that only big-budget projects would have access to advanced visual effects like de-aging.\"\n\nSo, GenAI is not fundamentally changing the way Netflix makes content. The company is utilizing it as a tool to help improve the process.\n\nThe approach could yield results in the long run\n\nHere's why the company's strategy in using AI is sound. The quality of Netflix's creations is central to its success. The company has made a living by producing shows that generate excitement, discussions, and debates, and spread through word of mouth. Eventually, these attract more subscribers to its platform, and the more subs it has, the more data it can analyze on viewer preferences to help guide its content production strategy.\n\nNow, thanks to AI, Netflix will be able to supercharge this strategy. The company isn't interested in cheap content. What it wants is better content.\n\nAI can make previously prohibitively expensive special effects more attainable, while also streamlining the pre-production and production process, thereby improving the quality of movies and shows made with the same budget.\n\nThat means more high-quality content, and, potentially, more engagement (in terms of viewing hours) and more subscribers. This could then lead to higher revenue from subscriptions and advertisements, as well as increased profits.\n\nAll that won't happen overnight. But if Netflix's approach to using AI in its content production works as intended, the company will meaningfully benefit over the long run. And there is at least one more way in which it plans on using AI.\n\nNetflix is currently testing ways for its users to search for movies and shows they enjoy by communicating directly with its interface in a natural, conversational tone, similar to how customers interact with virtual assistants. These initiatives aim to help users find content they enjoy more easily, ultimately increasing engagement.\n\nSome tech companies have achieved massive success in using AI-powered algorithms to drive increased engagement on their platforms. That could also happen to Netflix.\n\nNetflix is a great long-term bet\n\nNetflix is looking at a massive worldwide opportunity in streaming. It continues to wrestle viewing hours away from cable, but there is still plenty of whitespace left. In the U.S., one of the most penetrated streaming markets, streaming accounted for 46% of television viewing time in June.\n\nNetflix's growth has helped spur the industry, but the global landscape remains underpenetrated. That's a great reason to invest in Netflix's stock. The company's financial results, combined with its moat stemming from the network effect and a strong brand name, are additional solid arguments.\n\nHowever, investors shouldn't forget about the positive impact AI could have on Netflix's business. Netflix may not be a leader in AI, generating billions in revenue thanks to the technology, but the company's AI strategy looks promising and could significantly improve its business over the long run.\n\nNetflix would be a buy even if the market was not in the midst of an AI revolution. The fact that it is, and that Netflix plans to profit from AI advances, makes the stock even more attractive.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:45:38.117319+00:00"}

Investors raked in the spoils of its victory as Netflix stock climbed, hitting an all-time high a month ago and a market value of $570 billion.\n\nNow Netflix (NFLX) wants to be something else: Walt Disney (DIS). Or more specifically, an entertainment conglomerate like Walt Disney, but for a new generation. The company is spreading its wings into an array of entertainment areas. They include video games, live sports and other live programs like the talk show \"Everybody's Live with John Mulaney,\" and even in-person attractions.\n\nThe success of these ventures will play a big part in whether Netflix meets its ambitious growth goals and continues delivering fat gains for shareholders. The company aims to double revenue by 2030 and to hit a key milestone — a $1 trillion market cap, the Wall Street Journal reported this spring.\n\n\"What can go wrong?\" asked MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman, who is positive on Netflix stock.\n\n\"It's how the company continues to sustain the level of growth that they are at,\" he told Investor's Business Daily.\n\nHow Subscription Fatigue Affects Netflix Stock\n\nOne worry is that consumers are showing signs of subscription fatigue, which could impact Netflix's user base.\n\nMeanwhile, ad sales could become a bigger contributor to the streaming video leader. But lots of other big companies — Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube among them — are hustling to rake in more video advertising too.\n\nNetflix Subscriptions Hit Ceiling\n\nLos Gatos, Calif.-based Netflix dominates the subscription video-on-demand market with its deep library of binge-worthy television shows and topflight movies.\n\nNetflix reported a global subscriber base of 301.6 million at the end of 2024. It has extended its reach by adding a lower-price offering subsidized by advertising.\n\nBut attracting subscribers is no longer a major growth driver for Netflix. The company tried to fix the problem by cracking down on password sharing. The move helped drive a surge in new subscriptions, but that growth has hit a ceiling.\n\nIn a major move, the streaming giant stopped reporting subscriber numbers in its fourth-quarter 2024 report in April.\n\nWhat's New For Netflix Stock\n\nNetflix has begun urging stock investors to focus instead on revenue and operating margin. That's where its experiments with new growth initiatives could pay off.\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nNetflix recently unveiled plans to open theme park-like attractions in shopping malls that leverage its popular shows like \"Squid Game,\" \"Stranger Things\" and \"Wednesday.\"\n\nImagine playing a game of \"Red Light, Green Light\" straight out of \"Squid Game\" but without risking your life, of course. Or rescuing friends from the Demogorgon from \"Stranger Things.\" Those are the kinds of experiences Netflix has teased with its in-person attractions.\n\nThe Netflix House facilities will open in Philadelphia and Dallas at the end of 2025 and in Las Vegas in 2027, the company said.\n\nColin Dixon, an analyst with nScreenMedia, jokingly wondered if Netflix might one day offer ocean cruises like Disney. \"Maybe it's a little early to think about that,\" he told IBD.\n\nNetflix has also been cutting innovative content deals.\n\nIn June, the company signed a distribution agreement with France's largest commercial television company, TF1 Group. Netflix will stream TF1 channels and on-demand content on its platform to subscribers in France starting in summer 2026.\n\nSports is another focus. Netflix has ramped up live programming, such as its July 11 women's boxing event headlined by Katie Taylor's victory over Amanda Serrano.\n\nAnd looking ahead, it's got the Sept. 13 Canelo Alvarez-Terence Crawford boxing match and two Christmas Day NFL games for the second year in a row.\n\nA Disney Playbook For Netflix Stock\n\nAnother live venture was its May 31 in-person Netflix fan event at Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calif. Dubbed Netflix Tudum, the event promoted upcoming shows and movies. It featured celebrity appearances and musical performances.\n\nThe event actually borrowed a page from Disney's D23 fan conventions. That underlined what appears to be the tech giant's bid to transform itself into a Disney-like entertainment powerhouse. Netflix declined comment for this story.\n\nOf course, Disney and Netflix have different stories.\n\nDisney started out as an animation studio and moved into live-action features and theme parks.\n\nFrom there, it added broadcast and cable television through acquisitions of ABC and ESPN, video game studios, and other entertainment properties. More recently, Disney has taken on Netflix with streaming services Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nNetflix Market Cap Now\n\nNetflix began as a DVD-by-mail rental service at the height of the dot-com boom in 1997. When broadband internet to the home became available, the company pivoted and went on to dominate the world of streaming, outpacing Disney's growth.\n\nNetflix, which has dipped about 12% since hitting its record high on June 30, now has a market value of about $503 billion. Disney's market cap is near $215 billion.\n\nNetflix is growing faster than its old-school entertainment peer and doesn't intend to slow down. It set an internal goal of doubling its revenue by 2030 from $39 billion last year, the Wall Street Journal reported in April. Also by 2030, the company wants to triple its operating income from last year's $10 billion. If it can reach those targets, it could hit a market cap of $1 trillion, the report said.\n\nNetflix Advertising Model\n\nWith premium subscriptions slowing, the question is where Netflix will find new paths to growth.\n\n\"How could they get there? I think it probably would have to be driven by advertising,\" Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler told IBD, highlighting one oft-discussed path.\n\nNetflix recently added an ad-supported tier. Viewers who choose the ad plan pay $6.99 a month compared with $17.99 for an ad-free account. The move appears to be paying off, Kessler said.\n\nAntenna Insights, a leading provider of data and analytics for subscription media services, estimates that Netflix's lower-cost ad-supported plan accounted for roughly half of all new paid subscriptions between January and April 2025. That's an 11% jump compared to the same period last year.\n\nNetflix Stock: Betting On Ad Business\n\nAnd Netflix is just getting started, Kessler stressed.\n\n\"Netflix has been around for a long time,\" he said. \"This ad business has been around for a couple of years, essentially. I don't think there's any question that we're still in the early stages of them developing the offering and really perfecting how they go about monetizing.\"\n\nNetflix's ad business will drive the overall business over the next few years, Kessler predicted. EMarketer, an industry research firm, estimates that U.S. ad revenue alone for the streaming giant will top $2.15 billion this year.\n\nThe company is \"still in the process of launching a lot of the advertising tools that will enable marketers to get on the platform and reach the Netflix audience,\" Kessler said.\n\n\"But it's still early days,\" for Netflix ads, he added. \"Just the nature of the offering where you get essentially a subscription fee as well as related advertisement revenue. That's something that I think is very attractive from a business model perspective.\"\n\nAnalyst Estimates For Netflix Revenue\n\nMoffettNathanson's Fishman also pointed to the potential of Netflix's ad business. But he noted the challenges as well.\n\n\"Advertising is a completely different business for them,\" Fishman told IBD. \"But we have pretty high confidence that they will execute and deliver, even if there are some hiccups on the road.\"\n\nThat skepticism is shared by many on Wall Street. Analysts expect annual revenue to surge 87% to $72.8 billion by 2030, which would fall short of the company's internal sales target of about $80 billion.\n\nNetflix Stock: Leveraging Customer Data\n\nAs Netflix expands into new entertainment offerings, it can play to its strengths: its enormous scale and massive amounts of customer data.\n\nThe company can leverage those strengths to decide which content deals to strike. Netflix is expected to use the TF1 deal in France as a template, nScreenMedia's Dixon said.\n\nIn fact, in late July, Netflix forged a similar content bundling partnership with top Middle East broadcaster MBC Group.\n\nFind Today's Best Growth Stocks To Watch With IBD 50\n\n\"Netflix is now aggregating and selling other people's content,\" Dixon said. \"They're not licensing it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix can follow a path blazed by Amazon (AMZN) by using customer data to its advantage, Kessler said.\n\n\"Amazon has been around since the 1990s gathering data and information about its user base,\" he said. \"They're able to use that in the context of building an advertising business.\"\n\nThere's nothing stopping Netflix from following that playbook.\n\n\"You can envision a scenario where they start incorporating data and information they're able to more effectively target,\" Kessler said. \"Then they have the infrastructure to really allow advertisers to come on and buy advertising in a way similar to the way they do that in a variety of other contexts with other providers.\"\n\nNetflix Stock: Live Events Include NFL Games\n\nNetflix is also heavily investing in live events, especially sports, to boost its advertising sales.\n\n\"I know they're pursuing live versions or spins on some of their reality-type shows, (and) some of their competition-type shows,\" Kessler said. \"But I think live events are super important to how the company thinks about engagement and growth going forward.\"\n\nThe streamer's live sports debut came in November with a golf tournament featuring stars from its popular Formula One series.\n\nNetflix paid $150 million for the rights to broadcast two NFL games on Christmas Day and in January, and aired the first WWE Raw event as part of its $5 billion deal with the popular wrestling league. The company also is in talks with music streamer Spotify Technology (SPOT) to partner on projects like a live concert series and music awards shows, the Journal reported.\n\nNetflix User Experience\n\nKessler cited an important Netflix strength: the ability to offer a user experience that is considered the industry gold standard. And that's important since engagement is key to revenue growth.\n\nThis is also crucial given how the streaming market can be volatile, with subscribers frequently cycling through various services rather than sticking with one streamer for a long time.\n\nOffering the same gold standard in live events will be challenging. But on a July 17 conference call with analysts, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos reiterated that the company remains \"focused on ownable, big breakthrough events.\"\n\n\"Anything we chase in the event space or in the sports space has got to make economic sense as well,\" he said.\n\nNetflix is exploring adding video podcasts to its platform, Business Insider reported recently. In doing so, it would take on free TV behemoth YouTube, owned by Google parent Alphabet.\n\nWhere Netflix House Fits In\n\nOne initiative that will likely draw much attention will be Netflix's foray into in-person Disneylandesque attractions, like Netflix House.\n\nNetflix is simply looking to broaden its consumer touchpoints, Fishman said. Those attractions will feature \"story-driven experiences,\" games, theaters, themed dining and the obligatory gift shop.\n\n\"It's an early sign of more to come probably,\" he said. \"This is an early experimentation phase.\"\n\nNetflix is dabbling in other arenas as well. One is video games, a tough market where Disney has struggled.\n\n\"The games space is a difficult nut to crack,\" Dixon said. But Netflix will be trying something new with \"party and couch co-op games.\" Details are scarce, but the company sees its upcoming interactive games as a successor to family board-game night.\n\nHow This IBD Tool Simplifies Your Search For Top Growth Stocks\n\n\"Family game night is a great strategy because these will run inside of the Netflix app,\" Dixon said. Plus, the interactive games can be sponsored and stream ads, he said.\n\nThen there's children's programming. That's one area where Netflix and Disney are already butting heads.\n\nThe animated preschool series \"CoComelon\" will move from Netflix to Disney+ in 2027. Disney outbid Netflix for the rights to the popular program, according to news reports.\n\nBut Netflix will be getting Cookie Monster and friends at \"Sesame Street.\" Though it won't be an exclusive arrangement, the next season of \"Sesame Street\" will be available on Netflix later this year, while also airing on PBS stations and PBS Kids digital platforms.\n\nKeeping Netflix Customers Engaged\n\nIn the end, the success of Netflix's expansion push will rely on its ability to keep customers engaged and to outmaneuver rivals in an increasingly competitive entertainment and media landscape.\n\n\"Engagement is hugely important,\" Kessler said. \"If folks aren't using the product, the next step is maybe they're not going to continue to pay for the product.\"\n\nThe streaming video business will continue to be \"a dogfight,\" Kessler said. \"These are big companies with big budgets. … Netflix has a head start, (it) has a large user base and it has a massive content budget, as well as plans to spend in the future. So, they're well positioned, but it will remain super competitive.\"\n\nThe company's competitive position was underlined two weeks ago when it reported second-quarter results.\n\nNetflix posted only a modest beat on sales and earnings, which sent the shares falling. But it got upbeat reviews for what one analyst called an \"exceptional slate of content\" for the second half of 2025.\n\nIs Netflix A Good Stock To Buy Now?\n\nNetflix stock is up 33% year to date, through Wednesday's close. On April 21, the stock broke out of a double-bottom base with a buy point of 998.70, according to IBD MarketSurge charts. It hit an all-time high of 1,341.15 on June 30 before stalling.\n\nNetflix stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 91, meaning it's in the top 10% of stocks for performance over the past 12 months. Its IBD Composite Rating is a stellar 98 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.\n\nBut the time is not right to buy Netflix stock, according to smart growth stock investing principles and technical analysis. The stock has lost ground for five weeks in a row. On July 18, it fell below its 50-day moving average line, a negative sign.\n\nInvestors should wait for the stock to show signs of improving. They should look for it to pull up above the 50-day line again and form a sound base with a proper buy point.

Perhaps more important than the sales increase is that operating profit margins rose despite mega-spending on AI projects.\n\nMeta's quarterly scorecard:\n\nWins: The core advertising model is on fire. AI investments are clearly paying off. Zuckerberg is as engaged as ever.\n\nLosses: Super lofty guidance for 2026 capex spending.\n\nWhat analysts are saying:\n\n\"In addition to bringing tools for advertisers to better reach clients, AI can also be a source of currently unpriced revenue streams at WhatsApp (only a few regions use these messaging apps to engage with customers), including with Agentic AI. Also, with Meta AI (accessible from WhatsApp or via a standalone app in the US, for example), Meta could capture more search related traffic and open new ad opportunities. Were WhatsApp standalone to attract the same ad/services dollars as Facebook or Instagram, and assuming 10% cannibalisation rate, we calculate a $50 billion revenue opportunity in 2030.\" -HSBC's Neil Churchill", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:45:45.038673+00:00"}

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Netflix (NFLX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nNetflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.75, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.75 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 28 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.9% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NFLX\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NFLX\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Netflix here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Netflix, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:45:49.849555+00:00"}

While early versions of streaming emerged in the 1990s, momentum truly accelerated with YouTube’s launch in 2005 and Netflix’s entry into video-on-demand in 2007. As smartphones became ubiquitous and broadband access expanded, streaming has become the dominant way audiences consume media. Industry giants like Netflix NFLX, The Walt Disney Company DIS and Roku, Inc. ROKU are part of this revolution, emerging as must-watch stocks within the streaming sector.\n\n\n\nStreaming technology allows for instant access to video and audio content without downloads, providing a seamless experience across devices like smartphones, tablets and smart TVs. Consumers are drawn to the flexibility, fewer ads and binge-watching capabilities, prompting companies to pour billions into exclusive and original content amid the ongoing “content wars.” Innovation continues to propel the industry. Broader global internet access, mobile-first consumption and AI-driven personalization are enhancing user experience. Meanwhile, the growing popularity of smart TVs and gaming consoles has widened streaming's reach.\n\n\n\nAccording to research by Ampere Analysis, the global streaming market is projected to reach $190 billion annually by 2029 from 2 billion subscriptions. While Subscription Video-on-Demand remains dominant, Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV and hybrid models are gaining popularity. Live sports and interactive content are fueling engagement. For investors, the sector offers strong growth potential as companies pursue pricing power, ad-based models, strategic partnerships and global expansion.\n\n\n\nSo, if you want to join the bandwagon, our Streaming Content Thematic Screen could make it easy to identify high-potential stocks in this domain at any given time. Leveraging advanced tools, our thematic screens identify companies shaping the future, making it easier to capitalize on emerging trends.\n\n\n\nReady to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas? Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Screens and discover your next big opportunity.\n\n\n\nNetflix, originally a DVD rental service, revolutionized digital entertainment by launching its on-demand streaming platform in 2007. Leveraging its expansive content library and steadily expanding international reach, it evolved into a global streaming powerhouse and industry trailblazer.\n\n\n\nWith an estimated global audience exceeding 700 million when accounting for shared viewing, Netflix continues to solidify its dominance in digital entertainment. The platform maintains high engagement, averaging two hours of watch time per user daily, reflecting strong global product-market fit. Strategic partnerships with telecom giants are helping expand its international footprint, fueling subscriber growth and top-line momentum.\n\n\n\nNetflix aims to double its revenues and reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2030. The company’s growth strategy includes expanding its content library, advancing into live programming, scaling its gaming division and accelerating its advertising business. While live content remains a small share of total viewing, it creates significant value through high-impact moments that boost subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\n\n\nA key growth engine is the ad-supported tier, which has seen strong uptake — more than 55% of new subscribers in available markets opt for it. Management expects to generate $9 billion in annual ad revenues by 2030. Coupled with its investment in localized, high-quality original content across global markets, Netflix is poised to sustain robust growth. Its international strategy and content innovation continue to reinforce its leadership in a competitive streaming landscape.\n\n\n\nWith exclusive NFL and FIFA rights, plus unmatched success in weekly streaming charts through diverse, original content, Netflix’s expanding global subscriber base and accelerating ad business solidify its leadership and growth momentum. NFLX sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\n\n\nRoku holds the leading position in TV streaming by hours watched across the United States, Canada and Mexico. Originally launched in 2008 as a maker of streaming devices, the company has evolved into a full-fledged streaming ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThe company is seeing solid growth in the number of streaming households, fueled by demand for its stand-alone streaming devices, partnerships with TV brands like TCL, JVC, Sharp and other major TV makers who license the Roku OS to manufacture and sell Roku TV models, and licensing of the Roku OS to certain service operators.\n\n\n\nRoku is also benefiting from strong advertising growth, driven by a surge in monetized video ad impressions linked to the increasing popularity of The Roku Channel. This momentum is reinforced by a steady migration of traditional TV advertisers to streaming and ongoing investments in its OneView ad platform and overall advertising technology ecosystem. ROKU sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\n\n\nRoku continues to demonstrate strong platform fundamentals with robust user engagement, innovative Home Screen monetization and expanding partnerships across the advertising and streaming ecosystem. Roku's Home Screen, accessed daily by 125 million U.S. users, serves as a powerful tool to boost engagement and subscription growth. The platform’s AI-powered content discovery, personalized features and growing library of Roku Originals are enhancing the user experience and driving viewership. Collaborations with brands like Apple validate its influence in the streaming ecosystem.\n\n\n\nDisney entered the streaming arena in 2019 with the debut of Disney+, quickly amassing a substantial subscriber base. Today, the company runs three flagship streaming services — Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu — each tailored to serve different audience demographics and content preferences.\n\n\n\nDisney+ showcases content from its extensive entertainment library, ESPN+ focuses on live sports, while Hulu offers a blend of original series and licensed content. Together, these platforms serve as long-term growth drivers, reflecting Disney’s strategic shift from chasing subscriber numbers to building a more profitable streaming business. Disney+ has a rich and varied content portfolio. The platform offers a vast collection of films and TV shows from some of the world’s most popular entertainment brands, including Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, National Geographic and exclusive Disney+ originals.\n\n\n\nDisney's partnership with ITV in the United Kingdom highlights its creative cross-platform approach aimed at boosting subscriber value and broadening its audience base. The ESPN streaming service launch in Fall 2025 marks a significant revenue opportunity, unlocking a fresh income stream from Disney’s most profitable content.\n\n\n\nCombined with strategic partnerships like the Disney-Amazon AMZN advertising integration and Disney-ITV content sharing initiative, the company has created sophisticated monetization capabilities that significantly enhance revenue per user. Disney's bundle strategy continues driving higher retention rates while expanding international reach. DIS currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\n\n\nProfitable streaming is enabling Disney to reinvest in high-impact content, boosting not only engagement but also theatrical, merchandise and park revenues. With improved platform performance, bundling strategies and international expansion, Disney is transitioning from scale-building to long-term profitability.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:45:51.766369+00:00"}

Netflix’s strong content performance across global markets, including hits like Exterritorial (89M views) and Tyler Perry's STRAW (109M views), drove member growth that exceeded forecasts in the second quarter of 2025.

But it's important to gain a deeper understanding.\n\nHere are three things you need to know about Netflix before you buy this top streaming stock.\n\nBenefits of scale\n\nNetflix leveraged its first-mover advantage to rapidly grow its membership base in the early days of streaming, when the company was really only competing with traditional cable TV. Nowadays, Netflix is a scaled-up operator, generating $11.1 billion in revenue in the second quarter, and including more than 300 million households in its member base.\n\nInvesting in content and technology are huge fixed costs. This is why scale matters. Companies need to increase their revenue enough to become profitable on a consistent basis. Smaller peers have struggled with this.\n\nHere's where Netflix truly shines. It spends massive amounts on content -- $18 billion in cash is planned for this year -- while still producing significant earnings. Operating margin is expected to be 29.5% in 2025. And the leadership team believes free cash flow will total $8 billion to $8.5 billion.\n\nSuccessful strategic pivots\n\nIt's interesting to see how companies change over time, adapting to the shifting landscape in an effort to continue expanding. Netflix has made some smart moves, particularly in the past few years.\n\nIn November 2022, it introduced a cheaper ad-based tier, following what competitors were doing. This targeted a wider audience, particularly consumers who were price-sensitive. This offering is seeing robust demand.\n\nIn May 2023, management cracked down on households that were sharing passwords. Rivals Disney+ and HBO Max (a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery) made similar decisions after Netflix.\n\nAnd perhaps most notable is the company's foray into live events and live sports, a move co-founder and former CEO Reed Hastings previously said Netflix wouldn't make. The business prioritizes the economics of deals, though, ensuring they make sense from a financial perspective.\n\n\"We remain focused on ownable big breakthrough events,\" co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on the Q2 2025 earnings call. \"Our audiences really love them.\" Netflix owns the rights to Christmas Day NFL games, and will air the next two FIFA Women's World Cups in the U.S.\n\nNetflix's success at adapting over the years should encourage investors to give the management team the benefit of the doubt. Looking ahead, it's almost a certainty that the company will continue to tweak its business model to drive further growth.\n\nNetflix's big opportunity\n\nNetflix is already a winner in the streaming wars. However, there's still a sizable runway to keep the growth going. \"We also think that we are a minority of our addressable market,\" co-CEO Greg Peters said on the Q1 2025 earnings call.\n\nOf course, bringing on the next 100 million customers will be more challenging than it was to sign up the last 100 million -- otherwise, these people would already be subscribers. And because the biggest gains are likely to come from international markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, and Latin America (regions where people typically have lower incomes), Netflix won't be able to flex the pricing power that has worked so well in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nWall Street analysts believe Netflix's revenue will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13.1% from 2024 to 2027. Over the very long term, I expect these gains to moderate into the single digits.\n\nIf you're thinking of buying Netflix stock, you're now familiar with its scale advantage, the evolution of its business model, and the opportunity ahead.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:46:03.273832+00:00"}

You framed it as open versus closed, right? Sort of a gatekeeper-led company like a Netflix versus something like YouTube, which is creator-led. And how do you think that's going to play out? And is that indeed the better place for investors to be on those sort of more open systems?\n\n00:46 Speaker B\n\nYeah, it's, it's really strange because, you know, the internet has been around for what? 30 years? Smartphones have been around for 15. And suddenly in the last 18 months, we've just seen, no matter what rock we we turn over, just real signal that consumers have a strong preference for open platforms over closed. So it is YouTube versus Netflix, um, is one example. But it's also happening in the video game space. It's happening in the publishing space. I think that's, that's where you want to go. Why is it happening right now? I think there's a couple of vectors. I think AI is allowing the right content to be surfaced in these open platforms, uh, more successfully. That's capturing consumers' attention. Consumers' attention spans, I think, are shortening. And a lot of these short-form, uh, types of content are more, uh, amenable to open platforms relative to a one-hour TV show or a two, two-hour movie. Um, and so, those are two powerful vectors that I, that I just don't see changing. So I think open is preferred over closed. And the, and the real question, you know, frankly, is are we going to see companies change their strategy? That, that's what we haven't yet seen. I mean, we still have legacy media companies in a closed ecosystem battling it out to try and get viewership or ratings points or ad dollars. Um, but there's a whole parallel ecosystem happening where there seems to be a natural tailwind. And yet we haven't seen any traditional media company really lean into these open platforms that don't have a gatekeeper.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:46:09.068921+00:00"}

Founders possess a unique ability to build and nurture a company from inception, much like a parent raising a child. They bring deep passion, unwavering vision and relentless dedication to their ventures. Unlike traditional managers, founders are often more willing to take bold risks, pursue unconventional ideas, and prioritize innovation to achieve long-term success. As a result, their companies often mirror their personal values, ideals and ambitions, becoming authentic extensions of their original vision. Founder-run companies represent less than 5% of the S&P 500 index. But that does not make their contribution any less. Everyone is aware of the success stories of visionary founder-owners like Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, who have redefined industries, creating trillion-dollar companies that continue to thrive. Some of today’s prominent founder-run companies are NVIDIA Corporation, Amazon, Meta META, Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway and Netflix NFLX. Founder-led companies represent nearly 15% of the total index’s market capitalization, with technology companies taking the lead. As these companies are born out of a unique idea, they often involve technological innovation. These companies are built from scratch in a way that they can navigate challenges to stay sustainable over the long term. Initially, others may not relate to a founder’s belief, making it difficult to source funds for the project. The founder often ends up putting personal wealth and savings into such bootstrap companies. If successful, they attract angel investors or raise funds. But it's always the founder-owner whose stake and risk are the highest. Additionally, founder-owners often find it difficult to delegate responsibilities, triggered by doubts over whether others can match their dedication or grasp of the business. As a result, they frequently take on multiple senior roles and face challenges in identifying a suitable successor. However, excelling in every area is rarely realistic. This reluctance to hand over control can limit the introduction of professional expertise, potentially hindering the company’s ability to scale efficiently or adapt quickly to evolving market conditions. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that founder-led companies tend to perform better over time. Per a Harvard Business Review Study, founder-led companies had a market-adjusted return of 12% over three years against a return of negative 26% for companies that hired a professional CEO. Our Founder-Run Companies Screen further makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks. Currently, stocks like Netflix, Meta, DoorDash DASH and Robinhood Markets HOOD look appealing.

NFLX carries a Zacks Rank #1.\n\n\n\nThe company’s focus on streaming regional content has been leading to international growth. Netflix is diversifying its content portfolio and working on projects across India, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and the entire Middle East. The company has launched low-priced mobile plans in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Moreover, the upcoming lower-priced ad tier is expected to further drive growth in these price-sensitive regions.\n\nNetflix’s 2025 priorities include improvement of its core business with more series and films to offer an enhanced product experience, growth of its ads business, and newer initiatives such as live programming and games. It believes these initiatives will help it sustain healthy growth.

Robinhood aims to grow many of these emerging businesses into $100 million-plus revenue contributors in the coming years, reinforcing its strategy of building a diversified and scalable financial ecosystem. Robinhood Markets is broadening its revenue streams through initiatives like Robinhood Gold, retirement products, crypto trading and growing interest income.\n\n\n\nRobinhood envisions becoming a global player and is thus expanding its presence beyond the Americas and Europe into the Asia-Pacific region. It sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\n\n\nDoorDash, with a market capitalization of $105.9 billion, aims to empower local economies by helping merchants better connect with consumers in their communities. Its primary offerings include the DoorDash Marketplace and the Wolt Marketplace and Commerce Platform. Tony Xu co-founded DoorDash with Andy Fang and Stanley Tang in 2013 and is the CEO of the company.\n\n\n\nWith a 56% market share, DoorDash is the largest food delivery platform in the United States. It also has a 60% market share in the convenience delivery category. To penetrate Europe, Asia and the Middle East, it is acquiring Deliveroo, while its SevenRooms will enhance merchant tech capabilities. DoorDash is benefiting from strong order growth and rising Marketplace GOV, along with enhanced logistics efficiency and a growing contribution from advertising. As its advertising now contributes meaningfully to margins, DoorDash inked an advanced partnership with The Trade Desk to enhance the platform’s ad targeting. By consistently improving its platform and incentivizing Dashers, DoorDash can meet the growing demand for on-demand deliveries.

It has been successful in making its own movies and shows, offering ads, and cracking down on password sharing -- all moves that may not have been all that convincing when they were first announced. And yet, the company continues to do well.\n\nThe company's dominance in the streaming business has propelled its stock to a valuation of over $500 billion. It has been a tremendous market-beating stock, and there's one stat that highlights just how truly special and impressive Netflix has been as a long-term investment in recent years.\n\nNetflix stock is on track for at least a 20% gain for the seventh time in the past nine years\n\nAs of Tuesday's close, shares of Netflix were up around 32% year to date. Unless the stock encounters some considerable headwinds later this year, odds are it will produce a return in excess of 20% yet again in 2025. And if that happens, that will be the seventh time it has done so in just nine years.\n\nThe lone exceptions were in 2021 and 2022, when concerns around inflation and interest rates were weighing on growth stocks. In 2021, Netflix rose in value but by just 11% as a late-year decline sent it into a tailspin, which continued into 2022, when it fell by more than 50% that year.\n\nAside from those blemishes, since 2017, the stock has routinely generated 20% gains or more annually. That's particularly impressive when you consider that the S&P 500's long-run average annual return is right around 10%. While the broad index has amassed returns totaling 185% since 2017, Netflix has blown past it with gains totaling more than 850%.\n\nThe company continues to impress with solid earnings numbers\n\nEarlier this month, Netflix reported its latest earnings numbers, which continued to look strong. It beat analyst expectations for the second quarter (which ended on June 30), as revenue of $11.08 billion came in higher than forecasts of $11.07 billion. And its earnings per share of $7.19 came in comfortably higher than what Wall Street was looking for -- $7.08. Overall, its sales grew by 16% year over year.\n\nThe company, did, however, warn that its margins will decline a bit in the latter half of the year as sales and marketing costs increase as the company releases more content. But that's a trend that has become the norm for the business in previous years and shouldn't necessarily raise alarms for investors.\n\nShould you buy Netflix stock today?\n\nNetflix has been a tremendous growth stock to own for several years now. Even with a massive decline in 2022, it has generated fantastic returns for investors who have held on. The streaming stock is undoubtedly expensive today, as it trades at 50 times trailing earnings, a steep premium.\n\nThere is some risk of a correction in the near term, but with the company offering consumers a wealth of content and being a top streaming business to invest in, it's still hard not to like Netflix as a long-term investment. It may be due for a slowdown at some point, and it won't always generate 20% returns, but if you're willing to hang on, you can still generate great returns from investing in the business over the long haul.\n\nAs a leader in the streaming industry, Netflix can be a good stock to buy and forget about.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:46:20.331520+00:00"}

Since investors have different goals, preferences, risk tolerances, and available capital, it's challenging to choose a stock that everyone would universally consider a smart buy. That said, among the many growth-oriented companies on the market right now, one which I feel looks particularly attractive is Netflix (NFLX 0.55%).\n\nThe streaming giant continues to deliver in a highly competitive entertainment industry, and the stock has excellent long-term prospects. Here's why investors would be wise to put $5,000 into Netflix today.\n\nAnother quarter with excellent results\n\nFor several quarters running, Netflix has been impressing Wall Street with its earnings results. The company's Q2 revenue increased 15.9% year over year to $11.1 billion, slightly ahead of its $11.0 billion guidance. Netflix's earnings per share (EPS) of $7.19 also beat its $7.03 projection, growing by 47% compared to the year-ago period. And there were plenty of other bright spots -- Netflix's free cash flow soared almost 87% year over year as well.\n\nOne thing driving these strong results was member growth. Netflix recently increased its prices in the U.S. and several other markets. Yet, new subscribers are still coming in. That says a lot about the company's business. Netflix is the leader in streaming, and its brand name and massive library of content continuously attract new users while retaining existing ones. That strong brand name also gives the business a competitive edge and pricing power.\n\nFor the third quarter, Netflix is guiding for year-over-year revenue and EPS growth of 17% and 27%, respectively. Management also increased its full-year revenue outlook to a range of $44.8 billion to $45.2 billion, in part due to stronger than expected member growth.\n\nWhy the future is bright for Netflix\n\nNetflix's brand isn't its only competitive advantage. The company's massive ecosystem of viewers grants it access to data it can use to produce new content (or license existing movies and shows) that its viewers will love. This leads to greater engagement as films spread through word of mouth and social media platforms, ultimately resulting in even more subscribers -- an excellent example of the network effect.\n\nSince 2019, the streaming landscape has undergone a significant evolution with numerous new platforms emerging, including some created by leading companies in the media and technology sectors. Netflix has continued to thrive despite all that, after an adjustment period. The company has introduced a low-price, ad-supported tier, for example, and it continues to scale its advertising business.\n\nEven with fears of an economic downturn swirling, the company's ability to grow its subscriber count while it raises prices suggests its customers aren't very price sensitive. If a recession does hit, that might somewhat impact demand for the company's services, but this wouldn't be the first time Netflix has navigated a tough macroeconomic environment. As the company's co-CEO, Greg Peters, stated during the Q2 earnings call, Netflix has been \"historically pretty resilient in tougher economic times.\" Expect the same moving forward.\n\nStreaming has already positioned itself as the future of entertainment. It is vastly superior to cable in that it offers the ability to watch shows or movies on demand on multiple screens at any time. That's why streaming has been gaining ground while cable is losing market share.\n\nBut old habits die hard. Millions of consumers are still tied to cable, helping to keep the industry alive in the U.S. That market will continue to shrink over time, though, and that remains a massive long-term opportunity for Netflix.\n\nAs for the stock, Netflix's forward price-to-earnings ratio is just under 45 as of this writing. That sits well above the average of 19.9 for the communication services sector.\n\nHowever, Netflix has earned the premium given its market leadership, outstanding track record, and attractive long-term prospects. Perhaps the stock may be somewhat volatile in the short term, but over the long term, this won't matter too much. Those intending to hold Netflix for the next five to 10 years should still consider buying the stock, even at current levels. Netflix is a top pick for a broad swath of investors, and with $5,000, you can get a bit more than four of the company's shares as of this writing.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:46:21.935713+00:00"}

Just this year (as of July 23), they are up 32%. With this type of stellar performance, it seems the business can do no wrong.\n\nHowever, there is one area Netflix has yet to tap: Theme parks. The company has become a dominant media and entertainment enterprise, but it's presence in the physical world is nonexistent.\n\nThis puts Netflix behind a peer like Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), which owns and operates seven of the 10 most visited theme parks on the face of the planet. Not to mention the cruise ships that Disney also has. Maybe Netflix is staring at an obvious opportunity here to grow its revenue and fan base.\n\nShould the top streaming stock become more like the House of Mouse? Here's how investors should view this situation from a strategic and financial perspective.\n\nCreating a flywheel\n\nDisney has unmatched intellectual property (IP), which helps support its flywheel. People might watch a new Marvel movie or series and immediately want to experience these characters in real life, so they visit Walt Disney World to ride the Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind roller coaster. They might also buy merchandise. It's a situation where all the pieces fortify Disney's competitive position, allowing it to develop deeper and longer-lasting connections with its fans.\n\nCreating physical experiences can help Netflix bolster its brand in the same way. For what it's worth, the company plans to launch Netflix Houses in Dallas and Philadelphia this year, and in Las Vegas in 2027. These are permanent, but small-format (about 100,000 square feet) setups located in shopping malls. There are interactive experiences, dining options, and retail stores.\n\nIt's encouraging to see Netflix test the waters when it comes to physical experiences. It might not have the breadth and depth of IP that Disney has, especially when it comes to content for kids and families, but it has extremely popular shows and movies that people love. It's probably best that Netflix isn't going full steam ahead with building an actual theme park, as it likely won't be able to compete with Disney's dominance, or with Comcast's Universal Studios.\n\nFinancial implications\n\nWhen making these kinds of strategic decisions, what matters most is the potential they can have for financial success. Disney's Experiences segment is its most profitable. In fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 28, 2024), this division raked in $9.3 billion in operating income on $34.2 billion in revenue.\n\nNetflix reported $6.9 billion in free cash flow in 2024, with a forecast to bring in between $8 billion and $8.5 billion this year. Investing in building out theme parks would require huge capital expenditure commitments that would certainly dent Netflix's strong financial position. Return on invested capital is a key metric that management teams should think about when allocating cash to its best use. Developing physical experiences at Disney's level would take resources away from creating top-notch content that the company is known for.\n\nIn September 2023, Disney announced that it was going to spend $60 billion over the next decade to expand its Experiences segment. That's a massive undertaking that Netflix can avoid.\n\nNetflix is doing just fine\n\nThe media industry, which is now being driven by the streaming model, is extremely competitive. There are many businesses vying for viewer attention, so it's always important to figure out ways of standing out. But Netflix reigns supreme, with more than 300 million subscribers worldwide. It's operating from a position of strength with the upcoming launch of Netflix Houses.\n\nNetflix doesn't need to be more like Disney. The former continues to fire on all cylinders. The opposite argument holds more weight, with Disney needing to be more like Netflix -- at least when it comes to the House of Mouse's streaming segment that just became profitable not too long ago.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:46:25.354306+00:00"}

In particular, solid earnings from blue-chip technology stocks that portrayed the growing clout of AI infrastructure spending induced positive investor sentiments. Moreover, renewed trade deals between the United States and its trading partners for a mutually beneficial tariff policy boosted the markets. Investors now await further clarity on the interest rate cuts with the Federal Reserve slated to meet next week.\n\n\n\nAmid the vagaries of the market, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks, like Netflix, Inc. NFLX, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD and Affirm Holdings, Inc. AFRM when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.\n\n\n\nThis approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. Momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.\n\n\n\nMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play. Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.\n\nScreening Parameters for Momentum Anomaly Stocks\n\nPercentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.\n\n\n\nPercentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.\n\n\n\nZacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\n\n\nMomentum Style Score of B or Better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors that include volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.\n\n\n\nCurrent Price greater than $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.\n\n\n\nMarket Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.\n\n\n\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.\n\n\n\nHere are three stocks out of the five that made it through this screen:\n\n\n\nLos Gatos, CA-based Netflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. The company has evolved from a small DVD-rental provider to a dominant streaming service provider, courtesy of its wide-ranging content portfolio and a fortified international footprint. Netflix streams movies, television shows and documentaries across a wide variety of genres and languages. Domestic and international subscribers can watch them on a host of Internet-connected devices, including television sets, computers and mobile devices. The stock has surged 86.2% in the past year but declined 7.3% in the past week. Netflix has a Momentum Score of A.\n\n\n\nHeadquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Robinhood Markets is a financial services company that offers trading services in crypto, stocks, options, exchange-traded funds, cash management, margin and securities lending and Robinhood Gold. The company aims to democratize finance through its commission-free trading model, which was launched in 2013, with no account minimums. The company serves in the United States, the United Kingdom and selected European Union (EU) jurisdictions through its apps and subsidiaries. The stock has rallied 381.3% in the past year but lost 3.3% in the past week. Robinhood Markets has a Momentum Score of A.\n\n\n\nHeadquartered in San Francisco, CA, Affirm is a financial technology firm specializing in payment solutions that provide consumers with flexible, transparent installment loans — both interest-free and interest-bearing — at the point of sale.

Around 83% of companies have exceeded analysts’ profit estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s on track for the highest share of beats since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 28% since hitting a low on April 8, setting a series of record highs over the past few weeks. Even a version of the US benchmark that weights all members equally, rather than by market value, has notched a record. Those advances have come as fears about the impact of tariffs on the economy ebbed and investors slowly returned to stocks, abandoning an extreme aversion to risk.\n\nFor the gains to persist, corporate earnings will need to keep impressing investors, and Mark Hackett at Nationwide says the earnings season is pointing in that direction.\n\n“As some of the pessimistic scenarios are fading, management commentary is less conservative and estimates for 2025 and 2026 are beginning to increase, which provides that tailwind,” said the firm’s chief market strategist.\n\nSeveral major companies have been upbeat. Alphabet Inc. saw demand for artificial intelligence products boosting quarterly sales. Homebuilders D.R. Horton Inc. and PulteGroup Inc. reported better-than-expected earnings, sparking a relief rally in the stocks. Netflix Inc. raised its forecast for full-year sales and profit margins. And Levi Strauss & Co. said it expected sales growth to outweigh the effect of tariffs.\n\nMost companies are topping estimates for a quarter where many analysts lowered their expectations, anticipating a weak reporting period amid heightened uncertainty about trade policy and economic growth. Before the cycle started, S&P 500 companies were expected to post a profit increase of 2.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, according to data compiled by BI. So far, overall earnings growth is 4.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, economic data is also showing no immediate cause for alarm.

Even better, a historically bullish trendline could soon help the shares move closer to their June 30, record high of $1,341.15.\n\nPer Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, NFLX's recent pullback placed it within one standard deviation of its 80-day moving average.

(NFLX) the Best Nancy Pelosi Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nmollie-sivaram-yubCnXAA3H8-unsplash\n\nNetflix (NFLX) is pursuing multiple growth levers to sustain its premium valuation, with its ad-supported tier and password-sharing crackdown serving as key drivers. The ad tier has surged to 94 million monthly active users by early 2025, doubling year over year, with U.S. users averaging 41 hours of monthly viewing. Ads deliver 8x better brand lift and 3x higher purchase intent than typical TV spots, benefiting from Netflix’s user data.\n\nA proprietary Ads Suite, launched in April in the U.S. and Canada, will integrate AI-powered overlays and dynamic placements by 2026, expected to double ad revenue in 2025 as the platform moves to first-party ad tech. Since its 2022 crackdown, Netflix has converted tens of millions of shared accounts into paying customers, adding ~55 million net new accounts through mid‑2024, with 16–17% annual subscriber growth.\n\nThis tailwind is slowing, and Netflix will stop reporting subscriber counts and ARPU after Q1 2025, shifting focus to revenue, free cash flow, and engagement. AI also underpins innovation in conversational search and ad customization, reinforcing Netflix’s technological edge. Content spend is set to rise 11% in 2025 to ~$18 billion, emphasizing fewer, higher-impact hits while nudging operating margins toward the low‑30% range.\n\nStrong free cash flow—$2.7 billion in Q1 2025 and ~$8 billion expected for the year—funds aggressive buybacks, with $13.6 billion authorization remaining. Q2 guidance calls for +15% revenue growth and +44% EPS growth, with ~33% margins; execution remains critical given the ~47x forward P/E. While upside is tempered, Netflix’s diversified growth, AI-enabled monetization, and disciplined spending underpin its long-term compounding story.\n\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) by Margin of Sanity in May 2025, which highlighted hidden value in its amortized content library supporting engagement and revenue. The company’s stock price has appreciated about 11.3% since our coverage, as growth levers gained traction. The thesis still stands. Swiss Transparent Portfolio shares a similar view but emphasizes ads, AI, and free cash flow.\n\nNetflix, Inc. is on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 150 hedge fund portfolios held NFLX at the end of the first quarter which was 144 in the previous quarter.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) is the world’s largest producer and distributor of video streaming content, measured by content spending and subscriber base. Shares rose following strong first quarter 2025 results, which reflected solid subscriber growth and retention, continued margin expansion, and increased capital returns, including a $3.5 billion share repurchase—the largest in the company’s history. Advertising momentum continued, bolstered by reports of a $9 billion internal ad revenue target by 2030.

The figure jumped 47.3% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues came in slightly above the company guidance at $11.07 billion, increasing 16% year over year, driven primarily by membership growth, higher subscription pricing and increased ad revenues. The figure missed the consensus mark by 0.06%.\n\nJPM has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.6% and 5.1%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 1.5% in the last seven days.\n\nJPMorgan Chase has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of -0.2% and -3.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% in the last seven days.\n\nManagement now projects NII to be approximately $95.5 billion following solid first-half performance and higher yields. Earlier, the company anticipated NII to reach almost $94.5 billion. JPM expects non-interest expenses of $95.5 billion. It emphasized the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in boosting efficiency and noted that its technology budget is $18 billion this year, up roughly 6% from last year.\n\nJPM’s business expansion initiatives, loan demand and relatively high interest rates should drive net interest income (NII) growth. While normal deal-making activity is tied to the health of the economy, JPMorgan's solid pipeline and leadership have generated continued growth in the investment banking business thus far.\n\nJPMorgan Chase came up with quarterly adjusted earnings of $4.96 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.51 per share. JPM posted revenues of $44.91 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $43.81 billion.\n\nEach of our picks currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating solid price upside in the near term.

Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are: JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, Netflix Inc. NFLX, The Progressive Corp. PGR, GE Aerospace GE and Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR.\n\nSome of these stocks have seen solid earnings estimate revisions for the second half of this year and next year after beating second-quarter estimates. This is significant as positive earnings estimate revisions indicate that market participants are expecting these companies to perform better in the rest of 2025.\n\nThe second-quarter 2025 earnings season is in full swing, with this week being the first big one this reporting cycle. So far, earnings results have come in better than expected. A few U.S. corporate bigwigs have already reported their quarterly financial numbers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe second-quarter content slate wrapped up on a high note as Squid Game S3 (122M views) became the company’s sixth biggest season of any series in just a few weeks of viewing. On April 1, NFLX launched its Ad Suite in the United States and ramped up this Ad Suite in international markets. The ad-supported offerings will enable management to witness impressive subscribers and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth.\n\nNFLX raised its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to $44.8-$45.2 billion from the previous range of $43.5-$44.5 billion. The increase in revenues stems from multiple growth drivers working in tandem. Member growth accelerated toward the end of the second quarter, exceeding internal forecasts, while NFLX’s advertising business continues gaining traction with expectations to roughly double ad revenues in 2025.\n\nFurthermore, Netflix uses AI, data science and machine language extensively to provide consumers with more appropriate and intuitive suggestions. Netflix's AI platform takes into account an individual’s viewing habits and hobbies and accordingly provides recommendations. AI applications enable NFLX to offer a high-quality streaming service at reduced bandwidths.\n\nNetflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.3% and 31.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.5% in the last seven days.\n\nNFLX has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12.8% and 23.4%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 3.3% in the last seven days.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Progressive Corp.\n\nThe Progressive continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio and strength in Personal auto, contributing about 75% of total premiums. Rate increases, personal auto application increases, improving retention rates and a strong independent agents' network should drive long-term premium growth and generate steady revenues.\n\nInvestment in digital transformation should support this strength. PGR has a reinsurance program to offset some of its losses and a strong financial position overall. PGR’s second-quarter 2025 earnings per share of $4.88 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.1%. The bottom line increased 84.1% year over year.\n\nPGR’s net premiums written were $20 billion in the quarter, up 12% from $17.9 billion a year ago. Net premiums earned grew 18% to $20.3 billion. The reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.1 billion.\n\nPGR’s operating revenues increased 19.5% year over year to $42.2 billion, driven by 19% higher net premiums earned, a 29.3% increase in net investment income, an 18.9% rise in fees and 28% higher service revenues. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 96.4%.\n\nThe Progressive has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 16.6% and 23.4%, respectively, for the current year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 1.2% in the last seven days.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGE Aerospace\n\nGE Aerospace has been witnessing strength in its businesses, driven by robust demand for commercial engines, propulsion and additive technologies. GE’s second-quarter adjusted earnings were $1.66 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43. The bottom line surged 38% year over year.\n\nTotal revenues were $11 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 21%. Total orders grew 27% on a year-over-year basis to $14.2 billion. GE’s adjusted revenues were $10.2 billion, marking a year-over-year increase of 23%. The metric beat the consensus estimate of $9.7 billion.\n\nRising U.S. & international defense budgets, geopolitical tensions, positive airline & airframer dynamics and robust demand for commercial air travel augur well for the company. GE’s portfolio-reshaping actions are likely to unlock values for its shareholders.\n\nFor 2025, GE expects adjusted revenues to grow in the mid-teens range from the year-ago period's actual. Operating profit is estimated to be in the band of $8.2-$8.5 billion. Adjusted earnings are predicted to be in the range of $5.60-$5.80 per share. Free cash flow is anticipated in the band of $6.5-$6.9 billion, with the conversion rate projected at more than 100%.\n\nGE Aerospace has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of -4.1% and 22.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% in the last seven days.\n\nGE has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.4% and 19.1%, respectively, for next year.

IBKR came up with quarterly adjusted earnings of $0.51 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.46 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.44 per share a year ago. IBKR posted quarterly revenues of $1.48 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.76%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.23 billion.\n\nIBKR’s efforts to develop proprietary software, lower compensation expenses relative to net revenues, enhance its emerging market customers and global footprint, along with relatively high rates, are expected to continue aiding revenues. IBKR’s initiatives to expand its product suite and the reach of its services will support financials.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.4% and 9.7%, respectively, for the current year.

Its business model introduced convenience by mailing DVDs to customers so they no longer had to visit a physical store. Blockbuster, which operated America's largest movie rental chain at the time, didn't see the value in Netflix's idea, because it turned down an opportunity to acquire the budding start-up for just $50 million in 2000.\n\nNetflix shifted its focus to streaming in 2007, which eliminated the need for discs and other hardware altogether. This created an existential crisis for rental chains like Blockbuster, which are now a distant memory for most consumers. Investors who bought Netflix stock at the time of its initial public offering (IPO) and kept the faith are now sitting on a whopping 112,700% return.\n\nThe company's valuation now stands at over half a trillion dollars -- talk about a missed opportunity for Blockbuster. But can the streaming giant still deliver upside for investors who buy it today?\n\nAdvertising and live events are key to Netflix's future growth\n\nNetflix has over 300 million paying subscribers, which is far more than Amazon Prime's estimated 200 million subscribers, and more than double the 126 million subscribers using Disney's Disney+. The larger Netflix becomes, the harder it is to generate growth, so the company is taking full advantage of its incredible scale to outspend its competitors in an effort to remain the most attractive platform in the industry.\n\nThe company is on track to invest $18 billion to create and license content this year alone, and live events are becoming more of a focus because they are big draw cards for new members. Netflix exclusively showed both Christmas Day NFL games last year, which each attracted more than 30 million viewers. This made them the most streamed matches in the sport's history, so they'll be back again in 2025.\n\nMoreover, following the success of the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match last November, Netflix doubled down on the sport this year. The platform livestreamed the Katie Taylor vs. Amanda Serrano bout on July 11, and it will show the Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford matchup in September.\n\nIn addition to attracting new members, live events also attract advertisers. Netflix now offers three subscription tiers: Premium ($24.99 per month), Standard ($17.99 per month), and Standard with ads ($7.99 per month). Ad-tier subscribers become more valuable over time because in addition to paying a monthly subscription fee, Netflix monetizes them through ads. The larger this user base becomes, the more money Netflix can charge businesses for ad slots.\n\nNetflix's advertising revenue doubled in 2024, and management expects it to double again in 2025. As of the last update (in the fourth quarter of 2024), the ad-supported tier accounted for 55% of all new sign-ups in countries where it's available, so it's creating a huge opportunity for Netflix to bring advertisers to the platform.\n\nNetflix's revenue growth is reaccelerating\n\nNetflix generated a record $11.1 billion in total revenue during the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30). It represented a 15.9% increase from the year-ago period, which was an acceleration from the company's first-quarter growth of 12.5%. According to management's guidance, revenue growth is likely to accelerate yet again to 17.3% in the upcoming third quarter (which ends on Sept. 30). This trend highlights the company's momentum, thanks in part to its booming advertising business.\n\nNetflix also delivered a record $3.1 billion in net income during the second quarter, which marked a whopping 45% jump from the year-ago period. It translated to $7.19 in earnings per share (EPS), comfortably above Wall Street's consensus estimate of $7.08.\n\nNetflix is one of the few profitable pure-play streaming providers, which is key because this cash flow fuels its content spending, which in turn attracts more members and keeps the flywheel spinning. Without its billions of dollars in quarterly net income, the company would have to rein in its formidable content engine, which could result in a loss of market share.\n\nNetflix stock isn't cheap right now, but long-term investors can still do well\n\nSince Netflix stock is up by a staggering 112,700% since its IPO, are you late to the party if you don't already own it? It certainly isn't cheap at the moment -- it's trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.5, which is twice what you'd pay for the S&P 500 right now (24.7). In other words, Netflix is far more expensive than the broader market.\n\nThe stock looks a little more reasonable if we value it based on its future potential earnings. Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Netflix will generate $30.87 in EPS in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of around 38.\n\nNo matter which way we look at it, investors who want to buy Netflix stock right now have to get comfortable paying a premium. Whether significant returns will follow might depend on an investor's time horizon. For example, an investor who is looking for big gains in the next 12 months might be left disappointed because of Netflix's valuation, but an investor willing to hold on to it for the next five years could do extremely well if the company's earnings continue to grow.\n\nA five-year time horizon will give Netflix's advertising business time to flourish, which could be a major tailwind for its stock price. In fact, according to an internal forecast, the company plans to double its total 2024 revenue of $39 billion by 2030, with $9 billion set to come from selling ads. If those targets are met, the next five years will probably be very rewarding for shareholders.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:47:01.598492+00:00"}

What's next for the stock?", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/23/netflixs-growth-is-staggering-but-are-shares-still/", "published_at": "2025-07-23T08:05:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Shares are soaring and business is booming. What's next for the stock?\n\nNetflix (NFLX 0.55%) stock has crushed the market this year. The streaming service specialist's shares have climbed more than 38% year to date as of this writing. This obliterates the S&P 500's return of over 7% during this same period. Such an upbeat market response isn't surprising. The company's recent growth is bolstered by a diversified set of powerful catalysts and significant operating margin expansion. Some key business drivers include member growth, a nascent advertising business, price increases, a ramp-up of live events, and a continued rollout of mobile games. With catalysts like this, the company looks unstoppable\n\nBut what about the stock? With fresh second-quarter numbers to examine, it's a great time to take a look at shares and evaluate them. Have investors already priced in all of these exciting growth initiatives? Or could the stock continue outperforming the market -- even from these elevated levels?\n\nGrowth is accelerating\n\nNetflix's growth initiatives are paying off, the company revealed in its second-quarter update last week. Revenue for the period rose 15.9% year over year. This was meaningfully faster than the 12.5% growth it posted in Q1. And, looking ahead, the company expects even more strong growth. Management guided for third-quarter revenue to rise 17.3% year over year.\n\nLooking beyond revenue growth, the company's earnings momentum is even more impressive. Second-quarter earnings per share came in at $7.19, up 47% year over year. This outsized growth is due to massive operating margin expansion. Second-quarter operating margin was 34.1%, up from 27.2% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nWhile Netflix's upbeat revenue outlook is helped by a weaker U.S. dollar, it's largely due to strength in the company's diversified set of growth drivers.\n\n\n\nWe're \"seeing strength in our underlying business,\" explained Netflix chief financial officer Spencer Adam Neumann in the company's second-quarter conference call. \"We've got healthy member growth, and that even picked up nicely at the end of Q2.\" He also noted that the company is benefiting from \"nice momentum in ad sales.\"\n\nThere's more where that came from\n\nWith such an impressive start to the year, management increased its outlook for full-year revenue. The company now expects total 2025 revenue to be between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion. This compares to a previous estimate of $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion.\n\nAdditionally, Netflix believes its operating leverage should persist. For the full year, management is guiding for an operating margin of 29.5%, up from 26.7% in the year-ago period. Notably, before the company's second-quarter results, the company was guiding for a full-year operating margin of 29%.\n\nWhile Netflix is benefiting from a number of catalysts, one worth calling out is its advertising sales. While Neumann emphasized that this is still a small business, he told investors in the company's earnings call that \"it's on pace to roughly double\" during the year. In addition, he said its ad sales are tracking slightly ahead of the expectations management had for them at the beginning of the year.\n\nNetflix stock: Buy, sell, or hold?\n\nWith Netflix's business growth appearing to be unstoppable for the time being, shares should trade at a high premium. Indeed, they do. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio is about 53 as of this writing.\n\nThe question, however, is whether this premium is too high? Unfortunately, investors who don't already own the stock may be better off sitting on the sidelines, waiting for a potential opportunity to buy the stock at a lower valuation. Of course, investors shouldn't expect Netflix to retreat to levels that appear cheap. However, a price-to-earnings ratio of 40 or lower would more accurately reflect some of the key risks.\n\nOne risk worth calling out is Netflix's well-capitalized competition. With several of the world's biggest tech companies ramping up their own streaming services, the battle for content is likely to only get more intense over time.\n\nWith shares trading at a valuation of more than 50 times earnings, it's fair to call the stock a hold.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:47:03.584648+00:00"}

The video streaming company has been a strong performer this year, with the stock up 38% year to date as of market close July 21 despite the pullback. As such, expectations were high going into the report.\n\nA huge market winner over the years, let's see if this pullback could be a buying opportunity, especially after the company raised its guidance.\n\nSolid growth and upbeat outlook\n\nNetflix said the key to its success is offering a wide array of quality series and films that resonate with its viewers. It noted that a hit show or film typically only accounts for about 1% of total viewing, so it looks for a continuous stream of quality content across regions and genres to keep viewers and bring in new ones.\n\nAs an international company, Netflix is also using a \"local for local\" content strategy to appeal and connect with audiences in their home countries. It said non-English content now makes up more than one-third of its viewing hours. Meanwhile, these shows can also become hits with American audiences, such as Squid Game from Korea, or Japan's Alice in Borderland.\n\nNetflix's investment in local content has been helping drive its results, as international revenue growth has been outpacing U.S. and Canadian growth. This continued in Q2.\n\nAsia-Pacific growth led the way, with revenue climbing 24% to $1.3 billion, while EMEA (Europe, Middle East, & Africa) revenue jumped 18% to $3.5 billion. Latin American revenue rose 9% to $1.3 billion, but was up 23% in local currencies. U.S. and Canada revenue, meanwhile, grew 15% to $4.9 billion.\n\nNetflix's overall revenue rose 16% to $11.08 billion, which was just ahead of the $11.07 billion analyst consensus, as compiled by LSEG. Earnings per share (EPS) soared 47% to $7.19, surpassing the $7.08 analyst consensus.\n\nMost of Netflix's revenue growth currently appears to be coming from price increases and membership additions. However, growing its ad business is a priority. Its ad revenue is expected to double this year, and it recently rolled out its new adtech platform to all of its ad markets.\n\nThe company also continues to expand its live programming, including boxing matches and two scheduled NFL games on Christmas. It also has weekly live programming through its broadcast of WWE's Monday Night Raw.\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix guided for Q3 revenue to climb 17% with a 31% operating margin. It said its second-half operating margin will be lower than the first half due to higher content amortization and sales and marketing costs related to its larger second-half content slate.\n\nFor the full year, it raised it revenue guidance, taking it to a range of $44.8 billion to $45.2 billion, up from a prior outlook of between $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion. It also increased its operating margin outlook from 29% to 30%. Currency rates are responsible for about half the operating margin increase.\n\nShould investors buy the pullback?\n\nNetflix stock had a strong year leading up to earnings, so expectations were high. The company turned in solid results and boosted its outlook, although that was not enough for investors to continue to push the stock higher. The stock is down about 1.6% after the report.\n\nThat said, nothing has fundamentally changed with Netflix's story. The company is still benefiting from price increases, while its membership numbers continue to grow, especially in international markets. Meanwhile, advertising should become the company's largest growth driver over time when its ad-tiered plans and live content gain more scale.\n\nHowever, with the stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 47 times analyst estimates for 2025, even after the pullback, I would not be a buyer at current levels. I think the stock has solid potential over the long term, but I'd still want a cheaper valuation before I hop on board.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:47:10.486872+00:00"}

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Netflix basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Netflix, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, to which Netflix belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Netflix is expected to post earnings of $6.89 per share, indicating a change of +27.6% from the year-ago quarter.

It also cracked down on password-sharing and experimented with live events, like sports.\n\nAs a result, the stock has skyrocketed, gaining more than 500% over the last three years as the chart below shows.\n\nNetflix isn't going to repeat that feat over the next three years, at least without a major new expansion of the business, but a double seems like a reasonable goal. Can it get there? Investors just got some clues in its latest earnings report.\n\nQ2 was a hit with viewers, but not investors\n\nNetflix stock slipped 5% on the second-quarter report on Friday. The numbers were strong, but the recent surge in the share price has raised expectations for the company. Revenue was up 16% to $11.1 billion, marking its fastest growth rate in four quarters, but the result essentially matched estimates.\n\nThe streamer stopped reporting subscriber counts, so it's not as easy to see what's driving the business growth. Management said it was driven by a combination of subscriber additions, growth in the ad business, and price hikes in markets like North America. The company is now using its proprietary ad tech platform, Netflix Ads Suite, in all of its markets, showing it's rapidly embraced advertising as part of the core driver of its business.\n\nThanks to its subscription business model, the company's profit margin continues to expand as the business grows, and the ad business is likely contributing to margin growth as it's allowed the company to monetize its content in a new way and attract budget-conscious subscribers who didn't want to pay for the ad-free tier. Operating margin expanded from 27.2% in the quarter a year ago to 34.1%, and earnings per share (EPS) jumped from $4.88 to $7.19, beating the consensus at $7.06.\n\nManagement warned that margins would fall in the second half of the year as content expenses grew. Its third-quarter guidance, for example, called for 31.5% operating margin, but the company also raised its full-year guidance from $43.5 billion-$44.5 billion to $44.8 billion-$45.2 billion. It now sees currency-neutral operating margin expanding to 29.5%, up from a previous forecast at 29%.\n\nThe business seems to be firing on all cylinders as the ad engine takes off. Netflix continues to expand the breadth of its content with several series and films bringing audiences of 50 million or more in the quarter.\n\nMembers watched 95 billion hours in the first half of the year, a 1% increase, and the company's local content strategy is paying off, as well, as non-English content now represents more than a third of its viewing. Those trends all bode well for the business over the next three years.\n\nCan Netflix stock get to $2,500?\n\nNetflix's surge over the last three years is primarily due to the improvements in the business, but it's also benefited from multiple expansion. You can see that in the chart below, though that doesn't include the most recent quarter.\n\nFactoring in second-quarter earnings, Netflix's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) would be closer to 50, but that's still pricey, especially for a stock that was regarded as mature not long ago.\n\nFor Netflix to double from here, it will likely have to earn it on its own merits, as Friday's post-earnings sell-off shows, despite the strong results. Investors seem to feel the stock now has enough growth baked in, which makes further gains more difficult.\n\nNetflix can double earnings per share, but it may take more than three years to do it. Still, with its double-digit revenue, expanding operating margins, and potential to expand into new businesses, doubling EPS in the next five years seems like a fair assumption.\n\nThe streaming stock could double by 2028 but will have to top an already high bar. That won't be easy.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:47:20.547421+00:00"}

More significantly, Netflix raised its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to $44.8-$45.2 billion from the previous range of $43.5-$44.5 billion. This upward revision indicates anticipated growth of 15%-16% on a reported basis, or 16%-17% when adjusted for foreign exchange fluctuations. The increase in revenues stems from multiple growth drivers working in tandem. Member growth accelerated toward the end of the second quarter, exceeding internal forecasts, while the company's advertising business continues gaining traction with expectations to roughly double ad revenues in 2025. Currency effects also provided a tailwind, as U.S. dollar weakness against major currencies enhanced international revenue contributions when translated back to dollars. For third-quarter 2025, Netflix projects revenues of $11.526 billion, representing 17% growth on both reported and currency-neutral bases. This guidance suggests sustained momentum across pricing, membership expansion, and advertising monetization. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFLX’s 2025 revenues is pegged at $44.85 billion, indicating 15% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $25.81 per share, indicating a 30.16% increase from the previous year.\n\nNetflix NFLX delivered another solid quarterly performance in second-quarter 2025, beating analyst expectations and raising full-year guidance across multiple metrics. (Read More: Netflix Q2 Earnings Beat on Squid Game Finale, 2025 Outlook Raised) The streaming giant's results demonstrate continued momentum in subscriber growth, advertising revenues, and content engagement, though investors face the question of whether current valuations offer attractive entry points or warrant a patient approach. Netflix has delivered impressive returns for shareholders so far in 2025, with the streaming giant's shares surging approximately 35.7% year to date, significantly outpacing other streaming competitors like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Disney DIS, as well as the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500. Shares of Apple have lost 14.5%, while Disney and Amazon have returned 8.8% and 3.6% in the same time frame, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\n\nMargin Expansion Reflects Operational Efficiency\n\nNetflix's profitability outlook has similarly improved, with the company raising its full-year operating margin target to 29.5% on a currency-neutral basis from the previous 29% forecast. At current exchange rates, this translates to approximately 30% reported operating margin for 2025. The second-quarter operating margin of 34% demonstrated the company's ability to scale efficiently while investing heavily in content.\n\n\n\nThe improved margin guidance primarily reflects the revenue upside flowing through to profitability, as operating expenses remain largely unchanged from previous forecasts. This operational leverage underscores Netflix's maturing business model, where incremental revenue growth translates more directly to bottom-line expansion.\n\n\n\nFree cash flow projections have also increased to $8.0-$8.5 billion from approximately $8.0 billion previously, reflecting the enhanced revenues and margin outlook. This cash generation capability supports continued content investment while enabling shareholder returns through share repurchases.\n\nRobust Content Pipeline Supports Long-Term Growth\n\nNetflix's content slate in the second half of 2025 represents one of its strongest lineups, featuring highly anticipated returns of marquee franchises. The fifth and final season of Stranger Things headlines the offering, alongside the second season of Wednesday and the third season of Alice in Borderland. These established properties have demonstrated significant global appeal and engagement metrics.\n\n\n\nThe new content pipeline spans diverse genres and international markets, including Billionaires' Bunker from Money Heist creator Álex Pina, the thriller Black Rabbit starring Jason Bateman and Jude Law, and House of Guinness from Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight. This international approach aligns with Netflix's successful \"local for local\" strategy while creating content with broader market potential.\n\n\n\nFilm offerings include major sequels like Happy Gilmore 2 and prestige projects from Academy Award winners, including Kathryn Bigelow's A House of Dynamite and Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein. The diverse slate positions Netflix to capture engagement across demographic segments and viewing preferences.\n\nLive Programming Expansion Creates New Opportunities\n\nNetflix's expansion into live programming continues with significant sporting events, including marquee boxing matches and the NFL Christmas Day doubleheader. These events serve multiple strategic purposes: driving subscriber acquisition, commanding premium advertising rates, and creating appointment viewing that enhances engagement metrics.\n\n\n\nThe live programming strategy represents a differentiated approach within the streaming landscape, potentially creating competitive advantages in both subscriber retention and advertising monetization as the company scales these capabilities.\n\nInvestment Considerations and Outlook\n\nNetflix's second-quarter results and raised guidance demonstrate continued execution across key operational metrics. The combination of subscriber growth, advertising revenue expansion, margin improvement, and strong content pipeline suggests the company remains well-positioned for sustained growth.\n\n\n\nHowever, investors should consider current valuations relative to growth expectations and competitive dynamics within streaming. Netflix trades at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S ratio of 10.81 compared to the broader Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward earnings multiple of 4.48. The raised guidance may already be reflected in current share prices, potentially limiting near-term upside despite strong fundamentals.\n\nNFLX’s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Premium Valuation\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nFor existing shareholders, the results support a hold strategy given the company's demonstrated ability to execute across multiple growth vectors. New investors might consider waiting for more attractive entry points, particularly given the strong execution already evident in current valuations. The company's improving cash generation and margin expansion provide downside protection while the content pipeline supports long-term growth prospects. NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

They are funded by all of us and at the end of the day they need to make content where people are viewing it.”\n\nIn a report published on Monday, Ofcom warned that the precipitous growth of streaming services and video apps such as YouTube and TikTok meant younger audiences may not form a connection with traditional broadcasters.\n\nResearch found that only adults aged 35 and older were most likely to turn to BBC One when seeking out things to watch. In contrast, Netflix is the most popular destination for 16 to 34-year-olds, while children aged between four and 15 are most likely to turn to YouTube.\n\nThe crisis for broadcasters is most acute among teenagers, with 13 to 15-year-olds spending nearly half their in-home viewing time on YouTube and TikTok.\n\nIn a speech earlier this year, BBC director-general Tim Davie said the corporation would start making news programming specifically for streaming platforms and social media apps.\n\nChannel 4, which has a remit to serve young viewers, has already struck deals with both YouTube and Spotify to make online-specific shows, while ITV last year inked a deal to put hundreds of hours of programmes on YouTube.\n\nThe race to win back younger viewers has seen traditional broadcasters turn to shorter-form videos, while some have also signed up popular influencers and YouTube personalities.\n\nBut Ofcom warned traditional channels had more to do as they accounted for only a small proportion of Britons’ online viewing. Only about a fifth of the time Britons spend on YouTube is spent on content made in the UK, while North America accounts for more than half.\n\nMs Nicolotti Squires insisted that PSBs could branch out into different types of shows without overlooking their traditional programmes and audiences.

Year over year, Netflix’s Q2 EPS spiked 47% from $4.88 in Q2 2024. This came on Q2 sales of $11.07 billion, which increased 16% from the comparative quarter but slightly missed estimates of $11.08 billion.\n\nNotably, Netflix’s operating margin during Q2 was 34.1%, up from 24% a year ago, with free cash flow soaring 91% to $2.3 billion.\n\nNetflix’s Q2 Subscriber Growth\n\nAlthough Netflix no longer reports official quarterly subscriber numbers, the streaming giant is thought to have added 5.1 million new net subscribers during Q2. However, this fell below many analysts' forecast of 6 million and was down from 8.05 million new net subscribers in Q2 2024.\n\nStill, Netflix’s total subscribers have risen to over 300 million thanks to its global reach, strong content pipeline, and the growth of its more affordable ad-tier, keeping the company firmly ahead ofDisney’s streaming services and other platforms such as Amazon’s Prime Video and Paramount Global.\n\nNetflix's Revenue Guidance & Margin Outlook\n\nOptimistically, Netflix raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $44.8-$45.2 billion from its previous forecast of $43.5-$44.5 billion. The current Zacks Consensus calls for Netflix’s top line to expand 14% this year to $44.55 billion, with fiscal 2026 sales projected to increase another 12% to $50.05 billion.\n\nIt’s also noteworthy that Netflix slightly increased its full-year operating margin guidance from 29% to 29.5%, although many analysts were looking for a margin range between 30-31%.\n\nMonitoring Netflix’s P/E Valuation\n\nWhat may have dampened excitement for Netflix’s favorable Q2 report is that at 50X forward earnings, NFLX does trade at a noticeable premium to the broader market, with the S&P 500 at 24X. This is also well above Disney and Paramount at 21X and 9X forward earnings, respectively, and even Amazon at 35X.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:47:37.714565+00:00"}

Yet, investors largely reacted to these numbers with a collective shrug. Netflix closed down over 5% Friday despite its strong performance.\n\n“With stock valuations where they are, all the good news is priced into the market now,” said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at PenderFund Capital Management Ltd.\n\nWhat’s more, the market is penalizing results that fall short of expectations by the most in nearly three years, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence shows.\n\n“The margin of error here is small,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Investment Management. “When the valuations are high and you miss, the punishment is more severe.”\n\nCombined profit and revenue beats, on the other hand, are being rewarded by only the most in a year.\n\n“At an index level, good earnings are not likely the broad market catalyst investors are waiting for,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and quantitative strategist at Evercore ISI.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index closed near an all-time high Friday, after notching seven new records in just 15 sessions.

(Credit: Bruce Edwards/Edmonton Journal files)\n\nThere’s lots for investors to chew on this week including where analysts think streaming juggernaut Netflix is headed after posting strong stock price and earnings growth so far this year. We also share the Top 3 stock picks from one RBC Capital Markets analyst, look at some high flying drone stocks and consider if dividend-paying stocks could be back in style.\n\nStock of the week: Netflix Inc.\n\nShares of Netflix Inc. (NFLX) are up 41 per cent this year, though the streaming giant’s stock took a short intermission on Friday, falling five per cent after reporting earnings that beat estimates, as the company failed to meet steep expectations. The stock is down 10 per cent from its all-time high on June 30. Regardless, analysts lined up to raise their price targets on the shares, which are currently trading around US$1,215. UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley & Co. and JPMorgan Chase and Co. all hiked their price targets, with UBS citing “solid momentum” based on the earnings outlook. Bank of America Corp., which put a price target of US$1,490 on the shares, said Netflix has “growth drivers that should prove to be defensive.”\n\n3 ideas for investors\n\nRBC Capital Markets has three ideas for investors: Brookfield Corp. (BN), Element Fleet Management Corp. (EFN) and Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH). Brookfield is the top idea of analyst Bart Dziarski who describes it as a “core holding driven by its long-term track record of compounding capital.” The stock is trading around $93 making for a “good entry point,” Dziarski said. Element is his top growth pick and he is forecasting double-digit gains in earnings per share and return on equity, “underpinned by a lower-risk business model with a sticky client base.” It is trading at $35.46. Fairfax is Dziarski’s value pick. He argues that it is undervalued compared to peers. “Fairfax’s investment portfolio has been re-positioned to take advantage of the current interest rate environment driving improving investment results, which we expect to continue,” he said. It is trading at $2,420.09. Dziarski has price targets of $111.07 on Brookfield, $43 on Element and $2,811.37 on Fairfax.\n\nKeeping score\n\nHigh-flying drone stocks\n\nIs the sky the limit for drone stocks? The fly zone appears to have opened up after U.S. defence secretary Pete Hegseth last week announced a major policy shift regarding the manufacturing and use of drones emphasizing a buy-American philosophy in a statement made on the lawn of Pentagon with drones of all shapes and sizes hovering in the background. Following Hegseth’s announcement on July 10, drone stocks jumped across the board and continued their runs this week. Among the notable gainers, ZenaTech Inc. (ZENA) is up nearly 100 per cent to US$6.35 from US$3.28 last week while Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc. (KTOS), which has the largest market capitalization in the sector at US$9.9 billion, is up 27 per cent. For investors looking to get into the drone space, some other U.S.-listed options include AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. (UAVS), Red Cat Holdings Inc. (RCAT) and Unusual Machines Inc. (UMAC).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:47:48.025544+00:00"}

Net income for the quarter came in at $3.1 billion, or $7.19 per share, a sharp improvement from $2.1 billion, or $4.88 per share, a year earlier.\n\nDriving the gains? A combination of healthy subscriber growth, higher subscription pricing, and a continued ramp-up in advertising revenue, Netflix said in its earnings statement.\n\nWhile Netflix no longer reports quarterly subscriber numbers, the company raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion, up from the earlier $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion range partially due to a weaker U.S. dollar and strong engagement across markets.\n\nOperating metrics also impressed. Free cash flow surged 91% to $2.3 billion, while cash generated from operations rose more than 84%, reaching $2.4 billion. Netflix now expects full-year free cash flow between $8 billion and $8.5 billion, up from its earlier $8 billion estimate.\n\nAnother highlight: the operating margin climbed to 34.1%, nearly 7 points higher than the same period last year. But there was a catch. Netflix warned that operating margins in the second half of 2025 will shrink thanks to higher content costs and marketing tied to its massive slate of upcoming shows and films.\n\nWith blockbuster content on the way including the second season of Wednesday, the finale of Stranger Things, and Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein the company appears poised for a busy back half.\n\nStill, that margin outlook left a mark. Shares slipped roughly 1% in after-hours trading, as investors weighed the costs of keeping the content pipeline flowing.\n\nNetflix's strategy seems clear: keep subscribers hooked with premium content while continuing to squeeze more value from both pricing and ads. But with content spending rising and Wall Street watching margins closely, the road ahead could be a balancing act.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:47:49.883573+00:00"}

This came on Q2 sales of $11.07 billion, which increased 16% from the comparative quarter but slightly missed estimates of $11.08 billion.\n\nNotably, Netflix’s operating margin during Q2 was 34.1%, up from 24% a year ago, with free cash flow soaring 91% to $2.3 billion.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNetflix’s Q2 Subscriber Growth\n\nAlthough Netflix no longer reports official quarterly subscriber numbers, the streaming giant is thought to have added 5.1 million new net subscribers during Q2. However, this fell below many analysts' forecast of 6 million and was down from 8.05 million new net subscribers in Q2 2024.\n\nStill, Netflix’s total subscribers have risen to over 300 million thanks to its global reach, strong content pipeline, and the growth of its more affordable ad-tier, keeping the company firmly ahead of Disney’s DIS streaming services and other platforms such as Amazon’s AMZN Prime Video and Paramount Global PARA.\n\nNetflix's Revenue Guidance & Margin Outlook\n\nOptimistically, Netflix raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $44.8-$45.2 billion from its previous forecast of $43.5-$44.5 billion. The current Zacks Consensus calls for Netflix’s top line to expand 14% this year to $44.55 billion, with fiscal 2026 sales projected to increase another 12% to $50.05 billion.\n\nIt’s also noteworthy that Netflix slightly increased its full-year operating margin guidance from 29% to 29.5%, although many analysts were looking for a margin range between 30-31%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMonitoring Netflix’s P/E Valuation\n\nWhat may have dampened excitement for Netflix’s favorable Q2 report is that at 50X forward earnings, NFLX does trade at a noticeable premium to the broader market, with the S&P 500 at 24X. This is also well above Disney and Paramount at 21X and 9X forward earnings, respectively, and even Amazon at 35X.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:48:00.896200+00:00"}

Do you not have the confidence that they can be number one in this larger streaming landscape or is your neutral reading more rooted in that valuation concern?\n\n00:24 Jason Helfstein\n\nOh no, they're definitely number one. They've been number one for a very long time. Um, I can't think of a time when they weren't number one in the streaming wars. Um, what I would say is that the the I actually think what's happened is portfolio managers that have been long sort of mag 7 stocks um, began to look at the landscape and say, hey, wait a minute, I've got some of these big tech companies have AI threats, some of them have DOJ threats, you know, earlier in the year the market was nervous about a recession. And so the PMs began to look for give me a stock that doesn't have AI risk, that doesn't have recession risk, that doesn't have DOJ risk. And Netflix checked all those boxes. So it's sort of a safe harbor and that caused the multiple to expand, but it wasn't really underpinned by sort of parallel acceleration in the top line.\n\n02:09 Jason Helfstein\n\nThat's why we're neutral.\n\n02:11 Speaker A\n\nGot it. And and and what could Netflix do? I mean, I guess, you know, the share price is sort of out of their control, obviously. True. But in terms of operationally, are there things that they can do? I know that the company has said it prefers to grow internally, doesn't prefer to make acquisitions, but do you think that would be a good a good avenue to take for them?\n\n03:01 Jason Helfstein\n\nWell, I think the the boardroom level discussion has to be, um, does Netflix want to pivot and sort of embrace user generated content? Um, you know, they obviously care about time spent on the app. That's why they've moved into video games. Um, you know, not a lot of success there so far. But the question is, if you're if you're sitting there at the boardroom and you're watching YouTube go from 8 to 12% market share of the last 18 months, do you begin to embrace UGC content? They could do that in sort of a half-step way or go all in. The half-step way would be to take some of these famous content creators and give them their own Netflix show and try and lean into that. The full throated way is really more of a strategic pivot and try and take on YouTube directly by actually sort of surfacing up user generated content on the app. That that's that's the central question for the board.\n\n04:56 Speaker B\n\nAlex, go ahead and get in here.\n\n05:00 Alex\n\nAnd Jason, yeah, I I wanted to ask some follow up there on UFC media rights. I I mentioned that when I was talking about some of the takeaways here and they still seem to to skirt around the idea of live sports content. Do you think they need to double down on this considering the success we've seen on the WWE front?\n\n05:45 Jason Helfstein\n\nWell, I think I think they need to move into live content uh to a greater extent. I think the challenge is a little bit um the challenge I frame it this way. What what because Netflix's distribution is so unrivaled, they know that any sports that they bring onto the platform, what you're going to see is the engagement levels rise. And so what that means is at the end of a three or five-year sports deal, the rights owner is going to come back to Netflix and say, hey, look how great our our sports content is doing. I want a giant step up in my in the price of this content. Netflix's response of course will be no, the only reason your viewership is up is because you're on our globally leading distribution platform. And so what that means is Netflix has to look for sports rights um where the where the growth is maybe more muted and even the seller of those rights knows that the growth is more muted. It's a mature sport. So if you have any sort of high flying sport like UFC, um that's really not going to check the box because Netflix is going to want to do a 10-year deal or a 20-year deal to insulate itself from the lift and distribution that it's that its platform is going to give. And so the question is when you look at all the sports rights, what seller of sports rights is going to acknowledge, yeah, my sports is really mature. I'm not really going to get much engagement and therefore would be willing to do not a customary five-year deal but a 10 or a 20-year deal. That's the threshold question.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:48:03.141155+00:00"}

The momentum gauge tracks the speed of a stock’s recent price changes and a reading over 70 is a signal to some analysts that buying is at extreme levels.\n\n“It’s definitely getting overbought, and while that doesn’t mean a reversal is imminent, this is something to be mindful of,” said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG. “It feels like sentiment, which had been optimistic, is getting borderline giddy.”\n\nNvidia, which dominates the market for chips used in artificial intelligence computing, has staged a dramatic reversal since April when a broad tariff-induced selloff added to fears about a potential pullback in AI spending. Since then, the firm’s biggest customers have continued to plow more money into the development of AI services and investors have flocked back to the stock, pushing it up more than 80% in less than four months. The stock fell as much as 1% on Friday.\n\nThe latest leg of the rally has been driven by news that Nvidia plans to resume sales of some AI chips in China with the approval of the US government. The policy reversal from President Donald Trump’s administration could help recover a large chunk of the $15 billion in Nvidia’s fiscal 2026 data center revenue that had been at risk from US chip export restrictions, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kunjan Sobhani.\n\nThis week, Trump also touted more than $92 billion in commitments to invest in AI and energy infrastructure, while Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg affirmed plans to spend “hundreds of billions of dollars” on data center investments. The Facebook parent is Nvidia’s second-largest customer, after Microsoft Corp., according to supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nNvidia is on track for its eighth-straight week of gains and the rally from its April low has added roughly $1.9 trillion to its market value, a figure that alone exceeds the market capitalization of Meta. At more than $4.2 trillion, Nvidia is again the world’s most valuable company, topping second-ranked Microsoft by about $400 billion.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:48:10.033155+00:00"}

Netflix posted second-quarter revenue of $11.08 billion, a 16% increase from the prior year, and raised its revenue forecast for the full year. Net income also surged. The sell-off appeared to be driven by the company's guidance on operating margins. Management warned investors that margins in the second half of 2025 were expected to be weaker due to higher spending on content and marketing. With the stock having gained roughly 40% year-to-date before the announcement, investors seemed to focus on the future cost pressures rather than the strong quarterly performance.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Netflix? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nNetflix’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 6 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock gained 15.4% on the news that the company reported impressive fourth-quarter results, which blew past analysts' global streaming paid memberships expectations, with a strong net add figure (18.9 million vs. estimates of 9.8 million). This led to a revenue and EPS beat in the quarter.\n\nAdditionally, revenue guidance for 2025 beat expectations, and the company spoke optimistically about multiple vectors such as ad revenue, live events, and new content. Netflix's decision to increase pricing on certain subscription plans also reflected management's confidence in its content's quality and suggests potential benefits for both sales and profitability.\n\nOverall, this quarter was strong. Following the strong performance, Barclays upgraded the stock's rating from Sell to Hold, adding, \"The company's continued outperformance largely disproves our hypothesis on growth mean reversion and while growth will slow in '25, current operating momentum if sustained, could drive further upside.\"\n\nNetflix is up 37% since the beginning of the year, but at $1,215 per share, it is still trading 9.3% below its 52-week high of $1,339 from June 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Netflix’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,418.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

Um, but look, you go into the fundamentals of Netflix. They hit everything that I want to see as a former stock analyst. Margins up, revenue growth accelerated quarter over quarter, outlook raised, they got a new giant content slate coming out in the second half of the year. Not only live experiences, what with the double header on Christmas Day, you have Happy Gilmore 2 dropping. That's exciting. I don't know what else Netflix could have did yesterday.\n\n00:55 Speaker B\n\nYeah, and if you look through all the analyst notes, it's what I've been doing all morning. Everyone is still pretty bullish, but they did say that it's really hard as a company to surpass elevated expectations. Earlier, I was talking about the valuation, 40 times forward earnings. The stock is up over 40% since the start of the year. So perhaps they wanted that full year guidance to come in a little more ahead of where we're at, considering where the stock is trading right now and all those catalysts still to come, like you were just mentioning, Brian. But by and large, this is a company that has a solid balance sheet. It even has some AI touch points. They are going to be using generative AI in their shows. And as we know, any company that has those AI adjacent business propositions, that's going to be rewarded by investors. So there just seems to be a lot of growth drivers here. Advertising, in particular, has been one that's stuck out. It's one of the cheapest ad plans on the market. They're continuing to see solid growth there, and they are expected to double their revenue by the end of this year to around 3 billion, and a lot of analysts and sources who I speak with say that now subscriber numbers are no longer available, to focus on those ad numbers because that's an area where we're going to consistently see a lot of top-line growth. So that's, that's really strong. We have the content side of the equation that's really strong, a really solid back half of the year, and like you said, nothing really disappointed me in this report either. But when you're dealing with investors that just have a high bar, sometimes, even that struggles on the stock price side of things.\n\n03:17 Speaker A\n\nUh, so I'm going to sum up what Ali just said, Chad. Netflix is a fundamental beast. Now, having said that, this reaction that we're seeing in the market to these very strong earnings and outlook, any read, any read through there to large cap tech earnings that are going to come over the next two weeks. Microsoft, bioindications are probably going to come out here, good quarter, beat, relatively upbeat earnings call. Is the risk here, we got to sell off there too?\n\n04:01 Chad\n\nWell, I mean, all these tech names, uh, on the MAG 7 side have been moving higher in anticipation of a really white hot earnings, uh, top line revenue growth, and whatnot. Uh, so, yes, you can get a breather where there is some consolidation within the market overall. But again, you know, there's a lot of tailwind here when it comes to the AI related companies, revenue growth. This is real revenue growth, real earnings coming through. Uh, so, over the long run, if that you have that, then you should see higher highs within these names.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:48:34.084794+00:00"}

The figure jumped 47.3% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues came in slightly above the company guidance at $11.07 billion, increasing 16% year over year or 17% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis, driven primarily by membership growth and higher subscription pricing and increased ad revenues. The figure missed the consensus mark by 0.06%. The second-quarter content slate wrapped up on a high note as Squid Game S3 (122M views) became the company’s sixth biggest season of any series in just a few weeks of viewing. All regions experienced healthy year-over-year revenue growth, with each region posting double-digit F/X neutral increases. UCAN revenue growth accelerated year over year to 15% compared with 9% year-over-year growth in the first quarter due to the full quarter impact of price changes. (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.) In a notable shift, Netflix has moved away from reporting specific subscriber count, starting with the first quarter of 2025, preferring instead to focus on financial metrics and user engagement. While tech giants like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN do not reveal subscriber figures for their respective streaming services, other media companies do. Disney DIS separately breaks out Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ figures.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOperating Details\n\nMarketing expenses increased 10.7% year over year to $713.3 million. As a percentage of revenues, marketing expenses expanded 30 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 6.4%. Technology and development expenses increased 15.9% year over year to $824.7 million. As a percentage of revenues, technology and development expenses expanded 70 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 7.4%. General and administration expenses increased 3.3% year over year to $441.2 million. As a percentage of revenues, general and administration expenses contracted 10 bps on a year-over-year basis to 4%.\n\n\n\nOperating income totaled $3.8 billion, up 45% year over year, and operating margin was 34% compared with 27% in the year-ago period. Both were slightly ahead of the company forecast, given the revenue upside in the quarter and the timing of expense spending. The second quarter was the first full quarter in which Netflix launched new price increases, including in mature markets like the United States. The price hikes, combined with consistent low churn, likely account for the strong margins.\n\nBalance Sheet & Free Cash Flow\n\nNetflix had $8.17 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025, compared with $7.19 billion as of March 31, 2025.\n\n\n\nTotal debt was $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2025, compared with $15.01 billion as of March 31, 2025.\n\n\n\nStreaming content obligations were $20.96 billion as of June 30, 2025, compared with $21.79 billion as of March 31, 2025.\n\n\n\nNetflix reported a free cash flow of $2.3 billion compared with a free cash flow of $2.66 billion in the previous quarter.\n\n\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities in the second quarter was $2.4 billion compared with $1.3 billion in the prior year period.\n\n\n\nDuring the quarter, Netflix paid down $1 billion of USD and EUR senior notes using proceeds from 2024 refinancing, and repurchased 1.5 million shares for $1.6 billion. Netflix has $12 billion remaining under its existing share repurchase authorization.\n\n\n\nIn May 2025, NFLX established a commercial paper (CP) program, providing the company with enhanced flexibility and the ability to issue short-term, unsecured notes in an aggregate amount of up to $3 billion.\n\nGuidance\n\nNetflix has raised its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to $44.8-$45.2 billion from the previous guidance of $43.5-$44.5 billion. This indicates year-over-year growth of 15%-16% or 16%-17% on a foreign exchange neutral basis. The increase in the revenue forecast primarily reflects the recent depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus most other currencies, along with continued business momentum driven by solid member growth and advertising sales.\n\n\n\nThe company is now targeting a foreign exchange neutral operating margin of 29.5% for 2025, up from the prior 29% forecast, which would equate to roughly 30% operating margin on a reported basis at current exchange rates. Netflix has also increased its free cash flow forecast to $8.0-$8.5 billion from approximately $8.0 billion previously due to the improved revenue and operating margin outlook.\n\n\n\nFor the third quarter of 2025, Netflix expects revenues of $11.526 billion, indicating growth of 17% on both a reported and foreign exchange neutral basis. Revenues are expected to be driven by growth in members, pricing and advertising revenues. The company projects an operating margin of 31% for the quarter, which represents a two percentage point improvement year over year. However, Netflix expects that similar to past years, operating margin in the second half of 2025 will be lower than the first half due to higher content amortization and sales and marketing costs associated with its larger second-half content slate.\n\n\n\nNetflix's second-half 2025 slate features highly anticipated returns of several major franchises. The lineup includes the second season of Wednesday, the Emmy-nominated second season of Nobody Wants This, the third season of Alice in Borderland from Japan, and most notably, the fifth and final season of Stranger Things. These returning series represent some of Netflix's most valuable intellectual properties and are expected to drive significant member engagement.\n\n\n\nThe platform is launching several ambitious new series, including Billionaires' Bunker from Money Heist creator Álex Pina, the thriller Black Rabbit starring Jason Bateman and Jude Law, House of Guinness from Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight, and Las Muertas from Mexico. This diverse international lineup demonstrates Netflix's continued commitment to its \"local for local\" content strategy while creating programming with global appeal.\n\n\n\nNetflix's film offerings for the remainder of 2025 include major sequels and original productions. Comedy sequels include Happy Gilmore 2 with Adam Sandler and Tyler Perry's Madea's Destination Wedding, while the mystery genre gets Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. International offerings include Troll 2 from Norway and French Lover starring Lupin's Omar Sy. The prestige film category features Academy Award winner Kathryn Bigelow's A House of Dynamite, Noah Baumbach's Jay Kelly starring George Clooney and Adam Sandler, and Academy Award winner Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein. The animated slate includes In Your Dreams, and romance gets My Oxford Year starring Sofia Carson and Corey Mylchreest.\n\n\n\nThe unscripted slate includes Building the Band (which premiered recently), America's Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys, the ninth season of Love is Blind, and a new documentary about Victoria Beckham.\n\n\n\nNetflix continues to expand its live programming with major sporting events, including two marquee boxing matches in the third quarter featuring the Taylor vs. Serrano rematch and the highly anticipated Canelo vs. Crawford fight on Sept. 13. The live programming culminates with Netflix's NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, featuring compelling divisional matchups like Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders and Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Revenues rose 16% year over year to $11.08 billion and were slightly below the consensus estimate of $11.09 billion. The company remains unscathed by the ongoing tariff chaos, as the entertainment industry demonstrates its resilience in tough economic times. Netflix's low-cost advertising-supported service plan should provide it with greater resilience if the macroeconomic climate worsens (read: Tariff-Led Volatility Ahead for Big Tech? ETFs in Focus).

The upcoming quarters boast a robust lineup, including the second season of Wednesday, the Stranger Things finale, the Canelo-Crawford live boxing match, Adam Sandler’s Happy Gilmore 2, Kathryn Bigelow’s A House of Dynamite, and Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein.

It expects revenues to be in the range of $44.8-$45.2 billion, up from $43.5-$44.5 billion.

Just closed short of that yesterday, so looking to see modest gains in that major index today. That's as investors are digesting Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller's call for the Central Bank to cut interest rates in July. Waller saying in a speech Thursday night in New York that, quote, \"With inflation near target and the upside risk to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.\" Waller believes tariffs will offer one-time price increases that the Fed should look through, adding that the Central Bank's current benchmark should be closer to 3%, more than a full percentage point lower than where the Fed funds rate currently sits.

That’s because it has some big releases on the schedule, including new series of Stranger Things and Wednesday, and it plans to market them heavily.\n\n“Investors didn’t like the fact that the core of its upgraded revenue guidance was foreign-exchange related rather than demand-driven. It is benefiting from the weakening US dollar relative to most other currencies.\n\n“Shares in Netflix ( NFLX ) fell in pre-market trading following the results even though the company is going from strength to strength. Investors took fright at a few points in the update and locked in some profit after the shares doubled in value over the past 12 months.\n\n\"Better than expected quarterly results and upgraded full-year revenue and cash flow guidance weren’t enough to keep investors happy.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell ( AJB.L ), said: \"Despite the strong numbers, Netflix’s ( NFLX ) shares pulled back by approximately 1.7% in pre-market trading. Analysts suggested the drop may be attributed to high expectations already priced into the stock, combined with profit-taking and investor caution over the company’s premium valuation.\n\nHowever, it warned that “operating margin in the second half of 2025 will be lower than the first half due to higher content amortisation and sales and marketing costs associated with our larger second half slate\".\n\n“Year-over-year revenue growth was primarily a function of more members, higher subscription pricing and increased ad revenue,” the company said in a statement.\n\nNetflix ( NFLX ) revealed that this would be the second consecutive quarter it would not release specific subscription data updates.\n\nThe company also raised its full-year revenue forecast, now expecting between $44.8bn and $45.2bn, up from a prior range of $43.5bn to $44.5bn. The upward revision was driven by the weakening US dollar relative to other currencies, as well as \"healthy\" member growth and an increase in advertising revenue, Netflix ( NFLX ) said in a statement.\n\nFor the second quarter, Netflix ( NFLX ) saw a 16% increase in revenue, reaching $11.08bn (£8.24bn). Net profit surged by 46%, amounting to $3.1bn. These figures slightly exceeded the company's initial guidance for the period.\n\nShares in Netflix ( NFLX ) were in the red ahead of the US opening after the streaming giant reported a modest beat-and-raise earnings report overnight.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Netflix (NFLX) is betting that extra marketing spend could lead to a big uplift in customer numbers. This isn’t a gamble; it’s a calculated ploy that could yield big results.\n\n“Member growth already improved more than expected at the end of the second quarter, and advertising-related income looks interesting.\n\n“Netflix (NFLX) plans to spend big bucks to strengthen its advertising sales infrastructure and capabilities. Many investors don’t like it when money is going out the door rather than coming in. In reality, Netflix is spending money today to potentially make a lot more money tomorrow.\n\nUber (UBER)\n\nShares in Uber (UBER) were flat in pre-market trading despite its announcement of a partnership to deploy more than 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years as demand for driverless cars kicks into high gear.\n\nAs part of the partnership, the ride-hailing company is collaborating with Lucid (LCID), the electric vehicle maker, and Nuro (NURO.PVT), an autonomous vehicle startup. Under the deal, Uber (UBER) will invest $300m in Lucid.\n\nMeanwhile, Nuro (NURO.PVT) will develop the self-driving technology that Lucid (LCID) will integrate into vehicles to supply Uber (UBER) with robotaxis throughout the duration of the partnership, with Nuro also set to receive a multi-hundred-million-dollar investment.\n\nLucid’s (LCID) stock surged 36% on Thursday following the announcement.\n\nThe companies plan to launch the robotaxis in a major US urban hub next year. Over the course of six years starting in 2026, Uber (UBER) will acquire and deploy more than 20,000 Lucid (LCID) Gravity SUVs, each equipped with Nuro’s (NURO.PVT) autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, according to a statement from the three companies.\n\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Nuro (NURO.PVT) and Lucid (LCID) on this new robotaxi programme, purpose-built just for the Uber (UBER) platform, to safely bring the magic of autonomous driving to more people across the world,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a statement.\n\nShares in BP (BP.L) were higher in early morning trade as the oil major took another step in its strategic pivot back to oil and gas by agreeing to sell its US onshore wind business to LS Power.\n\nThe wind business operates nine onshore wind energy assets across seven US states, all of which are grid-connected and provide power to customers. The wind farms are all operational and have a combined capacity of 1.7GW, of which BP (BP.L) owns 1.3GW.\n\nAfter completion of the deal, which is expected before the end of the year, BP Wind Energy will form part of LS Power’s subsidiary Clearlight Energy, increasing the North American energy group’s operating fleet to about 4.3GW.\n\nThe move comes as BP (BP.L) seeks to streamline its business and refocus on its core oil and gas operation.\n\nWilliam Lin, BP’s (BP.L) executive vice president for gas and low carbon energy, said: “We have been clear that while low carbon energy has a role to play in a simpler, more focused bp, we will continue to rationalise and optimise our portfolio to generate value.\n\n\"The onshore US wind business has great assets and fantastic people, but we have concluded we are no longer the best owners to take it forward.\"\n\nCoinbase (COIN)\n\nCoinbase (COIN), the largest US crypto exchange, saw its shares climb as the US House passed two major pieces of legislation designed to bring structure to digital asset markets, a move investors interpreted as a step toward long-awaited regulatory clarity.\n\nCoinbase’s (COIN) shares gained 3.2% during the session, closing above $410 for the first time, pushing the company’s market cap above $100bn. The stock further increased in pre-market trading, reaching $418.\n\nThis surge came after the House passed the Clarity Act, which addresses crypto market structure oversight, and the Genius Act, which lays out a framework for regulating stablecoins. The stablecoin bill, which already cleared the Senate last month, is now poised for potential signing into law.\n\nCoinbase (COIN), which offers futures trading in the US and spot and perpetual futures products outside the US, stands to benefit significantly from the passage of these bills.\n\nRead more: Why Apple, Amazon and other tech giants are considering bitcoin\n\n“It’s really urgent for us to get it settled so that investors can invest in the sector, and that tokens that are issued can be traded on our platform,” Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s (COIN) chief policy officer, said on Wednesday.\n\nThe stablecoin market, currently valued around $240bn, is projected to see substantial growth, with some high-end estimates forecasting a market size of $1tn or more in the coming years. Coinbase (COIN) also holds a stake in Circle (CRCL), the largest US stablecoin issuer.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) was up by 1% to $119,852 at the time of writing.\n\nShares in Burberry (BRBY.L) were higher in London as the luxury fashion brand reported a smaller-than-expected drop in sales, signaling early signs of progress under new CEO Joshua Schulman’s turnaround plan.\n\nFor the 13 weeks to June 28, retail revenues fell 6% to £433m, compared with the same period a year earlier, with currency fluctuations contributing to the decline. However, this figure reflects a slowdown in the company's sales downturn as Burberry works to reverse its fortunes after facing pressure from weaker luxury spending.\n\nLast November, the brand launched a £40m cost-cutting programme after reporting its first loss, and in May, it unveiled plans to cut around 1,700 jobs worldwide over the next two years as part of the restructuring.\n\nIn its fresh update, Burberry (BRBY.L) said it has made some progress in its transformation efforts but is still in the “early stages” of the potential turnaround.\n\nThe company said: “In the first half, we are continuing to prioritise investment and expect to see the impact of our initiatives build as the year progresses.”\n\nIt pointed towards efforts to simplify its operations and improve productivity in a bid to improve profit margins.\n\nIn the latest quarter, Burberry (BRBY.L) said there were improvements across its main regions, amid strong sales of “outerwear and scarves”.\n\nKey to Burberry’s recent success has been its appeal to a diverse set of consumers, with festivalgoers helping drive sales. Burberry has targeted younger, more trend-conscious luxury shoppers with pop-up shops at music festivals featuring DJ sets and activations in shopping malls.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nComparable retail sales grew by 1% in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) as positive local spending helped to offset declines among tourists.\n\nMeanwhile, its Americas business reported growth of 4% for the quarter.\n\nHowever, it said sales in Greater China fell 5% for the quarter, while its Asia Pacific division saw a drop of 4%, driven by a “challenging performance in Japan”.\n\nAdam Vettese, market analyst for eToro said: “Burberry’s (BRBY.L) first-quarter results show the iconic British brand may finally be turning a corner or at least buttoning up its turnaround efforts. Comparable store sales dipped just 1%, far better than expected, and a marked improvement from last year’s sharp declines.\n\n“The market has received it well with shares up in early trading, as signs of turnaround efforts to recover Burberry’s brand identity are beginning to show.\n\n“The uptick today shows more coherence in execution and product strategy. It’s not a complete transformation yet, but if the team can build on this momentum, Burberry (BRBY.L) could be back in style with both consumers and investors before long.”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:48:57.500759+00:00"}

Is this due to better underlying revenue growth or specific expenses coming in better like content amortization? A: Spencer Neumann, CFO: The revenue increase primarily reflects the F/X impact from the weakening dollar, but we're also seeing strength in our underlying business with healthy member growth and increased ad sales. Operating expenses remain unchanged, allowing higher revenues to flow through to profit margins, raising our full-year reported margin target from 29% to 30%.\n\nQ: Why is operating margin guidance for the full year only 30% after the upside in 2Q and a forecast of 31.5% for the third quarter? A: Spencer Neumann, CFO: This is mostly due to timing. Content expenses will ramp in Q3 and Q4 with many big titles and live events. Despite this, we expect operating margins to be up year over year in each quarter, including Q4, with a strong full-year margin guide of 29.5% F/X-neutral and 30% reported.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:48:59.548860+00:00"}

Operating margin expanded by 7 percentage points compared to the same period last year, and free cash flow increased by an impressive 87%.\n\nMost of the growth is coming from Netflix's higher prices, as the company increased its membership plan costs in January. Also in the report, Netflix mentioned that the rollout of the Netflix Ads Suite, its proprietary ad tech platform, has been completed. Management says that it expects to roughly double ads revenue in 2025, but it is likely to become a more significant part of the company's top line in 2026 and beyond. Revenue growth was strong in all of the company's regions, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, where revenue increased 24% year over year.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Netflix spent $1.6 billion on share buybacks, and still had $8.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet.\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix expects 17.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter, although management expects operating margin to decline significantly. As management said, \"Similar to past years, we expect our operating margin in the second half of 2025 will be lower than the first half due to higher content amortization and sales and marketing costs associated with our larger second half slate.\" The company increased its full-year revenue guidance by $1 billion at the midpoint of the range.\n\nImmediate Market Reaction\n\nNetflix stock was trading slightly lower after hours, but not by much.

It's worth noting that this reaction was before management's earnings call, which is scheduled for later in the afternoon.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nAs mentioned, Netflix's ad platform was recently completed, so any insights on ad revenue in the third and fourth quarters of the year will be important to watch.\n\nIn addition, Netflix has some highly anticipated content set to be released in the second half of the year, such as the final season of Stranger Things and Happy Gilmore 2 and the live Canelo-Crawford boxing match, so it will be interesting to see if that boosts new subscribers.\n\nHelpful Resources", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:49:06.224646+00:00"}

A quarter ago, it was expected that this internet video service would post earnings of $5.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.61, delivering a surprise of +16.17%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nNetflix, which belongs to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, posted revenues of $11.08 billion for the quarter ended June 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.06%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $9.56 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nNetflix shares have added about 40.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.5%.\n\nWhat's Next for Netflix?\n\nWhile Netflix has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Netflix was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

Joining us for more analysis is Geetha Ranganathan, senior media analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Geetha, it's good to see you. So Netflix reports, we know Q2, Geetha, tends to typically be a seasonally weaker period. The stock is down about eight tenths of a percent here in the after hours, but give us your take, Geetha. What do you make of the print?\n\n00:32 Geetha Ranganathan\n\nIt was a really solid print, Josh. I mean, everything that we were hoping to see, uh, Netflix definitely delivered in terms of their revenue growth for 2Q. Uh, they came in above guidance, above expectations, in terms of operating margin. Again, uh, outperforming expectations. Uh, the big thing, I think, that investors were really focused on was commentary for the rest of the year, and they delivered there as well. So they increased their outlook for revenue growth for the full year. It's up from 13% to 15%, uh, which is pretty good. Uh, and then again, with operating margin also, they kind of raised that, but I think investors were looking for a little bit more here. So it was originally, um, forecasted at 29% for the full year operating margin. They just took that up a smidge to 29.5. I think investors were looking somewhere in the range of 30 to 35, uh, 30 to 31%. Uh, so definitely solid, maybe not spectacular, and maybe that's why we're kind of seeing a little bit of this, uh, downward movement, uh, right now.\n\n02:02 Speaker A\n\nAnd how much, Geetha, do you think it could also be, I'm just looking at the initial reaction here in the after hours, just the run this stock had. I mean, what a move into the print, Geetha, it was up, what, I I think 40% year to date.\n\n02:25 Geetha Ranganathan\n\nAbsolutely right, Josh. Up 40% year to date, trading at something like almost 50 times earnings. So in many ways you would say that this was priced to perfection. When you have a stock like that that's priced to perfection, obviously investors are thinking what's next. And when you see a report that doesn't necessarily give you something screaming in terms of catalyst, I think that leads to a little bit of, you know, maybe angst.\n\n02:56 Speaker A\n\nWhen you think about what's next, Geetha, let's talk about that content slate in the second half. I'm curious what you see there, and what what could that mean in terms of of user engagement?\n\n03:12 Geetha Ranganathan\n\nYeah, user engagement is going to be super strong, Josh. There's absolutely no doubt about that. I mean, we've seen really strong results in the first half from a fairly decent content slate, but it's nowhere near what we're going to see in in the second half. Remember, management themselves have called the second half slate an embarrassment of riches. They have some of their biggest shows coming on board. You have Wednesday, you have the last season of Stranger Things, which is going to be broken into two parts. You have an NFL game, you have boxing matches. Uh, you know, you name it, you have Happy Gilmore, Knives Out, you know, everything, everything and anything. And you know, if you kind of just look at Netflix's history in terms of content release schedule, this is arguably their their strongest six month period ever. So there is no doubt that subscriber growth is going to be extremely strong, and we've seen that momentum kind of building. And content absolutely is king, and it's going to be a key differentiator for Netflix through the rest of 2025.\n\n04:33 Speaker A\n\nAnd I know the street, Geetha, also cares a lot about content spend here. What do those trends look like looking ahead?\n\n04:44 Geetha Ranganathan\n\nThose trends actually look really, really strong as well. So remember, Netflix has guided already to spending only about $18 billion in content spend. Uh, that's pretty, that's a pretty modest increase. At the end of the day, Josh, what is happening in terms of content spend and in terms of the whole profitability equation is that you always want revenue growth to be higher than content spend growth. I mean, that's where the operating leverage in the model comes, and Netflix absolutely is demonstrating that. They are demonstrating sustained momentum in subscriber growth, they're demonstrating pricing power. And then yes, you do have content expenses going up, but not by some crazy amount. Uh, they're taking a very disciplined approach to all pieces of content, including sports, uh, which is really encouraging to see. So we know that margin is definitely on an upward trajectory here.\n\n05:57 Speaker A\n\nHow is the the competitive landscape evolving here, Geetha, for Netflix? You know, I I know in my house, the Lipton house, my six-year-old, you know, she's all about YouTube. So I'm just curious, how's the competitive environment, how's it evolving, Geetha, and Netflix's place in it?\n\n06:22 Geetha Ranganathan\n\nYeah, that's a really, really good point that you bring up, Josh, because, you know, we've kind of seen Netflix dominate when it comes to streaming platforms. I think in many cases, many investors would say Netflix has already won the streaming wars, but then month after month you look at the Nielsen Gauge report where they basically track viewing time by all of these different platforms. There is absolutely no doubt that Netflix is far ahead of its competitors. So they have about an 8 to 9% share of viewing time. That's far ahead of Disney, which is at 4%, Amazon Prime, which is at 3%, but then you just brought it up, right, the elephant in the room, YouTube. YouTube actually leads with almost a 12 to 13% share. And Netflix addresses this as well. Netflix knows that YouTube is its biggest competitor, and one thing that we are kind of worried about when we take a look at the longer term strategy for Netflix and for all of these streaming platforms is as we see more and more AI in content creation and content production, can YouTube, can a platform like that actually gain an edge? Uh, and I think Netflix is very aware of this as well, and they're going to kind of see how to beef up their content platform using some of the AI tools.\n\n08:00 Speaker A\n\nFinal question, Geetha. You know, you think about Netflix, you just think about how much data they have at their disposal. I'm just curious, do we know if and how, Geetha, Netflix is leveraging AI here?\n\n08:18 Geetha Ranganathan\n\nOh, they already, Josh, to that point, they just made a huge change in their content UI. Uh, they just revamped their whole user interface, and a lot of that is actually to feed the recommendation, the content recommendation engine, which we see. Uh, so, you know, they've tested this, you know, the way that they kind of frame it is, you know, when 50% of the population kind of comes in, they know to watch Netflix, they kind of know, they have in mind already a title that they want to watch, but 50% actually don't. And that's where the content recommendation engine can play such an important role, and we've already seen kind of machine learning guide this. And now they're using AI even more to kind of refine those, uh, the algorithm, and they're making it much more intuitive and much more easy to use. And so I think, you know, we've seen Netflix kind of always lead the game when it comes to product innovation, and they're going to continue to do that. I mean, an AI is definitely going to help them.\n\n09:28 Speaker A\n\nGeetha, we are always so lucky to have you helping us break down these results. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\n09:36 Geetha Ranganathan\n\nThank you, Josh. Thanks a lot.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:49:12.586627+00:00"}

See the stock down about 1.7% just initially here in the after hours. Joining me now is Yahoo Finance senior reporter Ali Canal. Ali, what do you see in that report?\n\n00:16 Ali Canal\n\nWell, it seems to be a solid report. So it's interesting to see the shares declined today, maybe something to dig into a little bit more in the release here, but we did beat expectations of both the top and bottom lines. In addition, Netflix raised full-year revenue guidance. So revenue coming in to 11, at just over 11 billion versus expectations. Again, that was a beat compared to Bloomberg estimates along with Netflix's own guidance. We also saw earnings per share come in at a beat. They guided to revenue and earnings for the current quarter above Wall Street expectations. And then, I said, earlier, for full year 2025, the company now expects between 44.8 billion to 45.2 billion. That's ahead of its prior forecast of 43.5 billion and 44.5 billion revenue growth, and it does expect revenue from its ads business to roughly double to about 3 billion in 2025. Now, heading into this report, there were lofty expectations. There had been a back and forth debate on Wall Street when it comes to the valuation. It trades at around 40 times forward earnings, about double the S&P 500. Um, but this is just a conversation that analysts have been having, right? How much optimism has been priced into this name at these levels? We are trading above $1,250 a share at the moment. This is a very expensive stock, a very rich stock. There's been some rumblings on Wall Street whether or not we could eventually see a stock split here, but if you take a look to the back half of the year, we have a very strong content slate. We have the return of key tentpole programming like Wednesday, Stranger Things. We just saw season three of Squid Game debut last month. And then on the live content side, they've been doubling down on sports, the NFL, WWE. There's been rumors that they could potentially go after UFC media rights, and there's also reports that they could be partnering with Spotify for a concert series as well. So it just seems to be a lot of upside, particularly on the content, and then of course, on the advertising business as well, which continues to chug along here. Currently, it remains one of the cheapest plans on the market right now. But again, shares are off around 2% in after hours here, Josh.\n\n04:08 Speaker A\n\nAll right.

Major leagues and events, such as the NFL, NHL, Olympics, European Games, EPL and elections, also contribute significantly to ad revenue generation.\n\nShift in Consumer Preference a Key Catalyst : To adapt to the evolving landscape, companies are diversifying their content offerings for over-the-top (OTT) services alongside traditional linear TV. The availability of streaming services across a wide range of platforms has enabled them to reach a global audience, expand their international user base and attract advertisers to their platforms, thereby boosting ad revenues.\n\nWith technological advancements and a growing demand for virtual reality and Internet radio, industry players are increasing their investments in research and development, as well as sales and marketing efforts, to remain competitive. The industry's focus is likely to shift toward sustaining current levels of operations, coupled with a renewed emphasis on flexibility. This approach would accelerate the transition to a variable cost model, thereby reducing fixed costs and enhancing agility in the face of evolving market dynamics.\n\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry encompasses companies that provide entertainment, sports, news, non-fiction, and musical content across television, radio, and digital media platforms. These entities generate revenues through the sale of television and radio programs, advertising slots and subscriptions.\n\nThese companies are thriving due to their diverse content offerings, which include original, regional, and short-form content tailored for small screens like smartphones and tablets. Improved Internet speed and penetration, coupled with technological advancements, have been advantageous for industry participants. As monetization and revenues from advertising spending continue to be modest, strategies focused on profit protection, cash management and greater technology integration have gained significance and are expected to aid these companies in driving top-line growth in the near term.\n\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has been grappling with an escalation in cord-cutting despite a surge in demand for streaming content. However, industry players, such as Netflix , Roku Inc. and Bilibili are reaping the benefits of a massive spike in digital content consumption.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncreased Digital Viewing Fuels Content Demand: Many industry participants, either launching their own OTT services or acquiring existing ones, leverage user insights to deliver tailored content. The surge in digital viewing has made consumer data readily available, allowing companies to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques to create or procure targeted content. This approach not only boosts user engagement but also enables industry players to raise the prices of their services at opportune moments without the fear of losing subscribers.\n\nUncertain Macroeconomic Landscape Impedes Production and Ad Demand: Advertising is a significant revenue source for the Broadcast Radio and Television industry. However, industry participants are grappling with the effects of persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, increased capital costs, a soaring U.S. dollar and the looming threat of a recession.\n\nThese factors have prompted advertisers to trim their ad budgets, which is expected to impact the top-line growth of industry players in the near term. Moreover, intense competition for ad dollars from tech and social media companies has been a significant impediment to the growth of industry participants.\n\nLow-Priced Skinny Bundles Impact Revenues: The surge in cord-cutting has compelled industry participants to offer \"skinny bundles.\" These Internet-based services often contain fewer channels than traditional subscriptions and are, therefore, more affordable.\n\nThis move aligns with changing consumer viewing dynamics, as growth in Internet penetration and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have boosted small-screen viewing. While these alternative services are expected to keep users engaged with their platforms, increasing the need for additional content, the low-priced skinny bundles are likely to dampen the top-line performance of industry players.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #176, which places it in the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential.\n\nDespite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching, as these have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But before we present such stocks, it is worth first looking at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation.\n\nIndustry Beats Sector, S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500 Index in the past year.\n\nThe industry has returned 70.9% over this period compared with the S&P 500's growth of 12.1% and the broader sector's appreciation of 24.3%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of trailing 12-month Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Broadcast Radio and Television stocks, the industry is currently trading at 19.39X versus the S&P 500's 17.71X and the sector's 11.27X.\n\nIn the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.4X and as low as 4.69X, recording a median of 10.36X.\n\n3 Broadcast Radio and Television Stocks to Buy\n\nBilibili: This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company presents compelling investment opportunities, driven by strong operational improvements and strategic positioning. The company's first-quarter 2025 results demonstrated remarkable progress with 24% revenue growth to RMB7 billion, a 99% reduction in GAAP net loss to just RMB11 million, and gross profit margins expanding to 36.3% from 28.3% year over year. Gaming revenues surged 76% while advertising revenues grew 20%, with performance-based ads increasing more than 30%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe platform's user engagement remains robust with 107 million daily active users spending 108 minutes daily, while monthly paying users reached a record 32 million. Bilibili's dominant position among China's Gen Z demographic, combined with successful cost-cutting initiatives and improving profitability metrics, positions the stock favorably for continued growth as the company approaches its long-term margin targets.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has increased 24.6% to $0.71 per share in the past 60 days. BILI shares have gained 31.7% year to date.\n\nNetflix: Based on Netflix's future projections, the streaming giant presents a compelling investment opportunity. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization. Netflix's growth strategy includes expanding its content library, developing live programming options, enhancing its gaming division, and building its advertising business.\n\nThese strategic initiatives are expected to drive significant revenue and profit growth in the coming years. The company is still targeting a 29% operating margin for 2025 based on F/X rates as of Jan. 1, 2025. Netflix demonstrates strong financial discipline alongside growth.\n\nThe ad-supported subscription tier has become a significant success story for Netflix. According to company data, more than 55% of new subscribers in markets where it's available are choosing the ad-supported option. This has led management to project advertising revenues reaching $9 billion annually by 2030, representing an increasing portion of Netflix's total revenues.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has moved north by 0.5% to $25.45 per share in the past 30 days. NFLX shares have returned 41.1% year to date.\n\nRoku: This Zacks Rank #2 company has been strengthening its position in the U.S. ad-supported streaming market by focusing on platform innovation. The Roku Channel became the #2 app on its platform by engagement in the United States in the first quarter of 2025, driven by improvements to the AI-powered content row that has been boosting viewer engagement, ad reach and subscriptions.\n\nThe Home Screen has been reaching more than 125 million people daily, serving as a key launch point for advertisers. Roku's ad partnerships and shoppable formats have been unlocking new monetization avenues. A recent deal with Amazon Ads expanded reach to an estimated 80 million CTV homes. Roku has been investing in new ad products and measurement tools, expected to roll out in the second half of 2025.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has remained steady at a loss of 18 cents per share in the past 60 days. In the year-to-date period, ROKU shares have gained 22.3%.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren't winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nFree: See Our Top Stock And 4 Runners Up\n\nJoin us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\n\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

For more, we're bringing in here Yahoo Finance senior reporter, Allie Canal. Allie.\n\n00:10 Allie Canal\n\nHey, Josh. Well, expectations are high, of course, especially for Netflix. I'm taking a look at shares behind me. Year to date, we are up a whopping 40%. We are trading at evaluation double the benchmark S&P 500. So that's the big focus here heading into this earnings report. There are some analysts on Wall Street who say maybe all that optimism has been priced into this stock. JP Morgan, for example, has a neutral rating on shares. They have a price target of 1200 bucks, so they see a bit of deceleration. But others say this valuation is justified, that if you look at all the tech opportunities out there, Netflix is one of those high-growth stocks that over the next two to three years are going to continue to outperform. Now, as a reminder, the company no longer reports subscriber figures. So the focus here is going to be on the advertising business as well as a strong content slate. We have the return of those big tentpole shows like Stranger Things, Wednesday. We recently saw the return of Squid Game at the end of last month. So that's been an exciting moment for this company as it gears up for the back half of the year. There's also talk that Netflix could be bidding on UFC media rights. They've had a lot of success with WWE. So that's been a rumor that's been circulating around Hollywood. So we'll see if we have any more clarity on that on the earnings call. But all things considered, this is a strong company, lots of momentum, and really the start of big tech earnings season. We've seen a strong start to earnings season right now with the banks. We'll see if Netflix can deliver tomorrow.\n\n02:53 Speaker A\n\nAnd Allie, here's another question I have for you. The UFC, which analysts are writing about, you know, when they're previews their research notes. They're saying maybe there could be some smoke here.\n\n03:22 Allie Canal\n\nYeah, and Dana White, he sits on the board of the UFC, and he said that this is a company that's looking to maybe go more global. So the immediate streamers that come to mind is Netflix, Amazon. Both of those companies have dabbled in sports in the past, but I think the fact that Netflix has gone so far into WWE and has seen a lot of that success bodes well for the possibility that they could bid on UFC. Now, UFC currently airs on ESPN, so this would be a switch up, uh, taking it away from Disney. So sports in general seems to be the general direction that Netflix is heading in. They want these live event moments, these big tentpole moments. They're also experimenting with other types of live content, a potential partnership with Spotify for concert series. We saw them air a few NFL games as well. So this wouldn't be a deviation from their strategy, and certainly, when there's smoke, sometimes there's fire. So again, Josh, I think we're going to hear this on the call, and we'll see what those executives have to say.\n\n04:56 Speaker A\n\nYeah, Dana White saying more than likely we're going to end up with a platform that is way more global than we are now. We shall see. Allie, thank you.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:49:45.928711+00:00"}

NFLX is set to report second-quarter earnings on Thursday, after market close. Will the results boost the stock price, and is it a good time to buy? Let’s dive in.\n\nWhat Will Happen to Netflix Shares After Q2 Earnings?\n\nNetflix’s $10.5 billion revenues in the first quarter marked a 13% increase from the same period last year. Its earnings per share (EPS) reached $6.61, a 25% rise year over year. These results followed the company’s strong revenue and EPS growth in the fourth quarter, which exceeded investor expectations.\n\nNetflix anticipates that this positive trend will continue into the second quarter. The streaming giant predicts revenues of $11.04 billion, a 15.4% increase from the previous year. Its projected EPS is $7.03, up 44.1% from last year. Additionally, the company projects operating margins to rise from 27.2% in the second quarter of 2024 to 33.3%.\n\nFurthermore, Netflix’s trailing four-quarter earnings surprise averages a positive 6.9%, suggesting the company could deliver second-quarter growth that might boost its stock price.

This high valuation suggests Netflix’s potential for post-earnings growth is limited, as Wall Street already expects the company to beat second-quarter estimates. If the company fails to meet or exceed projections, investors should prepare for a potential sell-off.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow to Trade Netflix Stock Now?\n\nInvestors looking for quick profits following the surge in Netflix’s stock price after its earnings report are facing significant risks. Predicting share price fluctuations after earnings releases is challenging, but the long-term outlook for Netflix appears positive.\n\nDue to shifts in business dynamics and intense competition, Netflix launched a low-cost, ad-supported tier. The move turned out to be successful since this tier now makes up nearly half of Netflix’s signups and has enabled the company to sell ad slots to advertisers. Netflix’s ad revenues rose last year and are expected to double by 2025.\n\nNetflix believes that there is a $650 billion revenue growth opportunity in the streaming industry. Being a leader in the streaming industry, Netflix is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth with its top-notch content. Last December, Netflix's NFL Christmas Day games attracted many viewers. This year, NFL games will again be streamed and are expected to attract a large audience. Additional events like SummerSlam, WrestleMania and boxing matches featuring Canelo Alvarez versus Terence Crawford will also draw viewers, enhancing the company’s revenue.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:49:52.403618+00:00"}

The company's strong content slate and strategic platform enhancements throughout the second quarter is likely to have contributed to continued subscriber growth and engagement gains.\n\n\n\nThe quarter benefited from a compelling mix of high-profile content releases that drove significant viewer interest. Netflix's film lineup included major productions featuring A-list talent, with Nonnas starring Vince Vaughn, Tyler Perry's drama Straw featuring Taraji P. Henson, and the action thriller Havoc starring Tom Hardy and Forest Whitaker. These premium offerings are likely to have attracted new subscribers while retaining existing ones during the competitive summer viewing season.\n\n\n\nMore significantly, Netflix released the highly anticipated third and final season of Squid Game on June 27, which has historically been their most popular series globally. This cultural phenomenon is expected to have generated substantial subscriber additions and engagement spikes, particularly in international markets. The quarter also saw the return of beloved franchises, including new seasons of Black Mirror and Ginny & Georgia, along with fresh content like The Four Seasons starring comedy powerhouses Tina Fey and Steve Carell.\n\n\n\nNetflix's advertising business momentum continued accelerating through the second quarter, with the company successfully expanding its proprietary Netflix Ads Suite platform across EMEA markets and achieving full rollout across all 12 ad-supported countries by June. This expansion is likely to have contributed meaningful incremental revenue growth, supporting management's guidance for roughly doubling advertising revenues in 2025.\n\n\n\nThe company's strategic investments in platform enhancement are noteworthy. Netflix introduced improved user experience features, including AI-powered search capabilities, enhanced recommendation systems, and a redesigned homepage, which are expected to have boosted engagement metrics and reduced churn rates. These technological improvements position Netflix advantageously against competitors while improving monetization efficiency.\n\n\n\nManagement's confidence remained evident through its $1 billion commitment to transform Fort Monmouth into a premier East Coast production hub, signaling long-term growth conviction. Combined with the company's expanding global content pipeline and successful pricing strategies, Netflix appears to have multiple growth drivers firing simultaneously.\n\n\n\nDespite growing competition from the likes of Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Disney DIS, a compelling second-quarter content slate anchored by Squid Game's finale, accelerating advertising platform rollout, and continued platform innovations makes Netflix poised to meet or exceed its second-quarter guidance of 33% operating margins. Investors should consider positioning ahead of what appears to be another quarter of solid execution and growth acceleration.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:49:54.386336+00:00"}

The bank’s price target of $1,490 is among the most bullish on Wall Street and represents a premium of 18% over Netflix’s intraday price Wednesday. Shares of Netflix are up more than 40% so far in 2025.\n\nWedbush analysts, which maintained a $1,400 target this week, said Netflix is poised to grow revenue from its ad-supported subscription tier by incorporating more live events and expanding its ad partnerships. The streamer raised the price of its ad tier to $7.99 from $6.99 in January, while the cost of its standard ad-free plan rose to $17.99 from $15.49, and its premium plan moved to $24.99 from $22.99.\n\n“While massive subscriber growth was the primary driver in 2024, we expect price increases to drive revenue growth in 2025, and the ad tier to drive revenue higher in 2026,” Wedbush said.\n\nThe consensus price target among analysts in Visible Alpha’s database is $1,330, implying roughly 6% upside over Netflix’s current price.

The availability of streaming services across a wide range of platforms has enabled them to reach a global audience, expand their international user base and attract advertisers to their platforms, thereby boosting ad revenues. The utilization of services that aid advertisers in measuring their return on investment and enhancing use cases is expected to benefit industry participants. Major leagues and events, such as the NFL, NHL, Olympics, European Games, EPL and elections, also contribute significantly to ad revenue generation.\n\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry encompasses companies that provide entertainment, sports, news, non-fiction, and musical content across television, radio, and digital media platforms. These entities generate revenues through the sale of television and radio programs, advertising slots and subscriptions. With technological advancements and a growing demand for virtual reality and Internet radio, industry players are increasing their investments in research and development, as well as sales and marketing efforts, to remain competitive. The industry's focus is likely to shift toward sustaining current levels of operations, coupled with a renewed emphasis on flexibility. This approach would accelerate the transition to a variable cost model, thereby reducing fixed costs and enhancing agility in the face of evolving market dynamics.\n\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has been grappling with an escalation in cord-cutting despite a surge in demand for streaming content. However, industry players, such as Netflix NFLX, Roku Inc. ROKU and Bilibili BILI, are reaping the benefits of a massive spike in digital content consumption. These companies are thriving due to their diverse content offerings, which include original, regional, and short-form content tailored for small screens like smartphones and tablets. Improved Internet speed and penetration, coupled with technological advancements, have been advantageous for industry participants. As monetization and revenues from advertising spending continue to be modest, strategies focused on profit protection, cash management and greater technology integration have gained significance and are expected to aid these companies in driving top-line growth in the near term.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIncreased Digital Viewing Fuels Content Demand: Many industry participants, either launching their own OTT services or acquiring existing ones, leverage user insights to deliver tailored content. The surge in digital viewing has made consumer data readily available, allowing companies to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques to create or procure targeted content. This approach not only boosts user engagement but also enables industry players to raise the prices of their services at opportune moments without the fear of losing subscribers.\n\nUncertain Macroeconomic Landscape Impedes Production and Ad Demand: Advertising is a significant revenue source for the Broadcast Radio and Television industry. However, industry participants are grappling with the effects of persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, increased capital costs, a soaring U.S. dollar and the looming threat of a recession. These factors have prompted advertisers to trim their ad budgets, which is expected to impact the top-line growth of industry players in the near term. Moreover, intense competition for ad dollars from tech and social media companies has been a significant impediment to the growth of industry participants.\n\nLow-Priced Skinny Bundles Impact Revenues: The surge in cord-cutting has compelled industry participants to offer \"skinny bundles.\" These Internet-based services often contain fewer channels than traditional subscriptions and are, therefore, more affordable. This move aligns with changing consumer viewing dynamics, as growth in Internet penetration and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have boosted small-screen viewing. While these alternative services are expected to keep users engaged with their platforms, increasing the need for additional content, the low-priced skinny bundles are likely to dampen the top-line performance of industry players.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #176, which places it in the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\n\n\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\n\n\nThe industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential.\n\n\n\nDespite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching, as these have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But before we present such stocks, it is worth first looking at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation.\n\nIndustry Beats Sector, S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500 Index in the past year.\n\n\n\nThe industry has returned 70.9% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s growth of 12.1% and the broader sector’s appreciation of 24.3%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of trailing 12-month Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Broadcast Radio and Television stocks, the industry is currently trading at 19.39X versus the S&P 500’s 17.71X and the sector’s 11.27X.\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.4X and as low as 4.69X, recording a median of 10.36X, as the chart below shows.\n\nEV/EBITDA Ratio (TTM)\n\n3 Broadcast Radio and Television Stocks to Buy\n\nBilibili: This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company presents compelling investment opportunities, driven by strong operational improvements and strategic positioning.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix NFLX.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nNetflix Earnings Loom: Can Momentum Sustain?\n\nEarnings season is just a few days away from shifting into a much higher gear following the big banks' results on Friday, but the reality remains that the Q2 earnings cycle has already begun, with several companies already delivering their results. We count these results as part of our broader Q2 tally.\n\nAnd on the docket this week is none other than entertainment giant Netflix, whose scorching-hot share performance has seemingly been overlooked amid the AI frenzy. Up 90% over the last year, the stock has outperformed not just the broader market but each of the Mag 7 members overall, a reflection of its resiliency.\n\nLet's take a closer look at expectations for the entertainment favorite.\n\nNetflix Remains Resilient\n\nStrong quarterly results have led to NFLX's surge over the past year, with the reaffirmation of FY25 guidance in its latest print going a long way in alleviating investors.\n\nAnalysts have been bullish concerning the upcoming print, with the current $7.05 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 13% over the last several months and suggesting 44% growth year-over-year.\n\nWhile no upward revisions have hit the tape over the last several weeks, the stability here is the greater takeaway, particularly so amid the economically sensitive environment we've found ourselves in.\n\nSales expectations have largely followed the same path, with the $11.0 billion in sales expected suggesting a 15% climb year-over-year.\n\nContinued subscriber growth has overall been the main positive driving force for Netflix, with the company losing subscribers (on a YoY basis) just once over its last 12 quarters. The ad-supported tiers were a big surprise given Netflix's popularity for being ad-free, but the success of the implementation has opened an avenue for growth through digital advertising.\n\nA big crackdown on password sharing has also unlocked many obvious benefits as the company looks to capture revenue from viewers who were sharing subscriptions.\n\nThe company's efficiency over recent years has also been a huge tailwind, with the company's margins expanding nicely.\n\nIt's worth noting that shares are heading into the print demanding a hefty premium, unsurprising given its recent high-growth nature. The current forward 12-month earnings multiple works out to 43.9X, well above the 33.8X five-year median and reflecting a steep 94% premium relative to the S&P 500.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:50:08.444200+00:00"}

Shares are 40% higher year-to-date, and about 6% below the late-June all-time high of $1,341.15. The rally follows management's guidance for a 33% operating-margin quarter and growing confidence in the ad business.\n\nWith Netflix no longer issuing quarterly paid-membership or ARM data, investors will key on engagement and churn commentary. The advertising tier hit 94 million users in May and accounted for 55% of new sign-ups, shifting focus to viewing time and cohort retention. Management's forthcoming bi-annual engagement report and any color on churn after last autumn's price increases will be closely watched.\n\nCash generation is another swing factor. Netflix continues to project about $8 billion in 2025 free cash flow even after committing $5 billion over a ten-year deal to stream WWE's Raw from January 2025. Evidence that higher sports costs can coexist with disciplined spending will determine whether the stock's premium multiple endures.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:50:10.300820+00:00"}

Scheduled to report the period's results after market close on Thursday, investors will be hoping the financials live up to the stock's pricey valuation after its big move higher this year. Shares have soared 42% in 2025 alone -- and that's on top of an 83% gain last year. In total, the stock has risen an incredible 160% since the beginning of 2024.\n\nOf course, shares of Netflix have risen for good reason. The underlying business is firing on all cylinders. However, the stock's significant gains mean there's no room for error. So, here's what investors should know ahead of the streaming service specialist's earnings report this week. More importantly, we'll examine whether the stock appears to be an attractive investment at its current price.\n\nA handful of catalysts\n\nOne of the primary reasons Netflix has performed so well this year is that the stock has not just one but a handful of catalysts likely to drive strong growth for the company for the foreseeable future.\n\nStarting with the company's nascent advertising business, management stated in its first-quarter update that advertising revenue is expected to roughly double this year. Of course, this business is still small relative to the company's overall business but management's optimism for this high-margin revenue stream is good news for shareholders.\n\nAnother major catalyst for the company (and shares) is Netflix's rapidly expanding operating margin. In the first quarter of 2025, for instance, it was 31.7% -- up from 28.1% in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, management is guiding for a full-year operating margin of 29%. This is up from 27% in 2024. The combination of double-digit revenue growth and operating expansion margin means earnings per share is growing particularly fast. To this end, Netflix's first-quarter earnings per share increased by more than 25% year over year, outpacing its 12.5% revenue growth during the period.\n\nFinally, there's the catalyst of steady price increases. For years, Netflix has been able to repeatedly roll out price incresaes for its subscription plans, and customers have remained loyal. In fact, we'll see the benefit of some of the company's most recent increases when Netflix reports earnings this week. Management noted in its first-quarter letter to shareholders that it would benefit from a full quarter of year-over-year price increases during Q2.\n\nOf course, Netflix's growth drivers don't end here. There's the company's foray into live events and gaming, as well as a continued crackdown on password sharing, too. All of these catalysts should help fuel double-digit revenue growth for years to come.\n\nShares aren't as expensive as they look\n\nGiven all of these significant catalysts, it's evident that the streaming service specialist stock deserves a premium valuation. But is its current price-to-earnings multiple of about 60 simply too high?\n\nTo determine whether shares are attractive today, consider how the company's growth drivers are reflected in Netflix's financials.\n\nStarting with Netflix's top-line story, note that management said in its first-quarter update that it actually expected its revenue growth rate to be higher in Q2 than it was in Q1. Specifically, management guided for second-quarter revenue to rise at a rate of 15.4% year over year. This is up from 12.5% growth in the first quarter of 2025. Additionally, management guided for a spectacular operating margin of 33.3%, up from 27.2% in the year-ago period and 31.7% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nPutting the company's momentum into perspective, if Netflix delivers on its guidance for Q1, it will report earnings per share of $7.03, up 44% year over year. While shareholders obviously shouldn't expect bottom-line growth like this every quarter, guidance like this does help justify the stock's sky-high valuation.\n\nOverall, I believe shares are a hold at their current price. The company's broad array of catalysts should help the company grow into its valuation. Of course, there's always a risk that the company's growth will slow more than expected. But given how many tailwinds the business is benefiting from, shares are probably worth holding for the long haul -- even at their current price.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:50:12.578535+00:00"}

With second-quarter earnings around the corner on July 17, some of the most respected analysts on Wall Street are raising their price targets and doubling down on their bullish bets.\n\nLet's start with the numbers. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of $7.07, a big jump from last year's $4.88, and revenue around $11.4 billion. Not bad for a company that already saw its stock soar over 40% this year.\n\nKeyBanc's Justin Patterson just raised his price target to $1,390, pointing to Netflix's growing ad revenue, higher subscription prices, and push into live programming. He's optimistic, even with some hit shows wrapping up. Needham's Laura Martin is even more bullishshe lifted her target to $1,500, highlighting Netflix's off-the-charts employee productivity. According to her, they're pulling in nearly double the revenue per employee compared to other tech giants.\n\nAnd then there's Alicia Reese from Wedbush, who still sees untapped potential in Netflix's ad tier. She believes live events and better targeting tools could make ads a major growth engine by 2026. Her price target? $1,400.\n\nOf course, with a rally this strong, there's always the chance Netflix might cool offat least until its next big content win. But with 27 analysts rating it a Buy and price targets creeping higher, the message is clear: Wall Street still believes in the Netflix story.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:50:18.527854+00:00"}

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Netflix (NFLX) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this internet video service is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Netflix is 23.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -4.2%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Netflix is 21.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -25.3%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 16.8% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 4.2%.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T10:50:22.625567+00:00"}

The company reported 13% revenue growth to $10.54 billion, with operating income surging 27% year over year, demonstrating strong operational leverage. The company has set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization. Netflix’s growth strategy includes expanding its content library, developing live programming options, enhancing its gaming division, and building its advertising business. The company's advertising tier has emerged as a significant growth driver, with management projecting advertising revenues to double in 2025. The recent launch of Netflix's proprietary Ad Suite in the United States marks a crucial step toward monetization independence and enhanced targeting capabilities. Over 55% of new subscribers in ad-supported markets are choosing this option, indicating strong consumer acceptance of the value proposition. Content remains Netflix's core strength, with a robust slate including live events, original series, and films across multiple genres and languages. The company's investment in local content production across 50 countries creates a sustainable competitive advantage while building cultural relevance in key markets. Recent successes like WWE programming and upcoming boxing matches demonstrate Netflix's ability to expand beyond traditional streaming content. Looking ahead, Netflix's guidance projects 15.4% revenue growth for the second quarter, with operating margins expected to improve to 33%. The company maintains its full-year revenue guidance of $43.5-$44.5 billion while targeting $8 billion in free cash flow, reflecting strong cash generation capabilities that support continued content investment and shareholder returns. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.42 per share, indicating 28.19% growth year over year.\n\nThe streaming landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with Netflix NFLX and Warner Bros. Discovery WBD representing two distinct approaches to entertainment distribution. Netflix has established itself as the global streaming leader with more than 700 million viewers worldwide, while Warner Bros. Discovery combines traditional media assets with streaming ambitions through its Max platform and extensive content library. Both companies face similar challenges in an increasingly competitive market, including content costs, subscriber acquisition, and the need to balance growth with profitability. Their recent quarterly results and strategic announcements provide valuable insights into their respective trajectories and investment potential. Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nNetflix, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nNetflix, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nNetflix, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Netflix, Inc. Quote\n\nFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nThe Case for WBD Stock\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery faces a more complex strategic landscape as it navigates the separation into two distinct entities, namely Streaming & Studios and Global Linear Networks. This restructuring, expected to complete by mid-2026, aims to unlock shareholder value by allowing each business to focus on its core strengths and pursue targeted growth strategies.\n\n\n\nThe company's streaming segment, centered around Max, showed resilience with 122.3 million subscribers and positive momentum in content performance. Recent successes include popular series and strong international expansion, with Max now available in 77 markets. The platform benefits from HBO's premium content reputation and Warner Bros. Discovery's extensive film library, providing a differentiated value proposition.\n\n\n\nHowever, WBD's financial profile presents challenges. First-quarter revenues declined 10% to $9 billion, reflecting ongoing pressures in traditional linear television and the company's transition to streaming-first operations. The company carries a significant debt burden of $38 billion, though management has been actively reducing leverage through debt repayments and refinancing activities.\n\n\n\nThe planned separation strategy could create value by allowing the streaming business to operate with greater flexibility while the linear networks business focuses on cash generation. Global Linear Networks continues to generate substantial cash flow, providing financial stability during the transition period. The combined entity's vast content library and production capabilities across multiple studios represent long-term assets that could drive future growth.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at a loss of 4 cents per share, narrower than loss of $4.62 per share reported in the year-ago period.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. Quote\n\nValuation and Price Performance\n\nNetflix trades at a significant premium with a forward price-to-sales ratio of 11.33x, reflecting investor confidence in its growth trajectory and streaming dominance. In contrast, WBD trades at a discounted 0.77x forward price-to-sales ratio, indicating market skepticism about its restructuring strategy and debt burden. This valuation gap underscores different investor perceptions of each company's future prospects.\n\nNFLX vs. WBD: P/S F12M Ratio\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNetflix's superior stock performance reinforces this sentiment, with shares surging 41.6% year to date compared with WBD's more modest 13.6% gain and the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s 10.2% rise. The premium valuation for Netflix appears justified given its consistent execution, while WBD's discounted multiple reflects ongoing transformation risks and financial complexities.\n\nNFLX Outperforms WBD in YTD\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nNetflix demonstrates superior fundamental strength through consistent revenue growth, expanding margins, and strong cash generation capabilities. The company's global streaming leadership, successful advertising tier launch, and robust content pipeline position it for continued outperformance. WBD's strategic restructuring, while potentially value-creating, introduces execution risks and timeline uncertainties that may limit near-term upside. Netflix's clearer path to profitability growth, combined with its proven ability to adapt to market changes, makes it a more attractive investment opportunity. Investors should buy Netflix stock to capitalize on its streaming dominance and improving financial metrics, while holding or waiting for better entry points on WBD until the separation strategy shows clearer progress. NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas WBD has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Below is a chart illustrating the EPS revisions for NFLX’s upcoming release.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nContinued subscriber growth has overall been the main positive driving force for Netflix, with the company losing subscribers (on a YoY basis) just once over its last 12 quarters.

An ABR of 1.72 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 27 are Strong Buy and three are Buy.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.

In the first quarter, the streaming leader generated revenue of $10.5 billion, up 13% year over year, resulting in earnings per share (EPS) of $6.61, an increase of 25%. This was fueled by Netflix's expanding operating margin, which climbed to 31.7%, up 360 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter. These results came on the heels of 16% revenue growth and 102% EPS growth in Q4. In both quarters, results easily outpaced investor expectations.\n\nHowever, it was the company's plans for the future that helped fuel the stock's blistering run.
