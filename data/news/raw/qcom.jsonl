In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 11 days ago when the stock dropped 3.9% on the news that the U.S. jobs report for July came in significantly weaker than expected while new widespread import tariffs were announced, sparking fears of a potential economic slowdown. The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs, far below estimates, and massive downward revisions to the prior two months painted a much weaker picture of the labor market. This has stoked recession fears, which would directly impact demand for chips used in countless products. Compounding these worries, the White House announced new tariffs, including a 20% levy on imports from Taiwan, a global hub for chip manufacturing. This dual shock of slowing domestic growth and renewed trade friction creates a challenging outlook for the highly cyclical and globally connected semiconductor industry, leading to a broad-based sell-off.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:10:06.673299+00:00"}

The company is well-positioned to meet its long-term revenue targets driven by solid 5G traction, greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream. In addition, the chip manufacturer envisions solid growth opportunities within the mobile space, driven by the strength of its Snapdragon portfolio. Leveraging processors with multi-core CPUs with cutting-edge features, amazing graphics and worldwide network connectivity, Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile platforms are fast with superb power efficiency. Smartphones and mobile devices built with Snapdragon mobile platforms enable immersive augmented reality and virtual reality experiences, brilliant camera capabilities, superior 4G LTE and 5G connectivity with state-of-the-art security solutions. Qualcomm is currently foraying deeper into the realm of AI capabilities within the laptop and desktop business with the launch of the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI desktops and laptops. The Snapdragon X SoC (system-on-chip) is the fourth such product in the Snapdragon X processor line, following the successful launch of the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core, Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite series. Based on a 4-nanometer process, the Snapdragon X chip comprises an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU accelerates AI workloads, offering 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), making it an ideal platform to power Copilot+PCs – Microsoft Corporation ’s MSFT vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware.\n\nQualcomm Incorporated QCOM reported relatively robust third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, with adjusted earnings exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by healthy demand trends in IoT and automotive businesses. The automotive telematics and connectivity platforms, digital cockpit and C-V2X solutions are fueling emerging automotive industry trends such as the growth of connected vehicles, the transformation of the in-car experience and vehicle electrification. Qualcomm believes it is on track to achieve a combined $22 billion in revenues from automotive and IoT by fiscal 2029. Automotive revenues rose 21% to a record high of $984 million, driven by increased content in new-vehicle launches with the Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform as automakers continue to deploy high-performance, low-power computing and connectivity chips to bring next-generation experience to consumers. IoT revenues were up 24% to $1.68 billion on solid demand for the Snapdragon AR1 chipset for the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) smart glasses category. In fiscal 2025, Qualcomm expects IoT and automotive revenues to grow approximately 20% and 35%, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBitter Trade Relations With China Hurt QCOM\n\nDespite the healthy growth dynamics, Qualcomm is increasingly finding it difficult to maintain its operations in China. The chip-making firm has a significant presence in more than 12 cities in China and has been a key supplier of chips and other related components to local smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi, Huawei and its spin-off brand Honor. Much of these hardships can be attributed to the continued U.S.-China trade spat. The U.S. Commerce Department has long imposed various trade restrictions against China that ban the sale of high-tech equipment, chips, components and related technology to develop high-end smartphones and AI-enabled chips. With Trump imposing fresh levies on China in his second term in office, Beijing has also put reciprocal tariffs in place as a ‘tit-for-tat’ measure, adversely impacting Qualcomm’s revenues. With the high-stakes tariff truce extension hanging in the balance, the company is finding it difficult to maintain its growth in China.\n\nHigh R&D Costs Dent QCOM Margins\n\nOver the years, Qualcomm's margins have declined due to high operating expenses and R&D (research & development) costs. The company expects softness in the handset market and a weaker overall mix of devices to continue in the near future. Shift in the share among original equipment manufacturers at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from the Snapdragon platform. Aggressive competition from low-cost chip manufacturers and established players in the mobile phone chipset market is also likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum over the next three to four years, a major portion of this growth is likely to come from the low-cost emerging markets, which may weigh on Qualcomm's margins.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPrice Performance\n\nQCOM shares have declined 9.4% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 51.5%, lagging peers like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HPE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO. While Hewlett Packard gained 21.1%, Broadcom surged 105.2% during this period.\n\nOne-Year QCOM Stock Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimate Revision Trend for QCOM\n\nEarnings estimates for Qualcomm for fiscal 2025 have moved up 7.9% to $11.85 over the past year, while the same for fiscal 2026 has declined 2.7% to $11.86. The mixed bag of estimate revisions depicts that investors are skeptical about the growth prospects of the stock.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEnd Note\n\nWith robust automotive and Snapdragon traction, Qualcomm appears to be relatively better placed in terms of its portfolio strength. A strong emphasis on quality, diligent execution of operational plans and continuous portfolio enhancements are driving more value for customers.\n\n\n\nHowever, stiff competition and softness in key end markets are likely to put pressure on the bottom-line growth. High R&D costs eroded its profitability to a large extent. Qualcomm is reportedly undertaking job cuts and retrenchments to sustain its business in China amid escalating tariffs, raising questions about its long-term viability plans in the communist country. The mixed earnings estimate revisions also put a question mark on the company’s growth prospects. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Qualcomm appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Nice (NICE) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.02 a share, just six days from its upcoming earnings release on August 14, 2025.\n\nNICE has an Earnings ESP figure of +0.88%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.02 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.99.\n\nNICE is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Qualcomm (QCOM) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nQualcomm, which is readying to report earnings on November 5, 2025, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. Its Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.86 a share, and QCOM is 89 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nQualcomm's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at +1.00% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.83.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NICE and QCOM could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

But if we dig just a bit deeper, we'll uncover three cheap tech stocks that are still worth buying today: Verizon (VZ 0.10%), Qualcomm (QCOM 3.89%), and United Microelectronics (UMC 1.26%).\n\n1. Verizon\n\nVerizon, one of America's top telecom companies, is often considered a reliable long-term income investment. But over the past five years, its stock declined more than 25% as it struggled to gain new wireless and business wireline subscribers.\n\nTo offset that pressure, it's aggressively expanding its broadband business with its fixed wireless access (FWA) and FiOS fiber networks. Its planned acquisition of Frontier Communications, which is expected to close in 2026, will accelerate that strategy by adding at least 2.2 million new fiber subscribers.\n\nIt also aims to leverage the strength of its broadband business to launch more wireless and entertainment bundles, which could stabilize its weaker wireless segment and increase the stickiness of its services. In addition, its new services, which integrate its 5G networks with a wider range of artificial intelligence (AI) services, could bring back more enterprise customers and reduce the importance of its business wireline division.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Verizon's revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2% and 3%, respectively. Its stock trades at just 6 times this year's adjusted EBITDA, and its hefty forward dividend yield of 6.3% is supported by a low payout ratio of 63%. That stable growth, low valuation, and high yield should make it a great stock to buy and hold, even if the broader market swoons.\n\n2. Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm is one of the world's leading producers of system on chips (SoCs) -- which bundle together a central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), and modem -- for smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. It also produces chips for connected cars and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It generates most of its revenue from its SoCs, but most of its profits come from its licensing business, which leverages its wireless patents to earn royalties and licensing fees from every smartphone sold worldwide -- even if they don't use its chips.\n\nQualcomm's sales growth usually mirrors the smartphone market's boom and bust cycles. It suffered a severe slowdown in fiscal 2023 (which ended in September 2023) as the 5G upgrade cycle cooled. But in fiscal 2024, its revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 9% and 21%, respectively, as the smartphone market stabilized and it launched new chips for processing AI applications.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and EPS to both grow at a CAGR of 6%. That growth should be driven by its sales of newer chips for the auto, IoT, edge networking, and PC markets, and that diversification should reduce its dependence on smartphones and offset its eventual loss of Apple, which plans to replace Qualcomm's 5G modems with its own chips within the next two years.\n\nQualcomm certainly isn't a high-growth stock anymore, but it looks like a bargain at 12 times its forward adjusted earnings. Its forward yield of 2.4% is also buoyed by a low payout ratio of 33%.\n\n3. UMC\n\nUnited Microelectronics, more commonly known as UMC, is Taiwan's second-largest contract chipmaker after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 0.77%), or TSMC. But unlike TSMC, which manufactures the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips, UMC only produces larger, older, and cheaper chips for the lower-end and mid-range device markets.\n\nUMC is growing at a slower rate than TSMC, but it's still a linchpin of the semiconductor market. It will continue to scale up its production of chips for its mature nodes (28 nanometers to 90 nanometers), which are still widely used to manufacture analog, power integrated circuits (ICs), microcontrollers, display drivers, and IoT chips. The growth of the auto market could generate tailwinds for all those markets.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect UMC's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 5% and 2%, respectively. Those growth rates might not seem too impressive, but the stock looks cheap at 14 times this year's earnings. Its dividend fluctuates every year based on its earnings growth, but its high forward yield of 7.1% should limit its downside potential. That makes it an attractive value play on the secular expansion of the global semiconductor market.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:10:16.401996+00:00"}

The president also saying yesterday that they'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors but then saying that if you're building in the US, or planning to build in the US, then maybe you're exempt. How do you make sense of, of that language? What, what are you getting at?\n\n00:37 Speaker B\n\nYeah, it's, it is, it is tough. So like, you know, he made some comments yesterday and that's what we have to go on. Um, you know, this is all part of what's, what was called a 232 investigation, um, in, into semiconductors and, and other things. And we actually haven't seen the report from the 232 investigators. So once we see that, I think we can start to be a little more, you know, prescriptive about what the actual impacts are, will be. Like right now, we're just trying to decipher his comments and, and, look, this is Trump, you know, he makes comments all the time and sometimes they lack detail and, and nuance, right? Um, and so we, we, we don't actually know like what it means. Um, you know, what he did say, you're right, he said there's going to be a hundred percent tariffs on semis, but if you're building here in the US then you'll be exempt. And there's a bunch of stuff in, but there's questions, what does building in the US mean? How much do you have to build? Like what's the timeframe? You know, is it, is it, is he talking about semiconductors? Is he talking about the end devices? Will there be tariffs on just raw semiconductors coming into the US, which is actually not that much? We don't import that much. Or is it tariffs on semiconductors in devices? You know, can customers still use, you know, TSMC manufacturing capacity in Taiwan with no tariff because TSMC is building a lot in the US? Like, I, I don't know. I don't know exactly how to, to parse this yet. Um, we will have to wait until we, we, we see, uh, the actual report. I think though, the reason the stocks are up is it does look like there, there will be some loopholes or some reprieves from this, the blind hundred percent tariffs. And, you know, there are semiconductor companies and other, like tech companies that are investing a lot in the US and trying to build here. And so I think there's a perception, which hopefully it's, at least there's some, some truth to it that, um, there will be some reprieve from this. We, we won't know for sure, we won't be able to really, um, be specific about it until we actually see what is, what is going on, uh, when they actually file the, the regulations.\n\n04:04 Speaker A\n\nAnd, so, I, I know this then makes the, the final question sort of hard to answer, right? But as an investor in the space, is there a winner or loser from sort of what we've just laid out or who's kind of best positioned then given that?\n\n04:25 Speaker B\n\nI mean, like the knee jerk reaction, you, you'll say, look, companies, at least on the semiconductor side, companies that are actually actively building here, presumably would be, you know, perceived as, as relative winners. I mean, you've got companies like Texas Instruments, for example, who are building a significant amount of capacity in the US. That is their plan and they've been delivering on it and, and there's more to come. You have companies like, like Nvidia. Like Nvidia doesn't build chips, like they're, they're fabless, they outsource manufacturing, but they're investing a lot of money in the AI supply chain, at least they're giving headlines so you, you have that. Um, I mean, you've got fabless companies like, like AMD or, or, or Qualcomm or whatever that actually can use in, in, at TSMC in Arizona. And, you know, there is a read of the comments that suggests maybe they could continue to use the Taiwan stuff tariff free, like, we, we don't know yet, but like, maybe. Um, you've got the semi caps. Like again, if we have to build more capacity here in the US at the margin, that's probably incrementally positive for the US semi cap players. Um, so those are the kinds of like knee jerk reactions that I mean in some sense are probably going on today. Um, and again, we'll know more like when we get more specifics.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:10:18.484030+00:00"}

More than 100 of those investments were made in China, including deals with once-obscure startups such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. — today China’s largest chipmaker — where he served on the board for a decade and a half.\n\nIn recent years, as US-China tensions escalated, Washington increasingly restricted Beijing’s access to advanced technology and placed tighter limits on the ability of US companies to do business there. And Tan’s efforts to distance himself from Chinese investments accelerated with his appointment at Intel Corp. (INTC) in March, when he agreed to divest his holdings there, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped US lawmakers — and, now, Donald Trump — from holding Tan’s past Chinese affiliations against him. The US president called the executive “highly conflicted” in a social media post and urged him to resign.\n\nIntel has said Tan and the board are “deeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests.” Late on Thursday, Tan said he’s got the full backing of the company’s board, responding for the first time to Trump. “We are engaging with the Administration to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts,” he said in a letter to staff posted on Intel’s website.\n\nHere’s what we know about Tan’s business dealings in China.\n\nWalden\n\nHe started work at a venture capital firm in the 1980s called Walden Ventures, where he helped create a spinoff named Walden International that focused on overseas opportunities.\n\nTan, a Mandarin speaker born in Malaysia, helped the company make investments all over East Asia, including China.

Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 2%, while Micron (MU) stocks edged up 0.7%.\n\nMost of the world's advanced chips are produced by leading contract chip manufacturer TSMC (TSM) in Taiwan, but the company has been building out its capacity in Arizona with a $165 billion investment, exempting it from Trump's tariffs. The company's US-listed shares jumped nearly 5% Thursday.\n\nTech companies have rushed to announce investments in their US manufacturing footprint in the hopes of avoiding Trump’s trade war wrath. So far, Nvidia has committed to producing $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the US. Micron made a similar $200 billion commitment. Texas Instruments (TXN) has said it’s spending $60 billion to bolster its manufacturing capacity in the US.\n\nCiti analyst Christopher Danely said the exemptions mean the semiconductor tariff will have “minimal impact … as US-based semiconductor companies with in-house fabs have operations in the US and fabless companies can commit to using TSMC, Samsung, GFS which have operations in the US.”\n\n“Fabs” refer to factories where chips are produced, and “fabless” companies outsource production of their chips to contract manufacturers such as TSMC, Samsung (005930.KS), and GFS (GFS). Companies with in-house fabs include Intel (INTC), Micron, and Texas Instruments. Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Qualcomm (QCOM) are fabless.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) analyst Joseph Moore echoed Danely's sentiment, writing in a note to clients Thursday, “To some degree this outcome would be something of a relief.”\n\n“Yes, 100% tariffs are unpalatable but if companies are given time to restore them, the real tax is just the higher cost of building chips in the United States,\" he wrote. \"The biggest fear was that such a tariff would be implemented immediately.”", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:10:22.520797+00:00"}

While these platforms showcase technological leadership, adoption has been slower than expected. Despite bullish commentary on strong OEM interest and testing progress, Mobileye has yet to secure major new contracts for SuperVision or Chauffeur, with timelines slipping toward 2028 due to OEM decision delays and limited competitive urgency outside China.\n\nManagement acknowledged slow momentum in L2+ and L3, citing unclear OEM pricing strategies and lack of market pressure. The bright spot remains Drive, Mobileye’s L4 platform, which is scaling faster than anticipated with Volkswagen and could exceed 100,000 vehicles by decade’s end. The launch of the EyeQ6 chipset and continued execution on advanced programs reinforce Mobileye’s strong technology base, but without new wins, the near-term growth outlook remains uncertain.

Therefore, it is wise to be aware of the facts that can impact the stock's prospects.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-incorporated-qcom-trending-stock-130004646.html", "published_at": "2025-08-04T13:00:04Z", "source": "Zacks", "text": "Qualcomm (QCOM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -8.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has gained 3.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nQualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.79 points to a change of +15.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.84 indicates a change of +0.4% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:10:45.483787+00:00"}

Investors often invest for retirement, and with $3,000 unable to cover one month of expenses for the average American, that figure may seem like a pittance.\n\nNonetheless, some of the more astute investors have built fortunes on less capital. With time, such a figure can grow to a massive amount with the right stocks or indexes held for decades. Amid such growth prospects, investors may want to consider three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks with considerable potential for returns.\n\nAlphabet\n\nIf one is going to put together a portfolio of AI stocks, the place to start is likely Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%). Alphabet has used AI since 2001, and investors saw it as a leader in the industry until ChatGPT put generative AI on the map in 2023.\n\nDespite its release of Gemini soon after, investors have perceived Alphabet as falling behind in this industry. As a result, Google Search's market share is now under 90%, according to Statcounter. This is critical since Alphabet continues to depend heavily on the ad revenue it generates.\n\nHowever, Alphabet has seemingly endless resources to compete. It pledged to invest $75 billion in capital expenditures (CapEx) this year and holds $95 billion in liquidity.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet has begun diversifying away from advertising. Google Cloud now accounts for 14% of the company's revenue, and assuming autonomous vehicles succeed, Waymo could become a primary revenue source for the company.\n\nFinally, amid the concerns about its business, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 21, the lowest of the Magnificent Seven. This gives investors the opportunity to buy at a discount while benefiting from the AI-driven transformation of the tech giant.\n\nSentinelOne\n\nSentinelOne (S 3.10%) has built a compelling cybersecurity suite. It based its platform, Singularity XDR, on AI from the beginning, and it specializes in protecting endpoints, cloud workloads, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and containers.\n\nThe cybersecurity industry provides tools that are essential for the cloud and AI, but its competitive nature complicates investing in this sector. Still, Grand View Research expects it to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% through 2030, making it likely to grow even with that competition.\n\nFortunately, SentinelOne continues to beat that growth rate. In the first quarter of its fiscal 2026 (ended April 30), the company reported $229 million in revenue, an increase of 23% over the previous year.\n\nAdmittedly, losses have weighed on the company. With the income tax provision rising to $133 million, the company reported a loss of more than $208 million, up from $70 million in the year-ago quarter. Fortunately, free cash flow remains positive at $45 million, which eases the pain of the net loss.\n\nThe losses may have also made SentinelOne's valuation more attractive. As a money-losing company, it does not have a P/E ratio, but a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 7 is far below most of its most prominent competitors', allowing people to invest in this growth industry at a low cost.\n\nQualcomm\n\nAfter years of strength and considerable stock price growth, Qualcomm's (QCOM 3.89%) stock has struggled. Its longtime lead in the smartphone chipset industry is in question as Apple moves to drop Qualcomm as a supplier. The company's heavy dependence on China has also caused doubts in an uncertain geopolitical environment.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm has long envisioned a day when people and businesses depend less on smartphones. In order to align itself with the future of its industry, it entered chip businesses outside of the smartphone arena.\n\nWith those moves, it has diversified into chips for IoT, automotive, PCs, and data centers, and some of these businesses have shown success. In the third quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended June 29), IoT revenue rose 24%, and automotive revenue increased by 21% over the same period. In comparison, the dominant handset segment grew revenue by 7% over the last year.\n\nOverall, revenue surged 10% higher in fiscal Q3 to almost $10.4 billion. The company kept cost and expense growth in check, meaning the $2.7 billion in net income rose 25%.\n\nDespite that growth, Qualcomm trades at just 16 times earnings. Although it faces challenges, such an earnings multiple likely prices in its struggles. Knowing that, investors may want to consider buying this chip stock before more people notice its emerging business segments and rock-bottom P/E ratio.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:10:47.606289+00:00"}

The company has warned that when Apple goes away, it will impact its chip segment revenue.\n\nQualcomm reported that its chip segment revenue from non-Apple customers has climbed more than 15% so far. According to William McGonigle, analyst at Third Bridge, the chip segment sales increase, excluding Apple, “is largely driven by ASP (average selling price) uplift from flagship Android launches rather than broad-based volume recovery.”\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops wireless technologies, supplies chips for mobile, automotive, and IoT, licenses patents, and invests in emerging tech.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

He trimmed his fourth-quarter forecast slightly to $10.65 billion in revenue and $2.85 EPS, and now expects fiscal 2025 revenue of $43.52 billion and EPS of $11.88.\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Tal Liani also reiterated a Buy with a $200 forecast, emphasizing Qualcomm’s progress in diversifying beyond smartphones.\n\nWhile handset revenue was marginally below expectations due to mix and timing issues, automotive and IoT gains, up 21.3% and 23.7% respectively, provided an effective offset.\n\nLiani sees handset revenue rebounding in the next quarter, with forward guidance implying aggregate third-quarter and fourth-quarter performance should beat Street expectations. He also pointed to a stronger-than-expected operating margin that contributed to a 5-cent EPS beat.\n\nLiani noted that non-handset revenue now comprises 30% of QCT sales, up from 25% three years ago, and is projected to grow 16% in 2025 and 20% in 2026.\n\nHe highlighted strong design momentum in automotive, with 12 digital chassis wins and 50 new vehicle launches this year.

Compounded by the lack of a strong artificial intelligence strategy, high exposure to tariff risk and regulators targeting its highly profitable relationship with Alphabet Inc., it’s hard to see them rebounding any time soon — especially as they continue to trade at a premium valuation.\n\n“Apple’s embarrassing AI shows how it has lost its mojo with innovation, and the lack of innovation speaks to the lack of revenue growth, and that speaks to why we don’t see upside in the stock,” said Peter Andersen, founder and chief investment officer of Andersen Capital Management. “It is valued like a growth stock, but I’m very skeptical about the potential for a significant inflection in growth, and I think it will eventually lose that premium.”\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report a 2.4% rise in quarterly profits on a 4.1% gain in revenues, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The overall tech sector’s anticipated earnings growth is 16.8% on a 13% jump in revenue, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThe stock dipped 0.2% on Thursday.\n\nThis helps explain why Apple is among the 15 worst-performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index this year and why it lags every one of the Magnificent Seven tech giants other than Tesla.\n\nBut even with this year’s slide, Apple’s stock still trades at almost 28 times estimated earnings, higher than its 10-year average of 21. The shares are pricier than the Nasdaq 100 as well as megacap peers that are far better positioned in AI, like Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nNegative Sentiment\n\nThe combination of tepid growth and a high valuation is why sentiment toward the one-time consensus favorite has become “fairly negative,” according to Bank of America. In a sign of their historically weak momentum trends, shares have been below their 200-day moving average since March 10, a 98-session streak — as of Wednesday’s close — that matches its longest since February 2023. Should it close below the key technical level on Thursday, that would represent its longest streak in almost a decade.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:11:03.873671+00:00"}

Joining me now, Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm CEO. Cristiano, it's always great to see you. And indeed, the numbers beat estimates. Your forecast leaving you some room to beat estimates. And those phone related sales did rise by 7%. But I saw a lot of commentary around the mix within that segment. Can you talk us through that a little bit?\n\n00:35 Cristiano Amon\n\nAbsolutely. Good talking to you, Julie. Look, we're happy with the results. We, we're doing what we said we're going to do and actually we we are seeing growth in the handsets and and important to highlight, we don't see any pull ins. We seeing growth. It's just a quarter that we don't have flagship launches. We going to have next quarter that is reflected in our guide. And we continue to see an opportunity for us to expand within the Android ecosystem. So I I frankly, I don't know what, what people not like about it. The most important thing, we continue to grow, the company diversified the company and we provide a new metric, which was 15% of QCT non Apple revenues. We're going to see the second consecutive year of 15%. So that shows the earnings power of the business and QCT non Apple growing double digit.\n\n02:24 Speaker A\n\nAnd Cristiano for folks who are not familiar, QCT is the the handset chips. And um Chip business. Chip business.\n\n02:39 Cristiano Amon\n\nChip business.\n\n02:40 Speaker A\n\nRight. And your contract with Apple for its modems for its chips is rolling off over the next few years. This is well known. And as you say, you've been very transparent about sort of how you're going to try to make up for that. And this new metric is sort of lending to that. You and I have been talking for a while and diversification has been the name of the game for a while now for Qualcomm. What grade would you give yourself? Where are you in that journey for making up for that expected roll off in the Apple revenue?\n\n03:20 Cristiano Amon\n\nRemember we, we had said, uh, back in our investor day in 2024, that we have a plan that we're going to create $22 billion of non non handsets. That's non handsets. Uh, which is automotive and IOT by fiscal 29. And we've been executing diligent on that plan and everything is tracking to what we said we're going to do. So we're happy with the execution. Additionally, we said that the Android market will be growing at a 5% cager. We have been delivering consistently more than 5% growth on Android, which was actually growing faster than the market. So we, we're just executing on the plan and what that will do, will allow us to replace Apple twice. We had done it in the past, uh, when you look of the growth that we created on the other business and continue to grow. The earnings power of the business, non Apple is what we provided when we provide this metric of 15% growth on the per year on the chip business.\n\n05:11 Speaker A\n\nUm, let's talk about internet of things a little bit more, right? Because part of that is going to be potentially things like the meta glasses and other sort of personal devices that incorporate AI. What do you think is the potential for that business? You know, as you said at your investor day last year, you laid some of this out and we talked about it then. Now that there have been sort of more product introductions, give us an update on that.\n\n05:48 Cristiano Amon\n\nYes, and I'll point to what Mark Zuckerberg said yesterday because this there's also an an connection how you should think about mobile, even though this is a different category of device. We are starting to see now personal AI taking a hold. And we used to think about glasses and watches and earbuds as as devices that their main job was to extend the capability of your smartphone. Now they're center around the human and the model and we're starting to see a genetic experiences, uh, when you just connect to the AI directly. No legacy, you have just a new type of apps that are coming with AI. And that's reflected on the fact that we've been talking quarter after quarter about the excitement we see on the glasses with the meta ray ban, continue to exceed expectations. And now we have 19 different designs of those type of devices. And I think as AI evolves and the Android ecosystem is very strong now, uh, we see an opportunity to also reflect back in increasing, uh, uh the size of the Android market as users are going to be looking for AI type of experience, uh, for the new mobile devices.\n\n07:47 Speaker A\n\nLet's also talk um data center chips, which is not something I'm used to talking about with you, right? But this is something you guys are getting into now. You said you're in talks with a hyperscaler to sell AI data center chips. Um, where does Qualcomm fit into the market? As I said, it's not, you know, people are used to thinking of Nvidia, used to thinking of AMD to some degree, or a company like Broadcom. Where does Qualcomm fit into that market?\n\n08:22 Cristiano Amon\n\nThe way, the way investors should think about this, it creates optionality on Qualcomm. So the data center, as you know, is a massive, uh, addressable market and because of the evolution of AI, there will continue to be investments in the data center for decades. We have assets they're very relevant for the data center and their transitions that are becoming incredibly important to create an entry point for Qualcomm. One transition is the general purpose CPU that used to be an merchant CPU with an X86 instruction set, that is becoming an arm compatible CPU and you use that for a head unit of an AI cluster or for, uh, some, uh, applications of the hyperscalers for their first party, uh, software. The second thing that is happening is AI scale is moving from training to inference. You started to see inference clusters being built dedicated for inference. In that game, it's about, can you deliver the largest amount of tokens with the smallest power consumption and a better, a better outcome in, uh, performance per dollars? This is where we believe we have IP that is relevant. We made an important acquisition called Alpha Wave that complements our road map. We're now focus on the approval and we start, uh, developing products and having conversations with hyperscalers. Having said that, Right.\n\n10:36 Speaker A\n\nwe said that's in the beginning. We expect revenues to, uh, started to materialize in fiscal 28. We will be looking for that. Cristiano, very quickly to leave us here. Tariff impact for you guys. I know it it's limited sort of by the mix of your business, but but what's the impact? How are you thinking about it right now?\n\n11:00 Cristiano Amon\n\nUh, direct, we have not seen any impact and as I said before, no pull ins related to tariffs. Uh, that's reflected in our strong guide. I think indirectly, whether that would change market sizes or make products more expensive, we're like everybody else, uh, you know, waiting to see how that develop, but so far we have not seen any material impact.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:11:07.993198+00:00"}

He said, in his presser after the FOMC release, that core Personal Consumption Expenditures were little changed from the start of the year, but that tariffs were beginning to push up inflation metrics.\n\nThe difference between yesterday's monetary policy decision and those released earlier this year was we did not see a unanimous decision to keep rates steady. Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — both Fed governors, not regional presidents — opted for a 25 basis point (bps) cut; Fed Governor Adriana Kugler was absent and did not vote.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) yesterday decided to keep interest rates steady at +4.25-4.50%, as they have in all five meetings so far in 2025.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nChipmaker Qualcomm saw its fiscal third quarter revenue grow 10% to $10.4 billion over last year, driven in part by expansions into emerging markets, such as artificial intelligence-backed personal computers and smart glasses.\n\nto $10.4 billion The San Diego-based company reported 23% growth in its automotive and internet-connected segments, accounting for nearly $2.7 billion in revenue, as well as ongoing strength in chipset sales for smartphones. Net income grew 25% to $2.7 billion in the quarter versus last year.\n\nQualcomm is also making progress with its expansion into data center chips following its agreement last month to buy Alphawave Semi for $2.4 billion . During an earnings call July 30 , CEO Cristiano Amon said he is already in talks with potential customers and expects to see data center revenues by fiscal year 2028.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nQualcomm, a maker of Snapdragon processors used in smartphones, laptops and other mobile devices, has been focused on diversifying its products to better accommodate the AI boom and reduce its reliance on the smartphone market.\n\nQualcomm’s acquisition of Alphawave Semi, set to close in calendar year Q1 2026, aligns with that strategy, Amon said. It would provide Qualcomm with Alphawave’s intellectual property and data center design capabilities, bolstering the chipmaker’s high-speed wire connectivity and compute silicon solutions.\n\n“While we are in the early stages of this expansion, we are engaged with multiple potential customers and are currently in advanced discussions with a leading hyperscaler,” Amon said. In May, Qualcomm signed a memorandum of understanding with Humain to develop AI data centers in Saudi Arabia. It has also made its Oryon processors compatible with Nvidia technology for data center applications.\n\nIn addition to meeting data center demand, it’s betting on smart glasses and wearable technology to reshape the consumer electronics landscape. As AI continues to advance, Amon said these devices are transitioning beyond simply extensions of smartphones into new and unique experiences.\n\n“We’re very optimistic about the trends we see in this area with major AI players, application developers and device makers investing in this space,” Amon said.\n\nQualcomm is already a major chipset supplier for Meta’s smart glasses, which recently expanded into Oakley and Ray-Ban styles. It also has a partnership with China’s Xiaomi, which launched its AI glasses in the quarter.\n\nBeyond wearables, Qualcomm is also seeing traction with its automotive business, driven by its digital chassis solutions, as well as industrial demand, Amon said.\n\nThe chipmaker has been taking steps to prepare for when Apple, one of its largest customers, stops buying its products altogether. Apple debuted its first modem chip with the launch of its iPhone 16e in February.

The company's chips power a sizable fraction of smartphones around the world, but other revenue streams are growing much faster.\n\nRevenue related to smartphones grew by 7% year over year to $6.3 billion. Meanwhile, automotive revenue surged by 21% to $984 million, and Internet of Things revenue jumped 24% to $1.7 billion. The company's next-generation augmented reality platform was recently on display powering Meta Platforms' (META 3.16%) AI smart glasses, enabling a 1 billion parameter AI model to be run locally.\n\nQualcomm is also making a push into the PC industry. The company's Snapdragon X platform is expected to power more than 100 models by the end of 2026 from all of the major PC OEMs.\n\nRevenue from the technology licensing segment was $1.32 billion, up 4% year over year. Growth across Qualcomm's segments helped push adjusted earnings per share up 19% year over year in the third quarter.\n\nImmediate Market Reaction\n\nDespite a solid third-quarter report that featured better-than-expected revenue growth, shares of Qualcomm were down about 5% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Qualcomm stock has been a laggard so far this year, up just 4% year to date going into the third-quarter report.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nOn top of Qualcomm getting its chips into PCs and augmented reality devices, the company is going after the AI infrastructure market as well. Qualcomm offers server CPUs as well as AI inference chips, and the company announced the acquisition of Alphawave Semi in June. Alphawave specializes in high-speed wired connectivity products, which will help fill out Qualcomm's data center portfolio as demand for AI infrastructure booms.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Qualcomm expects to produce revenue between $10.3 billion and $11.1 billion, along with adjusted EPS between $2.75 and $2.95.

Company reporting a beat on the top and bottom line, but the stock is under some pressure here after hours. For more, Corey Johnson, Chief market strategist at Episprophy Capital Research and host of the Drill Down podcast. Corey, it is always great to see you. Let's start, Corey, with Qualcomm. It looks like we have some initial disappointment in the after hours. My friends, stock's down about 4%. But what do you make of the results? Walk us through the report.\n\n01:07 Corey Johnson\n\nThe results aren't bad here. I mean, we've saw some real progress across a lot of product lines. Uh, you know, of course, the concern with Qualcomm is always going to be in mobile phones, but as they grow out this business to be in other places, they're showing some real strength there. So, uh, in particular, their Snapdragon 8 Elite showing up in some Samsung foldable phones. It's a really hot product category right now. It's kind of top of the line at Samsung. And they're having great success there with the Snapdragon 8 Elite. They've also showed some really strong growth, um, you know, throughout their other acquisitions into data centers. There's a company that they bought called Alpha Wave. And Alpha Wave has seemed to really help them in terms of getting into the data center and expanding their business beyond the mobile phone market. Now, the mobile phone market has been tough for the last year or so, but, uh, I think it was generally a pretty good print for Qualcomm.\n\n02:43 Speaker A\n\nUh, how would you expect, Corey, on the call that execs try to sort of frame the tariff issue and and resulting impact to demand for devices that contain their chips?\n\n03:08 Corey Johnson\n\nYeah. Yeah. So one of the most interesting things going on with Qualcomm right now is their automotive business. It's nearly a billion dollars. They reported $984 billion, $984 million, I should say, in the quarter. That's up 21% year over year, which is so much more than the growth in automotive sales in any geography. And so what you see happening for Qualcomm is what's happening in the automotive industry, which is lots more silicon in every single vehicle, such that it's a very big business for companies like Qualcomm. But you wonder what's going to happen because tariffs hitting so hard on the auto makers, or likely to hit them so hard, and then we might get some clues about that as it relates to the orders of semiconductors. So it's not just tech nerds like you and me digging into these calls. It's a lot of the overall industry, overall economy is going to be listening to what's happening with Qualcomm because it's going to tell us a lot, not just about tech, but about what's also happening in the automotive sector.\n\n04:48 Speaker A\n\nYou ask a broader question, Corey, which is about platform independence and why that's a risk for chip makers. Walk us through that.\n\n05:13 Corey Johnson\n\nWell, I think fundamentally, um, you know, the chip companies want to get, and no company has done this more probably, arguably, than Qualcomm, which is not only do they get sort of attached to the socket, the space in the phone is their space to lose, they can't lose it. And then they want to have a very unique offering that only they can solve that problem. Problem is, of course, the phone makers don't want that, and consumers might not want that. They want to be able to kind of move services from device to device and, of course, lower prices because you've got lots of competitors there.

Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Thankfully, Qualcomm’s 16.6% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was excellent. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n\nQualcomm Quarterly Revenue\n\nLong-term growth is the most important, but short-term results matter for semiconductors because the rapid pace of technological innovation (Moore's Law) could make yesterday's hit product obsolete today. Qualcomm’s annualized revenue growth of 5.7% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were respectable.\n\nQualcomm Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\n\nThis quarter, Qualcomm’s year-on-year revenue growth was 10.3%, and its $10.37 billion of revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Although the company met estimates, this was its third consecutive quarter of decelerating growth, potentially indicating a coming cyclical downturn. Company management is currently guiding for a 4.5% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:11:34.757966+00:00"}

A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $2.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.85, delivering a surprise of +0.71%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nQualcomm, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, posted revenues of $10.37 billion for the quarter ended June 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.15%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $9.39 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nQualcomm shares have added about 5.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Qualcomm?\n\nWhile Qualcomm has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Qualcomm was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

Under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in advanced AI and 5G technologies to drive nationwide digital transformation. Qualcomm has positioned itself as a key player in that initiative. QCOM has joined forces with HUMAIN to develop AI data centers to deliver cloud-to-edge hybrid AI services. It has formed a partnership with Aramco Digital to support the development of advanced edge AI industrial IoT devices and end-to-end solutions.\n\nDuring the quarter, Qualcomm introduced the cutting-edge Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform. With cutting-edge CPU and GPU capabilities, the solution offers significantly improved AI performance, enhanced gaming, content generation and connectivity features. The newly launched solution has already gained solid market traction. Leading OEMs, such as HONOR and vivo, have already selected the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform for their upcoming devices. Realme is also expected to adopt the new platform.\n\nOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for Qualcomm for the fiscal third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is perfectly the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Qualcomm currently has an ESP of +0.60% with a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chip manufacturer delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.43%, on average, beating estimates on each occasion. In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off an earnings surprise of 0.71%.\n\nQualcomm Inc. is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on July 30, 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is pegged at $10.36 billion and $2.68 per share, respectively. Over the past 60 days, earnings estimate for QCOM for fiscal 2025 has declined 0.26% and for fiscal 2026 it has declined 1.99%.\n\nChicago, IL – July 29, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Intel Corp. INTC.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn the third quarter, the company acquired Autotalks to enhance its vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology offerings for safer, smarter transportation systems. Qualcomm has also acquired MovianAI, the former generative AI division of VinAI, a prominent Vietnam-based AI company. The acquisition will give Qualcomm access to VinAI's comprehensive expertise in generative AI, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.\n\nIt has also inked a definitive agreement to acquire Alphawave Semi for an enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion. With advanced technology solutions that are complementary to power-efficient CPU and NPU cores, Alphawave Semi delivers connectivity products and chiplets that drive faster, more reliable data transfer with higher performance and lower power consumption for 5G wireless, AI and data center applications. These acquisitions will significantly bolster Qualcomm's AI capabilities.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nOver the past year, Qualcomm has lost 10.3% against the industry's growth of 41%, lagging peers like Broadcom Inc. but outperforming Intel Corp.. During this period, Broadcom has gained 93.8%, while Intel has declined 32.2%.\n\nKey Valuation Metric\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Qualcomm appears to be relatively cheaper compared to the industry and below its mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 13.44 forward earnings, lower than 34.13 for the industry and the stock's mean of 16.97.\n\nInvestment Considerations\n\nQualcomm is aiming to be the driving force of the next wave of AI innovation. Its recent strategic acquisitions and innovation initiative are perfectly aligned with that strategy. The buyouts will provide Qualcomm's access to next-generation technology, bolster its R&D initiatives, and facilitate the development of state-of-the-art AI-driven solutions for a wide range of industries, including smartphones, PCs, software-defined vehicles and more.\n\nThe company is witnessing healthy traction in the premium handset market. However, intensifying competition from low-cost chip manufacturers like MediaTek and Rockchip is impacting margins in the mid-range smartphone market. The company has been taking actions to counter these issues. It is introducing several cutting-edge AI features in its chips for mid-range smartphones, and it has been actively collaborating with major smartphone manufacturers to develop a solution tailored to their requirements.\n\nQualcomm is also expanding its portfolio offerings to enhance resiliency in its business model. The company is expected to benefit from strong demand for its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform in the automotive market. These factors will likely boost commercial prospects.\n\nHowever, despite some setbacks, Intel has remained a major player in chipset development. The company's growing prowess in the AI PC vertical can pose a challenge to Qualcomm's AI PC expansion. The company is also facing competition from Broadcom, which is a prominent supplier of RF Components to leading smartphone makers.\n\nEnd Note\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #3, QCOM appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution. Intensifying competition in the smartphone vertical is putting pressure on profitability. Declining earnings estimates highlight bearish sentiment.\n\nHowever, the results of a single quarter are not so vital for long-term stakeholders. Investors who already own the stock may consider holding on to it. Qualcomm is ramping up its AI initiatives, diversifying its portfolio to capitalize on the emerging trends across multiple end markets. Growing traction in high-end smartphones, advanced driver assistance, V2X communication, AI PC and IoT space is positive. Strategic buyouts are enhancing portfolio strength. Such development augurs well for long-term sustainable growth.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is perfectly the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\n\n\nQualcomm currently has an ESP of +0.60% with a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors Shaping the Upcoming Results\n\nDuring the quarter, Qualcomm introduced the cutting-edge Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform. With cutting-edge CPU and GPU capabilities, the solution offers significantly improved AI performance, enhanced gaming, content generation and connectivity features. The newly launched solution has already gained solid market traction. Leading OEMs, such as HONOR and vivo, have already selected the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform for their upcoming devices. Realme is also expected to adopt the new platform.\n\n\n\nIn the Quarter under review, Qualcomm was selected by e& a global technology group to strengthen digital infrastructure across the UAE. Under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in advanced AI and 5G technologies to drive nationwide digital transformation. Qualcomm has positioned itself as a key player in that initiative. QCOM has joined forces with HUMAIN to develop AI data centers to deliver cloud-to-edge hybrid AI services. It has formed a partnership with Aramco Digital to support the development of advanced edge AI industrial IoT devices and end-to-end solutions.\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter, the company acquired Autotalks to enhance its vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology offerings for safer, smarter transportation systems. Qualcomm has also acquired MovianAI, the former generative AI division of VinAI, a prominent Vietnam-based AI company. The acquisition will give Qualcomm access to VinAI’s comprehensive expertise in generative AI, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.\n\n\n\nIt has also inked a definitive agreement to acquire Alphawave Semi for an enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion. With advanced technology solutions that are complementary to power-efficient CPU and NPU cores, Alphawave Semi delivers connectivity products and chiplets that drive faster, more reliable data transfer with higher performance and lower power consumption for 5G wireless, AI and data center applications. These acquisitions will significantly bolster Qualcomm’s AI capabilities.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:12:15.508136+00:00"}

Quote\n\nLet us see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nFactors Likely to Influence FIVN’s Q2 Results\n\nFive9’s second-quarter 2025 performance is expected to have benefited from sustained momentum in its enterprise AI revenues. In the last reported financial results for the first quarter, enterprise AI revenues jumped 32% year over year and accounted for 9% of its enterprise subscription sales. This trend is likely to have carried into the second quarter as the company continues to push toward AI-based solutions — an area that not only attracts higher-value contracts but also supports long-term profitability.\n\nFive9 has entered 2025 on a solid financial footing. It posted a strong 18.8% adjusted EBITDA margin and $35 million in free cash flow in the first quarter. This operational efficiency gives Five9 a cushion to invest further in product innovation and customer acquisition — two key drivers that are likely to have contributed to the second-quarter strength as well.\n\nStrategic partnerships also seem to have contributed significantly to Five9’s second-quarter growth. Ties with big names like Salesforce, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Verint and Google help the company build more tailored AI tools and improve its integration across platforms.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAs Riveron CFO Tony Ciotti sees it, the lines between financial teams and operations teams are rapidly blurring. In some cases, he says, they’re “just nonexistent.”\n\nConsider the rise of the chief operating and finance officer, or COFO. Salesforce and Qualcomm are among the latest big companies to appoint individuals to this hybrid role. Though Ciotti is not one himself, he predicts it’s a trend that will continue in the years ahead.\n\nCiotti came into his role as CFO of Riveron after years in operations at firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Grant Thornton. He first joined the latter as operations director back in September 2013.\n\nJust about a decade later, he followed Grant Thornton’s former CFO Sam Shaw over to Riveron, where Shaw now serves as chief executive.\n\nIn an interview with CFO.com, Ciotti talks through why he believes finance and operations will continue to meld, how he approaches leadership under private equity and what he’s learned from financial crises over the years.\n\nTony Ciotti\n\nOptional Caption Permission granted by Riveron\n\nCFO, Riveron\n\nFirst CFO position: November 2023\n\nNotable previous employers:\n\nGrant Thornton\n\nPwC\n\nAccenture\n\nThis conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nDAN NIEPOW: You’ve spent a lot of your career so far working in operations roles. What led you to turn to the financial side of things and to becoming a CFO specifically?\n\nTONY CIOTTI: I followed a less-than-traditional path to CFO. But I would also say, candidly, that the definition of a “traditional path” is changing by the day. I see and hear this all the time among my CFO brethren. I am not hearing or seeing the CPA-required, compliance-oriented mindset of the past. We are seeing more and more operators in these roles.\n\nMy experience in operations has set me up for success, as much as my experience in finance has. In my mind, it's all about having the ability to span across different functions in an organization while maintaining a strong financial perspective. And as part of the operations team, I've led resource management functions, recruiting functions, marketing, sales, IT functions. It makes me more than just the numbers guy who's prescribing something to you.\n\nAs for Riveron specifically, I was attracted to the company’s mission and team. The firm is full of people who’ve sat in the CFO seat for private equity companies, for portfolio companies, for publicly traded companies and privately held companies. It’s been a great way to dive into my first CFO role.\n\nWhat do you think finance teams can learn from operations teams?\n\nIn today’s companies, there’s so much overlap between finance and ops. I think the lines can essentially be blurred, or, in many cases, nonexistent. As I came up through prior firms, we consistently relied on financial-operator types — people who sat in between the business, supporting day-to-day operations and supporting the finance function. They were squarely in between, straddling that fence.\n\nI’d also say operators, at times, have a broader purview and perspective. It’s a powerful position to consider, particularly when you parlay that with financial literacy. Then you've got someone who has done the job that the practice trusts, but that the finance function and accounting function know and trust as well. That’s a great example of where these lines start to blur.\n\nWe’re seeing more and more companies appointing COFOs — chief operating and financial officers. Given your history, what’s your take on this trend? Do you expect this to be something we’ll continue to see?\n\nAbsolutely, I expect it to continue on steroids. We see this every day with our client base at Riveron. These two roles often go hand in hand or get blended into a single role. We’re also seeing the aperture for CFOs being broadened tremendously. We're expected to be much more than a cost center or a financial voice of the firm. We have to do more than deliver the financial news.\n\n“In today’s companies, there’s so much overlap between finance and ops. I think the lines can essentially be blurred, or, in many cases, nonexistent.” Tony Ciotti CFO, Riveron\n\nIn my case, for example, I'm in the boardroom all the time. I’m not just talking about what happened, but also about what will happen and why, and what I’m doing about it. We've become strategy enablers. Yes, there's still the compliance lean to it.\n\nWe’re also responsible for driving growth and profitability. And yet, in my world, I’m seeing regulatory, tax compliance and the more traditional focus of the past gradually landing with highly capable controllers and accounting teams. I've been fortunate enough to have some rockstar controllers who’ve enabled me to step up and focus on bigger picture things. That’s also enabling many other modern CFOs to focus on strategic priorities in tandem with the CEO and in tandem. And that's where I see that blended COFO role being very powerful.\n\nRiveron was acquired by private equity firm Kohlberg & Co. about two years ago. Can you talk a bit about what it’s like leading a private equity-owned company?\n\nWe were owned by H.I.G. Capital before the Kohlberg deal, so we’re very familiar with private equity. I would say the goals remain the same, regardless of ownership structure: deliver exceptional client service, drive high growth, take market share and scale.\n\nIn Kohlberg, we have a financial sponsor who has strong conviction in their investment thesis, and they've opened up a lot of growth opportunities for us. Like any portfolio company, we move at a very fast pace. We are aggressive in our pursuit of growth, but we also know when to quickly call the ball and pivot when something isn't working.\n\n“Use today’s headwinds as a catalyst for change. Maybe that means evaluating opportunities now for the incorporation of things like artificial intelligence or other emerging tech. The truth is, the more you wait, the more behind you’ll be.” Tony Ciotti CFO, Riveron\n\nAnd we still maintain a “think like an owner” mindset. It allows us to drive value in the short and long term. We also serve plenty of private equity clients; we like to say we’re built by PE, for PE. We understand the expectations of sponsors and the needs of portfolio companies. We speak the language.\n\nThe announcement about your acquisition noted that a “a significant percentage of Riveron’s employee base will also be equity owners in the company.” Can you talk a bit about that dynamic? Is Riveron still partly employee-owned, then?\n\nIt is. It’s a great structure, and a great feather in our cap. We encourage our employees to directly participate in the value creation opportunity under Kohlberg’s hold. Once they reach a certain level, employees have the option to purchase common equity in the firm, subject to investment caps.\n\nToday, hundreds of our 1,200 employees sit on the cap table. They've invested their own money in the firm, and their collective equity position in the firm is sizable. I mentioned “thinking like an owner” in response to your last question; there's no better way to drive employees to think like an owner than to be one. For us, it’s been a hugely motivating differentiator at Riveron. Nearly everyone eligible to participate does.\n\nOn your LinkedIn page, you said you have “specific expertise in helping firms ‘survive and thrive’ in times of financial crisis.” What would you say are the most important elements for companies to keep in mind during a financial crisis or downturn?\n\nIf you look back at any of the recent crises — whether that’s the Great Recession, COVID-19 or even this current cycle — there are consistent themes that emerge and opportunities that arise. That’s my starting point mentality: Where’s the opportunity in this climate? I try to see today’s uncertainty as tomorrow’s opportunity. Use today’s headwinds as a catalyst for change. Maybe that means evaluating opportunities now for the incorporation of things like artificial intelligence or other emerging tech. The truth is, the more you wait, the more behind you’ll be.\n\nI say that with confidence because these changes are coming, agnostic of whatever the economy looks like in six months or a year.

The company, commonly known as TSMC, reported second quarter results on July 17, only to remind the market why it is one of the best ways to capitalize on the growth in AI semiconductor demand.\n\nAll the major chip companies, such as Broadcom, Marvell, Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, have been using TSMC's fabrication plants to manufacture their AI chips. Moreover, the chips that go into AI-enabled smartphones are manufactured at TSMC's facilities since it counts the likes of Qualcomm and Apple as customers too.\n\nThis world-class client base and the secular growth of the AI chip market allowed TSMC to deliver outstanding Q2 results and boost its full-year guidance as well. Take a closer look at the latest numbers, and you'll see why it's not too late for investors to buy this hot AI stock.\n\nTSMC's AI-fueled growth is here to stay\n\nTSMC reported an impressive 44% year-over-year increase in its Q2 revenue to $30.1 billion, exceeding the high end of its guidance range. Meanwhile, the company's adjusted earnings per share shot up at a much faster pace of 61%, a testament to its solid pricing power.\n\nTSMC controls 68% of the global semiconductor foundry market, well ahead of its closest rival, Samsung, which has a market share of just under 8%. The company has managed to build such a huge gap over the competition thanks to the technological lead of its process nodes. As a result, TSMC has the ability to raise the prices of its services, and that explains why its gross margin increased by more than five percentage points last quarter from the prior-year period.\n\nImportantly, TSMC is now anticipating its full-year revenue will grow 30% in 2025, up from its earlier estimate of mid-20% growth. But TSMC could end the year with an even bigger top-line jump as it has already achieved 40% year-over-year growth in the first half of 2025, and it is expecting a 38% spike in revenue in the current quarter (at the midpoint of guidance).\n\nWhat's worth noting here is that TSMC says its guidance takes into account the potential impact of tariffs on its business. Even then, the company has raised its full-year outlook, and it won't be surprising to see it end 2025 with a bigger-than-expected jump in revenue and earnings. In fact, TSMC's red-hot growth seems sustainable for a long time to come, considering the secular growth opportunity presented by AI.\n\nThe various AI-focused end-markets that TSMC serves are on track to boom remarkably in the next five years. For instance, the investment in AI chips and computing hardware could exceed a whopping $3 trillion by 2030, according to the consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts are also increasing their estimates for the company's earnings through 2027.\n\nThe stock is built for more upside\n\nTSMC stock has jumped an impressive 59% in the past three months. Even then, it is trading at 28 times trailing earnings as compared to the tech-laden Nasdaq 100 index's average earnings multiple of more than 32. The forward earnings multiple of 24 is even more attractive and is yet another signal of the company's continued bottom-line growth.\n\nInvestors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolios should consider buying TSMC as a top pick. It has room to run higher and is trading at a discount to the broader technology sector, despite quarter after quarter of outstanding execution.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:12:37.066208+00:00"}

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:12:53.366035+00:00"}

But Nvidia could face tough competition in the future. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC’s 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia's access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses TSMC's 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Nice (NICE) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.02 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on August 21, 2025.\n\nNice's Earnings ESP sits at +0.93%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.02 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.99.\n\nNICE is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Qualcomm (QCOM) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nSlated to report earnings on July 30, 2025, Qualcomm holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and its Most Accurate Estimate is $2.7 a share seven days from its next quarterly update.\n\nFor Qualcomm, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.68 is +0.60%.\n\nNICE and QCOM's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8.54%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Qualcomm was expected to post earnings of $2.85 per share, but it reported $2.83 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.71%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.93 per share, while it actually produced $3.41 per share, a surprise of 16.38%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Qualcomm. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.

When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on July 30, 2025.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain.

In our view, this optimism is backed by solid fundamentals, and LRCX still looks attractive, even after the recent rally.\n\nAI and Chip Trends Power LRCX’s Momentum\n\nLam Research is benefiting from powerful shifts in semiconductor demand, particularly around artificial intelligence (AI) and data center chips. These advanced chips require complex manufacturing, and Lam provides the essential tools, like deposition and etching systems, needed to build them.\n\nIn 2024 alone, Lam Research shipped more than $1 billion worth of products tied to next-gen chip technologies and packaging. The figure is expected to triple in 2025. LRCX’s equipment is especially critical as the industry moves toward innovations like backside power delivery and dry-resist processing.\n\nLam Research’s steady investments in research & development and new products are paying off. Its Cryo 3.0 technology has set new standards in the industry, and the Aether dry-resist system is being adopted, especially for high-bandwidth DRAM.\n\nExpanding its manufacturing operations in Asia has also helped the company lower costs and improve margins. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Lam Research’s non-GAAP operating margin rose to 32.8%, up 210 basis points from last year, which is impressive, considering the tough conditions in the semiconductor market.\n\nLRCX’s Quarterly Numbers Confirm Strength\n\nLam Research’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 confirms its ability to execute well, even in uncertain times. Revenues rose 24.5% year over year to $4.72 billion, while non-GAAP EPS (adjusted for the stock split) jumped 33.5%. Strong demand from memory and logic customers, along with tight cost control, helped the company beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nLam Research’s consistent performance reinforces investor trust in its long-term business model and earnings stability.

The leader in smartphone chipsets faced declining revenues after the 5G upgrade cycle ran its course, and the demand for AI-enabled phones has so far not fostered a comparable growth cycle.\n\nPlus, Apple is on track to drop Qualcomm as a chipset provider in 2027, and the company's heavy exposure to China has weighed on the stock.\n\nStill, despite those challenges, investors may be overlooking a compelling reason to buy this value stock. Here's why.\n\nWhy investors should expect a Qualcomm comeback\n\nIn short, the reason to buy Qualcomm is its emerging business lines.\n\nIndeed, struggles in the smartphone chipset business could continue. However, Qualcomm has long anticipated a day when smartphones would become less critical. It has expanded into new business lines, including IoT, automotive, and more recently, the PC business. It also plans to design custom processors that will integrate with Nvidia's AI chips.\n\nThese moves are showing early signs of success. Although revenue growth was 17% year-over-year in the first half of fiscal 2025 (ended March 30), IoT revenue grew 31% during that period, and automotive revenue surged 60%. This is far above the 12% increase in the handset chip sales that still drive most of the company's revenue.\n\nWhat's more, Qualcomm's costs and expenses grew at levels closely approximating revenue growth. Still, its $6 billion in net income in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 rose by 18%, indicating the company's chip businesses are in an up-cycle. Although Qualcomm did not report numbers on its PC business, it expects to generate $4 billion in annual revenue from that business by fiscal 2029.\n\nFinally, despite double-digit profit growth, Qualcomm stock sells at a P/E ratio of 16. This indicates that investors have largely ignored the growth potential of this chip giant. However, with the rapid growth in Qualcomm's newer business lines, investors may want to take advantage of the low P/E ratio before more investors take notice.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:13:02.583649+00:00"}

Instead of manufacturing these processors, it earns revenue by licensing its designs to companies such as Samsung, Apple, and Qualcomm.\n\nDespite its importance to major industry players, it did not launch its initial public offering (IPO) until September 2023, and its value has nearly tripled since the original IPO price. Amid those gains, investors may wonder whether the stock will mint millionaires, or do its past gains make such a scenario unlikely?\n\nThe state of Arm stock and growth prospects\n\nWhile investors may assume that Qualcomm and Samsung, among others, thrive on in-house chip designs, the truth is that these companies could not design their mobile chipsets without Arm's help, highlighting the essential role it plays in the mobile phone industry.\n\nUnfortunately, despite playing this critical role in the industry, it may not make investors as wealthy as some may hope. The company came into existence in 1990, meaning it remained private for 33 years and built its current client base operating that way.\n\nConsequently, it had grown to a substantial size by the time it launched its IPO. When the stock came to the market, it debuted with a market cap exceeding $65 billion, and it has more than doubled to over $160 billion as of the time of this writing.\n\nTo put that into context, if you invested $10,000 today, and Arm somehow grew to the point that it matched Nvidia's market cap of $4 trillion (an unlikely prospect), your investment would increase 25-fold.\n\nThat would take the position's value to about $250,000, far short of \"millionaire\" status. For that investment to reach $1 million, the market cap would have to grow to about $16 trillion.\n\nTo add further context, Amazon had a market cap of less than $1 billion early in its history, leaving a massive runway for growth given today's $2.4 trillion market cap. Unfortunately, due to the timing of Arm's IPO and the size of the company, it significantly reduced the potential for an explosive growth runway for shareholders.\n\nThe financial case for Arm Holdings stock\n\nMoreover, one has to wonder whether Arm can justify the current lofty market cap given its financials. In fiscal 2025 (ended March 31), Arm reported a net income of $792 million from just over $4 billion in revenue. That amounted to 159% profit growth.\n\nAlso, analysts forecast net income growth of just 9% in the next fiscal year before reaccelerating to a 34% profit increase in fiscal 2027.\n\nStill, that leaves the stock with a 200 P/E ratio, and even when measured by the forward P/E ratio, the forward earnings multiple of 85 likely means investors have to pay a considerable premium for this stock.\n\nWill Arm Holdings stock help you become a millionaire?\n\nArm Holdings is undoubtedly an essential company whose stock offers the potential for considerable returns. However, the stock is unlikely to turn small investors into millionaires.\n\nThe most significant challenge to Arm minting millionaires is its size. At nearly $160 billion, it has already amassed considerable growth. Hence, to turn a $10,000 investment into $1 million, it would have to grow to a market cap that is quadruple the current record market cap for a public company.\n\nAdditionally, its current profit levels suggest that the stock's price has outpaced its fundamentals, making its short- and medium-term prospects for a rising stock price uncertain.\n\nConsidering the company's role in designing mobile processors, Arm is in a strong position to deliver shareholder gains in the long run. But unless you can invest considerably more than $10,000 in Arm stock, you should not expect that investment to reach a $1 million size.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:13:04.230492+00:00"}

This demonstrates a significant positive performance in the context of the broader market, despite it recently underperforming the US Semiconductor industry over the past year with a 28.8% return by the industry.\n\nThe affirmation of the company's dividend policy, coupled with its share repurchase program, could potentially foster positive sentiment towards its revenue and earnings forecasts. QUALCOMM is expected to advance its non-handset revenues, supported by its strategic expansions into automotive and IoT sectors. Analysts expect a revenue growth of 2.4% annually over the next three years, with earnings projected to reach US$11.6 billion by 2028, a modest increase from the current US$11.0 billion. Despite this outlook, the presence of competitive pressures and global trade uncertainties may challenge these projections.\n\nQUALCOMM's current share price of US$152.61 is slightly below the consensus analyst price target of US$174.88, indicating a potential upside of 14.60%. However, analyst opinions vary widely, reflecting differing views on QUALCOMM's performance trajectory within the competitive semiconductor landscape. The company's underperformance against the market's broader one-year return underlines potential caution in investor sentiment, although its long-term developments and strategic acquisitions may mitigate these short-term challenges. As QUALCOMM continues to leverage its robust product portfolio and strategic initiatives, its path to value realization remains a key focus for stakeholders.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:13:11.110364+00:00"}

The stock remains heavily shorted, but the bank believes improving fundamentals could flip sentiment.\n\n“Intel remains the most popular short but we believe the stock could squeeze higher during earnings given potential upside to EPS,” analyst Christopher Danely said in a Friday note.\n\nCiti cited lower capital expenditure (capex) and operating expenses (opex), along with likely upside from the PC end market—responsible for 60% of Intel’s sales—as key drivers. The bank’s estimates for Q2 are above consensus.\n\nBeyond Intel, Citi offered mixed views across the chip sector ahead of Q2 results. It expects AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) to trade higher before its earnings, boosted by investor enthusiasm for AI-related growth.\n\nWhile the Wall Street firm acknowledged that buyside expectations may be too high, it lifted its price target on AMD from $145 to $165 based on sentiment improvements.\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU), on the other hand, may struggle in the near term. Citi warned that the stock could remain weak due to “DRAM price flattening and fears of HBM oversupply.”\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) remains Citi’s top pick heading into earnings, with Danely noting the stock is under-owned.\n\n“We believe MCHP has the most upside potential to consensus estimates in our coverage,” he wrote, with Citi’s 2026 EPS forecast standing 38% above consensus.\n\nMeanwhile, ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) could face headwinds despite rising investor interest. Danely flagged ongoing risks in the company’s SiC and China low-end businesses, forecasting flat gross margins for the third quarter.\n\n“We believe the stock could trade lower after earnings due to elevated expectations,” the note said.\n\nCiti also remains cautious on Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), citing secular headwinds and the loss of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a customer, despite the stock being “surprisingly” widely owned.\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) was seen as well-positioned, with enough upside to sustain its momentum, especially on gross margins.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -1.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Qualcomm belongs, has gained 9.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nQualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $11.71 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.8 indicates a change of +0.8% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:13:19.799162+00:00"}

Interim management is committed to keeping the core strategy unchanged despite efforts to drive operational efficiency and agility. The company is emphasizing the diligent execution of operational goals to establish itself as a leading foundry. It is focusing on simplifying parts of its portfolio to unlock efficiencies and create value. Intel's innovative AI solutions are set to benefit the broader semiconductor ecosystem by driving down costs, improving performance and fostering an open, scalable AI environment. The company has witnessed healthy traction in AI PCs, which have taken the market by storm and remain firmly on track to ship more than 100 million by the end of 2025. Intel Xeon platforms have reportedly set the benchmark in 5G cloud-native core with substantial performance and power efficiency improvements, additional power-saving capabilities and easy-to-deploy software. This has triggered healthy demand trends from major telecom equipment manufacturers and independent software vendors to optimize and unleash proven power savings for a more sustainable future. However, Intel derives a significant part of its revenues from China. As Washington tightens restrictions on high-tech exports to China, Beijing has intensified its push for self-sufficiency in critical industries. This shift poses a dual challenge for Intel, as it faces potential market restrictions and increased competition from domestic chipmakers. The company is also lagging behind in the GPU and AI front compared to peers such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and AMD. Leading technology companies are reportedly piling up NVIDIA’s GPUs to build clusters of computers for their AI work, leading to exponential revenue growth.\n\nIntel Corporation INTC and Qualcomm Incorporated QCOM are two premier semiconductor firms investing heavily in connectivity and edge computing, with both focusing on AI (artificial intelligence) and advanced chip technologies. Intel, reportedly the world’s largest semiconductor company and primary supplier of microprocessors and chipsets, is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by moving into data-centric businesses, such as AI and autonomous driving. The foundry operating model is a key component of the company's strategy and is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability and focus on costs and efficiency. Qualcomm’s offering includes high-performance, low-power chip designs for mobile devices, PCs, XR (Extended Reality), automotive, wearable, robotics, connectivity and AI use cases. The company boasts a comprehensive intellectual property portfolio comprising 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies. With the growing proliferation of AI in PCs, smartphones, automotive and IoT applications, both Intel and Qualcomm are steadily advancing their semiconductor portfolios to bolster their competitive edge. Let us analyze the competitive strengths and weaknesses of the companies to understand who is better positioned to capitalize on emerging market trends.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Case for Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm is well-positioned to meet its long-term revenue targets driven by solid 5G traction, greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream. The company is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. Qualcomm is witnessing healthy traction in EDGE networking, which helps transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets. The automotive telematics and connectivity platforms, digital cockpit and C-V2X solutions are also fueling emerging automotive industry trends such as the growth of connected vehicles, the transformation of the in-car experience and vehicle electrification.\n\n\n\nThe company is strengthening its foothold in the mobile chipsets market with innovative product launches. It had extended its Snapdragon G Series portfolio with the addition of next-generation gaming chipsets, Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 and Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 chips. Samsung, one of the major smartphone manufacturers, has deployed the Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for its premium S25, S25 Plus and S25 Ultra devices. It is also placing a strong emphasis on developing advanced chipsets for the emerging AI PC market. The company has inked agreements to acquire MovianAI to augment its efforts in fundamental AI research.\n\n\n\nDespite efforts to ramp up its AI initiatives, Qualcomm has been facing tough competition from Intel in the AI PC market. Shift in the share among OEMs at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from the Snapdragon platform. The company is also facing stiff competition from Samsung’s Exynos processors in the premium smartphone market, while MediaTek is gaining market share in the mid-range and budget smartphone market.

Here's the Best of the Bunch.", "summary": "Buffett is not known as a technology investor, but even his portfolio has some exposure to the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/14/warren-buffett-has-658-billion-invested-in-these-4/", "published_at": "2025-07-14T10:15:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Buffett is not known as a technology investor, but even his portfolio has some exposure to the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend.\n\nWarren Buffett did not build Berkshire Hathaway into a market-beating financial services powerhouse by investing in high-risk growth stocks. As a value investor, Buffett is a master at identifying quality businesses that have been discounted by the broader market.\n\nFor these reasons, technology stocks have seldom earned a spot in Buffett's portfolio. And with the stock market trading at all-time highs and valuations -- particularly in the technology sector -- becoming ever-more stretched, it's surprising to see that Buffett has any exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) whatsoever.\n\nLet's explore four AI stocks that have garnered interest from Buffett and his team. From there, I'll detail how the Oracle of Omaha has been investing in these companies, and reveal which one I see as the top pick.\n\nWhat AI stocks are in Buffett's portfolio?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's portfolio holds a number of stocks in the financial services and consumer defensive industries. Many of these companies such as Coca-Cola, Moody's, Visa, Mastercard, Capital One, and Constellation Brands stand to benefit from rising investment in AI, but none provides direct exposure to the upside artificial intelligence presents.\n\nThe only two direct AI investments held in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio are Apple and Amazon (AMZN 0.08%). Despite trimming his exposure to the iPhone maker considerably over the past year, Apple remains Berkshire's largest position -- currently worth about $63.6 billion. Amazon is a considerably smaller position, worth roughly $2.2 billion at current market prices.\n\nThrough a series of acquisitions, New England Asset Management (NEAM) became a subsidiary of Berkshire in the late 1990s. While Buffett does not necessarily influence the decision-making over at NEAM, stocks that are owned by the fund are technically a part of his portfolio, too.\n\nNEAM owns a number of AI stocks, but the two that stuck out to me are Qualcomm and Cisco Systems. To be fair, these are relatively small positions -- totaling only $15 million between the two of them.\n\nAs these trends illustrate, Cisco and Qualcomm trade at significant discounts to other chip and AI infrastructure players on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) basis -- potentially signaling a good value relative to their peers in the AI landscape.\n\nHow has Buffett and NEAM been investing in these stocks?\n\nAs I alluded to, Berkshire has been reducing its exposure to Apple for quite some time. According to 13F filings, Berkshire has sold more than 489 million shares of Apple since the first quarter of 2024 -- trimming its position by 62%. By contrast, Berkshire's Amazon position has remained unchanged.\n\nDuring the first quarter, NEAM reduced its Cisco position by 12% and increased its exposure to Qualcomm by 1%.\n\nWhich AI stock is the best of the bunch in Buffett's portfolio?\n\nI wouldn't read too much into NEAM's decisions to trim Cisco and add to Qualcomm. Both positions are small relative to NEAM's overall portfolio size.\n\nMoreover, while Cisco and Qualcomm each have the opportunity to benefit from AI, I think their upside is limited compared to other opportunities. The reason I say that is because their respective businesses are more specialized and niche; therefore, their growth prospects may not be as attractive as other multiplatform companies such as Nvidia or Broadcom.\n\nRegarding Apple, Buffett's decision to sell when he did looks like a genius move in hindsight. For more than a year now, Apple's foray into the AI landscape has been quite muted. While other tech titans such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Oracle, and Amazon have been striking strategic partnerships left and right with OpenAI and Anthropic and making splashy acquisitions, Apple has largely remained on the sidelines -- calling into question how robust the company's future growth really is.\n\nDespite its relatively small exposure, I see Berkshire's investment in Amazon as its best AI stock overall. In addition to Buffett, Amazon has earned spots in Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Portfolio and is a core AI position in Cathie Wood's exchange-traded funds (ETF) over at Ark Invest.\n\nAmazon has already been leveraging AI in its cloud services platform -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- and is currently integrating AI-powered robotics to help bring a new wave of efficiency to the company's warehouse and fulfillment center logistics platforms.\n\nI think Amazon has only scratched the surface in how AI can transform its ecosystem, and I see the stock as a compelling value for investors with a long-term time horizon, such as Buffett.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:13:33.770707+00:00"}

The company's earnings report is expected on July 30, 2025. In that report, analysts expect Qualcomm to post earnings of $2.68 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 15.02%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $10.35 billion, reflecting a 10.24% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nQCOM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $11.71 per share and revenue of $43.54 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +14.58% and +11.76%, respectively.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Qualcomm. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained steady. At present, Qualcomm boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Qualcomm has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.59 right now. This denotes a discount relative to the industry average Forward P/E of 28.55.\n\nWe can additionally observe that QCOM currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.66. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Semiconductors industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.62 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

Several manufacturers, such as Xiaomi, ASUS, HONOR and Oneplus, have utilized Qualcomm’s most advanced chipset. Moreover, Samsung has also deployed the Snapdragon 8 Elite in its flagship S25 series earlier in 2025. Healthy demand in the premium smartphone segment is driving growth in the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) segment. In the first quarter, revenues from the QCT segment increased to $9.47 billion from $8.03 billion in the year ago quarter. In 2025, handset revenue is expected to reach $27.7 billion, suggesting 11.3% year-over-year growth. The company’s Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chipset is also gaining popularity in the mid-range smartphone vertical. Major Chinese smartphone makers HONOR and VIVO have already selected the chip. However, intensifying competition in the mobile phone chipset market is hurting Qualcomm’s profit. The company is facing competition from low-cost chip manufacturers like MediaTek and Rockchip in the mid-range handset vertical. Moreover, long-term clients like Apple, Inc. AAPL are moving to in-house chip development, which is hindering revenue growth. Apple is using its leading-edge, high-performing chip M4 Ultra to power its iPad Pro. Apple has also replaced Qualcomm’s RF modem in its newest iPhone 16e handset with a C1 modem, made in-house. Qualcomm is also facing competition from Broadcom, Inc. AVGO. Broadcom is a prominent supplier of RF Components to leading smartphone makers. The company's strong relationships with leading OEMs across multiple target markets have helped it to gain key insights into the requirements of customers.

While the Z Flip 7 gets a larger cover screen, which Samsung refers to as its FlexWindow, that allows you to see more of the apps you’re running.\n\nBoth Android-powered phones also come loaded with plenty of artificial intelligence software, including Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Gemini assistant, as well as Samsung’s own AI capabilities.\n\nBut like Samsung’s prior foldable phones, the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 have one shortcoming: their price. The Z Fold 7 starts at $1,999, while the Z Flip 7 starts at $1,099. That will likely keep a good number of customers from giving the foldables a shot, which is a shame given how much more refined they are than previous versions of the Fold and Flip.\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 slims down\n\nSamsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7. (Image: Howley) · Howley\n\nSo far, AI tools haven’t proven to be much of a selling point for smartphones. Customers are still more interested in the physical improvements companies make to their devices, including making them thinner while outfitting them with bigger displays, better batteries, and sharper cameras. And Samsung did just that with the Z Fold 7.\n\nWhen folded, the Z Fold 7 measures 8.9 millimeters thick, about the same thickness as Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra. And when unfolded, each side is just 4.2 millimeters thick, or just a hair thicker than a USB-C port.\n\nThe Z Fold 7 feels like a normal phone when folded. (Image: Howley) · Howley\n\nThat reduction in size is critical for Samsung to prove that foldable phones, and their larger interior displays, don’t mean having to also carry around an electronic brick all the time. As someone who’s been using the Fold since the company first debuted the line in 2019, this is easily the closest to a normal smartphone in size and weight.\n\nIt helps that Samsung also increased the width of the Fold’s front display, making it more comfortable for firing off text messages or replying to your boss’s 6:00 a.m. Slacks. Inside, the Z Fold 7 gets a larger 8-inch display, up from 7.6 inches, for everything from streaming Netflix to running multiple apps and working in Excel.\n\nThe Z Fold 7 is incredible slim when unfolded. (Image: Howley) · Howley\n\nSamsung is also finally bringing its top-of-the-line smartphone cameras to the Fold, outfitting the Z Fold 7 with a 200-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-MP ultra-wide camera, and a 10-MP telephoto camera with up to 3x optical zoom.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:13:46.403253+00:00"}

The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Qualcomm belongs, has gained 15.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nQualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.71 points to a change of +14.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.82 indicates a change of +1% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:14:20.155070+00:00"}

AI has been used in various forms going back to the turn of the century for companies like Google parent Alphabet, and others. The generative AI boom is a much more recent breakthrough, and it is driving considerable investment returns for companies like Nvidia and Palantir Technologies.\n\nThe AI-based breakthroughs continue, and that is inspiring gains in other AI-driven tech stocks. Such gains may have just begun for one particular tech stock.\n\nA stock positioned to benefit from AI\n\nThe stock that is well-positioned to start benefiting from the latest AI changes is Qualcomm (QCOM 3.89%).\n\nAdmittedly, Qualcomm does not look much like a winner in AI. It released the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the fall of 2023, empowering users to incorporate AI into their smartphones. Although revenue growth in handset sales eventually returned to double-digit levels, AI has failed to inspire the level of increased sales that Qualcomm experienced when users wanted to upgrade to 5G.\n\nMoreover, after years of failed attempts, Apple appears finally ready to replace Qualcomm's chips in the iPhone with chips of its own design. Assuming Apple does not reverse course, Qualcomm is set to lose one of its largest customers.\n\nHowever, it may hearten investors to know that Qualcomm has long prepared for the day when it will depend less on smartphones.\n\nIts Internet-of-Things (IoT) segment has applied its communications abilities to develop end-to-end IoT solutions for applications such as smart homes and industrial automation. Additionally, its communications and AI advances could make it a leader in self-driving through its automotive segment. In the first six months of fiscal 2025 (ended March 30), revenue for the IoT and automotive segments increased at annual rates of 31% and 60%, respectively, significantly outpacing the 12% growth in the handset segment over the same period.\n\nFurthermore, Qualcomm has developed PC chips, making it a competitor to AMD and Intel. In the data center market, it has also partnered with Nvidia to develop custom chips that can support AI workloads within data centers.\n\nEffects on financials\n\nThese recent advancements appear to be helping Qualcomm's top and bottom lines more than its stock. In the first two quarters of fiscal 2025, revenue of nearly $23 billion increased by 17% compared with the same period in fiscal 2024. During the same period last year, revenue had risen by only 3% annually.\n\nIn the first six months of the year, Qualcomm kept a lid on operating expense growth. Still, with lower investment income and rising income tax expenses, its $6 billion in net income grew by 18% yearly.\n\nNonetheless, such improvements have not swayed investors. Over the last 12 months, Qualcomm stock dropped by almost 20%, though it is up 27% from the lows it reached in April.\n\nAdditionally, the stock sells at a 16 P/E ratio. Although that is not much lower than the average P/E ratio of 20 over the last five years, the earnings multiple suggests a lack of investor optimism about Qualcomm stock. And yet, this reasonable valuation could inspire a bull market in Qualcomm stock. Assuming its non-handset segments continue to grow at a rapid rate, it could start Qualcomm stock on a long-term growth trend.\n\nThe growth prospects of Qualcomm stock\n\nConsidering the state of Qualcomm's business and stock, it has real potential to begin a long-term growth trend. Admittedly, a lackluster AI growth cycle and the likelihood of losing Apple as a customer have soured some investors on Qualcomm. However, the company has returned to revenue and earnings growth, and its burgeoning IoT and automotive segments deserve significant credit for this surge.\n\nUltimately, such improvements should not lead to a falling stock price and a rock-bottom valuation. Once Qualcomm's role in AI becomes clearer, such conditions could inspire the beginning of a long-term uptrend in Qualcomm stock.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:14:21.686673+00:00"}

Only one of the Fund’s technology holdings posted a positive quarterly return – QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) – making this a somewhat hollow outperformance. Qualcomm is a “value tech” company which has enviable cash flows but we believe has been consistently underappreciated in the market for its technology licensing business, which has frequently been targeted for legal action by some of its major customers. However, we believe it continues to prove its best-in-class technology and, despite companies attempting to circumvent Qualcomm, we continue to see a long-term position in the wireless technology space for the company.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

However, its current valuation warrants a closer look.\n\nARM trades at nearly 85X forward 12-month earnings, a significant premium to the broader semiconductor industry average of 33X. While the company’s strategic relevance is undeniable, the elevated multiple reflects expectations that may take time to materialize in financial results.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nArm-based chips are shipped at an impressive scale, over 30 billion units annually, yet the company generates relatively modest revenues per chip. In fiscal 2024, Arm reported $4 billion in total revenue, with $2 billion derived from royalties. This places the average royalty rate at about 6.5 cents per chip, while overall per-chip revenue stands at approximately 13 cents.\n\nArm’s strength lies in its broad ecosystem and power-efficient designs, which position it well for long-term trends in AI, IoT, and mobile computing. However, its current revenue model, driven primarily by low per-unit royalties, indicates a need for more substantial near-term monetization.\n\nInvestors may want to consider locking in gains while the stock remains priced for perfection. Further upside may depend on a clearer path to stronger revenue and earnings growth.\n\nBeyond ARM: NVIDIA and Qualcomm are Better Valued\n\nWhile ARM’s valuation may prompt caution, investors looking for semiconductor exposure with clearer financial traction might consider NVIDIA NVDA and Qualcomm QCOM. NVIDIA, with a forward 12-month P/E of 32, continues to dominate the AI accelerator space, with strong revenue and earnings growth, driven by surging demand for its GPUs. The company’s leadership in AI infrastructure makes NVIDIA a favorite among growth-oriented investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Qualcomm, trading at just 13x forward earnings, offers a more diversified chip portfolio spanning smartphones, automotive, and IoT. Its solid royalty business and increasing footprint in AI-powered edge devices position Qualcomm for steady expansion. Both NVIDIA and Qualcomm have demonstrated the ability to monetize their innovations more effectively than ARM, making them compelling alternatives.\n\nARM’s Price Performance, Estimates\n\nThe stock has surged 28% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 11% rally.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARM’s earnings has been on the decline over the past 60 days.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:14:33.311824+00:00"}

This was a 37% increase from Q3 sales of $6.81 billion in the comparative quarter and comfortably exceeded estimates of $8.83 billion by 5.27%.\n\nMicron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) business stood out, with sales of $1.5 billion marking nearly 50% sequential growth, fueled by demand for AI computing applications. HBM sales helped drive record DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) revenue of $7.1 billion, as Data Center-specific revenue more than doubled from the surge in memory demand for AI workloads.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron’s Q3 EPS & Other Quarterly Highlights\n\nOn the bottom line, Micron’s Q3 earnings skyrocketed 208% to $1.91 per share ($2.18 billion) from EPS of $0.62 a year ago and crushed expectations of $1.59 a share by 20%.\n\nImproved pricing and product mix were the main drivers, with Micron vanquishing a 39% gross margin, compared to 28% in the prior year quarter. Other noteworthy highlights included a six-year peak in free cash flow at $1.95 billion.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron’s Positive Guidance\n\nSupported by AI momentum, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra stated the company is on track to deliver record revenue for the full fiscal year. Notably, Micron expects Q4 sales to be $10.7 billion (+/-$300 million), which came in above the current Zacks Consensus of $9.9 billion. Even better, Micron’s forecast for Q4 EPS of $2.50 (+/- 15 cents) was well above expectations of $2.02.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere was a lot to like about Micron’s strong Q3 results, and there could very well be more upside for MU shares, which are up nearly +50% this year. However, following such an extensive year-to-date rally, Micron stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). To that point, more upside will largely depend on what will hopefully be a positive trend of earnings estimate revisions (EPS) in the coming weeks, given Micron’s AI growth and reassuring guidance.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:14:37.428221+00:00"}

Find out in our full research report, it’s free.\n\nWhy Does QCOM Stock Spark Debate?\n\nHaving been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\n\nTwo Positive Attributes:\n\n1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Shows Strong Momentum\n\nA company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last five years, Qualcomm grew its sales at a solid 11.2% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth surpassed the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n\nQualcomm Quarterly Revenue\n\n2. Excellent Free Cash Flow Margin Boosts Reinvestment Potential\n\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\n\nQualcomm has shown terrific cash profitability, and if sustainable, puts it in an advantageous position to invest in new products, return capital to investors, and consolidate the market during industry downturns. The company’s free cash flow margin was among the best in the semiconductor sector, averaging an eye-popping 30.5% over the last two years.\n\nQualcomm Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin\n\nOne Reason to be Careful:\n\nProjected Revenue Growth Is Slim\n\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite.\n\nOver the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect Qualcomm’s revenue to rise by 2.5%, close to its 11.2% annualized growth for the past five years. This projection is underwhelming and implies its newer products and services will not lead to better top-line performance yet. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nQualcomm has huge potential even though it has some open questions, but at $156 per share (or 13.2× forward P/E), is now the time to initiate a position?

And seeing that it accounts for the bulk of Qualcomm’s CDMA Technologies (QCT) revenues (73%), the analysts see limited near-term catalysts for the stock. The analysts also point to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a factor that poses risks to Qualcomm’s bottom line. Apple is working on in-house modems, which means lower sales for Qualcomm. The analysts forecast Apple’s contribution to Qualcomm’s handset revenues to plummet to 6% in FY2027 compared to 15% in FY2024.\n\nDespite the lowered target, BofA analysts believe the stock is still a “Buy.” In other words, the firm sees enough upside potential to justify Qualcomm’s shares.

(CRWV) Skyrocketed On Tuesday\n\nA close up of a circuit board, its microchips creating a powerful computing system.\n\nQualcomm’s $2.4 billion acquisition of UK-based Alphawave marks a strategic pivot into high-performance AI and data center infrastructure, reflecting the company’s intent to expand well beyond its legacy in smartphone chips.\n\nThe deal, which includes both cash and stock and carries a striking 96% premium to Alphawave’s share price as of March 31, signals Qualcomm’s confidence in the long-term value of AI infrastructure. Alphawave’s core technology—high-speed chip interconnects—enables faster data movement across AI systems, a capability crucial for supporting the computational demands of next-gen AI workloads. If successfully integrated, Alphawave could contribute high-margin IP revenue, helping Qualcomm diversify into enterprise silicon and improving overall business quality.\n\nThis move comes as AI infrastructure becomes one of the most competitive and lucrative battlegrounds in the semiconductor sector. For investors, this is less about immediate earnings and more about Qualcomm locking in a foundation for sustained relevance and growth in a rapidly evolving AI landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, the construction industry—long resistant to automation—is undergoing its own AI-driven transformation. Dutch startup Monumental is using AI-powered bricklaying robots to tackle urban density challenges, while U.S.-based ICON leverages 3D printing to build homes and even lunar structures at unprecedented speed. Built Robotics is automating excavation and piling work for energy projects, and Australia’s FBR has piloted its rapid bricklaying robot in Florida.\n\nThese innovations point to a broader shift where automation addresses labor shortages, cost pressures, and space constraints. If scalable, the economic and societal benefits could be immense, especially in housing-constrained regions.\n\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Qualcomm from Christopher Kirincic on Substack, which emphasized its compelling valuation, steady licensing cash flow, and expanding presence in automotive and AI edge computing. In contrast, the Investing Intel thesis highlights Qualcomm’s strategic pivot into AI infrastructure through its Alphawave acquisition, signaling a longer-term bet on high-performance enterprise silicon beyond its mobile legacy.

The company is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. The recent introduction of Qualcomm X85 5G Modem-RF, powered by Qualcomm’s 5G AI Processor, has taken the market by storm by delivering one of the fastest, battery efficient and consistent 5G connectivity to Android users. The company is strengthening its foothold in the mobile chipsets market with innovative product launches. It had extended its Snapdragon G Series portfolio with the addition of next-generation gaming chipsets, Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 and Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 chips. Qualcomm is also placing strong emphasis on developing advanced chipsets for the emerging market of AI PCs. The strategy is aimed at moving beyond the slowing smartphone industry, which is its primary breadwinner. The Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI desktops and laptops is the fourth such product in the Snapdragon X processor line, following the successful launch of the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core, Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite series. Despite efforts to ramp up its AI initiatives, Qualcomm has been facing tough competition from Intel Corporation INTC in the AI PC market. Shift in the share among original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) at the premium tier has reduced Qualcomm's near-term opportunity to sell integrated chipsets from the Snapdragon platform. The company is also facing stiff competition from Samsung’s Exynos processors in the premium smartphone market, while MediaTek is gaining market share in the mid-range and budget smartphone market. Competition is also likely to come from formidable rivals like Broadcom and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. Qualcomm’s extensive operations in China are further likely to be significantly affected by the U.S.-China trade hostilities.\n\nQualcomm Technologies Inc. QCOM and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD are premier chip manufacturing firms competing in the mobile, PC and data center markets, with a focus on AI (artificial intelligence) and advanced chip technologies. Qualcomm’s offering includes high-performance, low-power chip designs for mobile devices, PCs, XR (Extended Reality), automotive, wearable, robotics, connectivity and AI use cases. The company boasts a comprehensive intellectual property portfolio comprising 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies. Advanced Micro has strengthened its position in the semiconductor market, thanks to its evolution from a purebred consumer-PC chip provider to an enterprise-focused company. Its processors are primarily powered by the company's proprietary \"Zen\" CPU and \"Vega\" GPU architectures. The company’s acquisition of Xilinx has helped in expanding into multiple embedded markets. AMD now offers Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. With growing AI proliferation in PCs, smartphones, automotive and IoT applications, both Qualcomm and Advanced Micro are steadily advancing their semiconductor portfolio to bolster their competitive edge. Let us analyze in depth the competitive strengths and weaknesses of the companies to understand who is in a better position to maximize gains from the emerging market trends.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Case for Advanced Micro\n\nAMD is strengthening its footprint in the AI market through an expanding portfolio. The latest MI300 series accelerator family boosts its competitive position in the generative AI space. The accelerator is based on AMD CDNA 3 accelerator architecture and supports up to 192 GB of HBM3 memory, enabling efficient running of large language model training (up to 80 billion parameters) and inference for generative AI workloads. It is also benefiting from strong enterprise adoption and expanded cloud deployments.\n\n\n\nIn addition, strength in 7-nanometer-based processors is expected to strengthen the company's competitive position in the commercial and server market against Intel. AMD is currently leveraging Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's 7 nm process technology, which is enabling it to deliver its advanced 7 nm chips faster to market. AMD Radeon RX 7900 series chiplet design combines 5 nm and 6 nm process nodes, each optimized for specific chips in the GPU.\n\n\n\nHowever, in the traditional computing market, which still generates a chunk of its revenues, AMD is up against Intel's strong market position. With Intel systems so well entrenched, there is an obvious preference for system integrators to choose Intel processors over AMD. Moreover, AMD faces significant competition from NVIDIA in the GPU market. AMD has had relatively greater success in the mobile segment, and its current product lineup indicates that this focus will continue. However, competition in the mobile segment is likely to accelerate, with more ARM-based devices coming on the market.\n\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for QCOM & AMD?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Qualcomm’s 2025 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 11.8% and 14.6%, respectively. The EPS estimates have been trending southward on average over the past 60 days.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Advanced Micro’s 2025 sales suggests year-over-year growth of 23.1%, while that for EPS implies a rise of 18.4%. The EPS estimates have been trending southward over the past 60 days.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation of QCOM & AMD\n\nOver the past year, Qualcomm has declined 27.7% against the industry’s growth of 12.5%. Advanced Micro has lost 21.5% over the same period.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQualcomm looks more attractive than Advanced Micro from a valuation standpoint. Going by the price/earnings ratio, Qualcomm’s shares currently trade at 12.95 forward earnings, significantly lower than 26.72 for Advanced Micro.\n\n\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQCOM or AMD: Which is a Better Pick?\n\nQualcomm and Advanced Micro carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n\n\nBoth companies expect their sales and profits to improve in 2025. Advanced Micro has shown steady revenue and EPS growth for years, while Qualcomm has been facing a bumpy road. With a better price performance and healthy long-term earnings growth expectations of 24.5%, Advanced Micro is relatively better placed than Qualcomm (long-term earnings growth expectations of 8.2%), although the former is a bit expensive in terms of valuation. Consequently, Advanced Micro seems to be a better investment option at the moment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But, my next guest has some alternative ways to play artificial intelligence. I'm going to bring in Dan Newman who is the Futurum CEO. Great to have you here back in studio with us.\n\n00:15 Dan Newman\n\nHey Brad, good to see you.\n\n00:17 Speaker A\n\nSo, let's talk about this because a lot of people have already piled into Mag 7, but you believe that there are other places that are non Mag 7 that they could find some exposure to generative AI and this broader kind of thesis that's driven the market for the past two years.\n\n00:30 Dan Newman\n\nYeah, I mean there's been nothing that has, you know, deemed more attention than AI. You've seen just the news in the last couple of days, whether it's Microsoft wanting to, or sorry, meta offering hundreds of millions of dollars to potential researchers to join their AI talent team. Or, you know, you saw Marvell came out yesterday with the custom AI Silicon roadmap and their stock is popping, we'll probably talk a little bit about that. Um, but you're seeing it really across the board. And then of course so many people have kind of felt like, well, did I miss Nvidia? And so the the question I get asked most by, you know, by clients, by the by retail investors and why we basically launched the Futurum AI 15, which is the extended list beyond is what else is out there besides maybe Nvidia, Microsoft, and meta? What are the plays, you know? And so, you hear about kind of what are the difference difference makers? So for instance, uh, companies like Avago, you know, Broadcom. Um, you know there's a $500 billion TAM, we believe, in the next four years for custom AI Silicon.\n\n01:52 Speaker A\n\nYeah.\n\n01:53 Dan Newman\n\nUm, Nvidia's going to get a lot of that, you know, Nvidia gets 92% of that market right now, we believe. Right. But they're not going to keep 92% in our opinion. They're probably going to fall to maybe 80%, 70%. So it still means Nvidia, by the way, can triple to $300 billion. There's going to be $100 billion that's going to go into custom. And so we have Avago, for instance, at as our number two name to play, because that $100 billion opportunity, that sits with the Google custom chips they're doing, sits with custom chips that companies like Open AI are planning to do. So that's one of the plays. Of course, you're seeing, uh, Brad, TSMC. TSMC, you know, people think about it as a foundry, and of course, it's a very big name and there's a lot of dollars invested in it right now, but people don't always make that connection that whether it's Nvidia making chips, meta making chips, Microsoft, and Amazon doing their custom chips, all of them are dependent right now on TSMC. And as much as I think the US needs a strong Intel, we aren't there yet. So, right now, TSMC has all the pricing power. So it sits at the very top of our list. And then there's some eclectic names, I'll pause here, but basically there's eclectic names like Oracle, that we put on there. You saw what a pop they've gotten, but they've absolutely nailed this AI transformation and they're in a perfect position. And just yesterday, XAI and Oracle made a big announcement together that they're going to be using X Oracle's infrastructure to train XAI models.\n\n04:11 Speaker A\n\nRight.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:15:18.358712+00:00"}

Its 2021 acquisition of Nuvia marked a strategic re-entry into the high-performance computing space, laying the groundwork for broader ambitions.\n\nOne example is the Stargate Project, backed by President Trump, which aims to channel $500 billion into AI infrastructure over the next few years. In this context, it’s no surprise that major tech companies are aggressively positioning themselves to capitalize on what may be one of the most transformative growth opportunities of the decade.\n\nThis surge is driven not only by the widespread adoption of generative AI and enterprise applications but also by growing geopolitical urgency. Many now view semiconductors as strategic assets—comparable to nuclear technology—prompting nations to make significant investments to secure technological leadership.\n\nInvestment in AI infrastructure is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. Microsoft (MSFT) has announced plans to spend $80 billion on AI data centers in 2025, while Amazon (AMZN) is committing over $100 billion to similar initiatives. According to McKinsey & Company, global data center investments could reach $6.7 trillion by 2030 to meet the soaring demand for compute power.\n\nIt also marks Qualcomm’s second significant acquisition in this arena, following its purchase of Nuvia, as the company seeks to reestablish a foothold in high-performance computing. With a growing range of revenue streams beyond its traditional mobile business, Qualcomm’s strategic pivot into AI and infrastructure markets strengthens the long-term investment case, despite the competitive landscape.\n\nQualcomm’s (QCOM) $2.4 billion acquisition of Alphawave highlights the company’s renewed push into the rapidly expanding AI data center market. This move follows Qualcomm’s earlier efforts in the data center CPU space, which were ultimately scaled back due to cost-cutting measures, legal challenges, and intense competition.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Alphawave acquisition provides Qualcomm with critical high-speed wired connectivity and chiplet technologies—key components for scaling AI infrastructure. These advancements position Qualcomm to compete more directly with industry heavyweights like Intel and AMD in the rapidly evolving data center and AI computing markets.\n\nDiversifying Revenue Beyond Handsets\n\nQualcomm aims to generate $22 billion in non-handset revenue by fiscal year 2029—a sharp increase from the $8.3 billion recorded last year. This target implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%, highlighting the company’s intention to diversify beyond its core mobile business.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, QCOM reported a 17% increase in revenue to $11.7 billion, driven by strength in its chipset (QCT) and licensing (QTL) divisions. The company delivered strong profitability, with EPS of $2.83, representing a 15% year-over-year increase.\n\nSegments such as automotive, IoT, PCs, and extended reality (AR/VR) are expected to drive this growth. Diversification is especially critical for Qualcomm, which has historically been heavily reliant on the smartphone market, a sector vulnerable to risks such as OEMs developing in-house chips. Broadening its revenue base could help reduce that dependency and position Qualcomm for more balanced, long-term growth.\n\nNaturally, ambitious projections remain just that—projections. Qualcomm’s success in AI infrastructure is far from guaranteed, given the intense competition from both established players, such as AMD and Intel, and emerging powerhouses like Amazon and Microsoft. In this context, Qualcomm can be viewed as a dark horse—an underdog with significant potential, but one that must execute flawlessly to gain meaningful ground in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market.\n\nWhat is the Target Price for QCOM Stock in 2025?\n\nOn Wall Street, Qualcomm sports a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on eight Buy, eight Hold, and one Sell rating in the past three months. QCOM’s average stock price target of $177.92 implies a 13% upside potential over the next 12 months.\n\nFollowing its acquisition of Alphawave, Fang Boon Foo, an analyst at DBS, maintained a Buy rating on QCOM with a price target of $180 per share. The analyst noted that the Alphawave acquisition “supports Qualcomm’s efforts to capitalize on the expanding 5G market across various segments such as premium handsets, automotive, IoT, and edge networking, with strong partnerships with industry leaders like Apple, Samsung, Mercedes, and BMW further solidifying its competitive advantage.”\n\nHowever, not everyone is wearing rose-colored glasses when it comes to Qualcomm. For instance, Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo has a Sell rating on the stock. He pointed out that the Alphawave acquisition came at a significant premium of 96% over Alphawave’s last closing price.\n\nIn addition, “while Alphawave’s technology could complement Qualcomm’s existing CPU and NPU designs, the acquisition’s small scale relative to Qualcomm’s overall operations may not significantly impact its financial performance in the near term,” the analyst said.\n\nQualcomm Bets Big on AI Infrastructure With Alphawave Deal\n\nQualcomm’s $2.4 billion acquisition of Alphawave marks a strategic move to establish a more substantial presence in the rapidly expanding AI data center market. While the price tag may appear steep, it likely reflects the unique and critical value of Alphawave’s high-speed connectivity and chiplet technology, complementary assets to Qualcomm’s Oryon CPU and Hexagon NPU processors.\n\nThat said, reaching the company’s ambitious goal of $22 billion in non-handset revenue will be no small feat. Qualcomm lacks a proven track record in scaling AI infrastructure, and capturing market share from entrenched incumbents will be a significant challenge.\n\nStill, from an investor’s standpoint, the acquisition positions Qualcomm as a more diversified, full-stack player in a high-growth industry. It also reduces dependence on the cyclical mobile market. While regulatory and execution risks remain, Qualcomm’s calculated expansion into AI infrastructure is a meaningful step forward—and a reason for cautious optimism.\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:15:27.354459+00:00"}

But that narrative is starting to change, and fast. The company is quietly building a strong presence in AI infrastructure, automotive tech, and industrial IoT, even though the market still seems to price it like it's stuck in the phone cycle.\n\nIn fiscal Q2 2025, Qualcomm pulled in $10.8 billion in revenue, a solid 15% jump from a year ago. Handset sales were up 12%, but the real standout growth came from the auto and IoT segments, which soared 59% and 27%, respectively. Together, these now make up over a quarter of Qualcomm's core chip business. That's a big deal for a company once so closely tied to phones.\n\nThe profitability side of the story looks strong, too. The QCT (chip) unit earned $2.86 billion before taxes, a 25% increase, with margins rising to 30%. Qualcomm also made some strategic moves on the AI front, acquiring companies like Edge Impulse and FocusAI to enhance its edge AI capabilities.\n\nIt had some points of pressure. The gross margin fell slightly to 55%, primarily due to a shift in product mix. However, Qualcomm maintained the R&D expenditure at 20% of sales, indicating its continued long-term investment. In addition, free cash flow totaled $6.65 billion in the first half of the year, and the firm paid out all those funds to shareholders through cash buybacks (1.7 billion) and dividends (close to $ 1 billion).\n\nThe licensing revenue remained unchanged at $ 1.32 billion. Qualcomm also signed licenses with Chinese OEMs, and Huawei's replacement came down to zero. Nevertheless, the licensing margins were quite healthy at 70%.\n\nThe stock continues to sell at only 13 times forward earnings, even after the great numbers and a clear shift in business strategy. That is very low compared to peers in the industry. It implies that investors are not yet enlightened about the entire transformation that Qualcomm has undergone to become a much larger company than simply a Smartphone chipmaker.\n\nIs QCOM Stock a Buy?\n\nNot Just Phones Anymore: Qualcomm AI and Auto Bets Are Paying Off\n\nBased on the one year price targets offered by 31 analysts, the average target price for Qualcomm Inc is $176.19 with a high estimate of $270.00 and a low estimate of $140.00. The average target implies a upside of +14.07% from the current price of $154.46.\n\nBased on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Qualcomm Inc in one year is $160.27, suggesting a upside of +3.76% from the current price of $154.46.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:15:29.358968+00:00"}

{"id": "04a4fe6f-3dcc-3f24-83fe-4a15f8476907", "ticker": "QCOM", "title": "3 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy With $200 Right Now", "summary": "Finding value in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be tough, especially with just $200. These three options meet the mark, though.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/14/no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-ai-growth-stock/", "published_at": "2025-06-14T09:55:00Z", "source": "Motley Fool", "text": "Finding value in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be tough, especially with just $200. These three options meet the mark, though.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the most-talked-about topics on Wall Street over the last two and a half years. More than 40% of S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.13%) companies have cited \"AI\" on their earnings calls for five straight quarters, according to FactSet Insight. Practically every business is looking at how the recent innovations and influx of spending on AI can impact just about every aspect of their business.\n\nBut while AI is providing a ton of growth for some, it can be a cost center without a clear payoff for others. However, even if a company falls into the former camp, investors should be wary about overpaying for growth that could slow down as the business scales.\n\nFinding good value in AI stocks isn't easy. And if you have a limited investment budget, like $200, you'll want to make sure you're only buying the best available options.\n\nThese three companies all have stocks that trade for less than $200 per share and offer excellent value for the growth potential ahead of them. All three are benefiting from the growth of AI and should play important roles in the future development of artificial intelligence and computing from here.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nMany investors are worried about the impact of artificial intelligence on Alphabet's (GOOG 1.25%) (GOOGL 1.14%) core Google Search product. Apple's Eddy Cue testified that search queries were down on its Safari browser during the month of April for the first time in 22 years, supporting the idea that AI services like ChatGPT are eating into its market share.\n\nBut a decline in searches on a single browser, while surprising, isn't too concerning. AI is a bigger boost to Alphabet than a challenge. It's seen great success with its AI Overviews in search queries, which management says increase engagement while monetizing at the same level as traditional search results. It's also leveraged AI to offer new features like circle-to-search and Google Lens, which overindex toward valuable product searches.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been a massive driver of growth for Alphabet's Google Cloud business. It saw revenue climb 28% in the first quarter, with its operating margin expanding from 9.4% to 17.8%. Management said it remains supply-constrained, so strong revenue growth should continue. On top of that, Google's bigger cloud computing competitors sport even higher operating margins, so there's room to expand profits as it scales.\n\nAt about $177 per share, the stock trades for about 18.5 times forward earnings expectations. That's well below comparable stocks, but Alphabet does have some regulatory pressure on its business on top of worries about how AI could negatively impact its cash flow. But with a massive cash-flowing business, an increasingly profitable cloud computing business, and a big capital return program, the stock looks very attractive at this level.\n\n2. Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm (QCOM 3.89%) isn't the chipmaker many people think of when they're talking about AI chip stocks. It doesn't make high-end GPUs or custom silicon solutions for AI training or inference. It makes chips that primarily end up in smartphones.\n\nBut Qualcomm has plans to enter the data center business, focusing on CPUs designed to work in tandem with AI accelerator chips. It believes its expertise in low-power, high-performance chips for smartphones will translate into very effective chip designs for data centers. It recently agreed to acquire Alphawave Semi with the aim of bolstering its data center capabilities.\n\nThe company will face significant competition in that market, but not all AI inference will take place in the cloud. There's a growing push to perform AI processing on devices themselves, which provides advantages in security, privacy, and speed.\n\nTo that end, Qualcomm is well-positioned to see a growing share of the market, as its Snapdragon mobile processors are found in most high-end Android devices. As on-device AI becomes a differentiator, demand for high-end devices could increase, boosting Qualcomm's mobile processor sales.\n\nIn the meantime, Qualcomm holds the patents for wireless baseband chips found in practically every phone. As a result, it collects a royalty for every smartphone sale. Apple is notably moving away from Qualcomm, developing its own chipsets, but the process is a big hurdle.\n\nFew other phone makers have the capability, capital, or scale necessary to cut out Qualcomm. As such, the licensing business should provide a stable source of earnings for the business for the foreseeable future.\n\nAt around $160 per share, the stock trades for just 13.5 times forward earnings. That's an incredible value for a company with strong long-term positions in Android phones, and it seems Apple's moves are weighing too heavily on the stock. With a potential data center business on the horizon, it could have another big business like its mobile processors. But even with just the mobile chips and licensing business producing steady free cash flow, it's still a great value at this price.\n\n3. Applied Materials\n\nWhile cloud computing providers are trying to stock their data centers with more and more chips for artificial intelligence training and inference, somebody has to make those chips. And in order to do that, you need specialized equipment.\n\nThat's where Applied Materials (AMAT 2.16%) comes in. The company produces a broad portfolio of wafer fabrication equipment, including etching, deposition, and process control.\n\nApplied Materials' ability to participate in all of those areas gives it an advantage. It can cross-sell manufacturers on its equipment, allowing it to compete with more specialized equipment makers. And as one of the largest equipment providers, it also has more revenue to reinvest in R&D to produce the next generation of equipment or expand its portfolio, creating a virtuous cycle and extending its technology lead.\n\nThe push to expand chip production has been a boon for Applied Materials. Despite sales restrictions in China and slower growth in the automotive segment, the equipment maker grew sales 7% in the first quarter. The shift toward more high-end devices also helped expand its gross margin to over 49% last quarter.\n\nApplied Materials' product is extremely sticky, too. Once a manufacturer buys its equipment, it wants to get the most out of it. That means a long product life and recurring service revenue.\n\nWith the stock trading at about $175 per share, it sports a forward P/E of about 18.5. That's a great value for a company growing revenue at a steady high-single-digit clip with expanding margins. While the business can be cyclical, the long-term trend is for more and more advanced chip sales. Applied Materials is well-positioned to capitalize on that trend, and its current stock price gives investors a great opportunity to buy into it.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:15:52.310675+00:00"}

As a result, several cloud hyperscalers are tapping Broadcom's custom chips and networking components to lower operating costs when running AI training and inference applications.\n\nThis explains why Broadcom's growth has been outstanding in recent quarters. Moreover, a massive addressable revenue opportunity in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion suggests that it is at the beginning of a solid growth curve. Not surprisingly, even Qualcomm (QCOM 3.89%) wants a piece of this lucrative opportunity, and it has just made a move that could help it make a dent in the custom AI chip market.\n\nQualcomm wants to get into AI data centers\n\nQualcomm has just announced that it is set to acquire British chip company Alphawave Semi for $2.4 billion with the aim to \"further accelerate, and provide key assets for, Qualcomm's expansion into data centers.\" Alphawave's technology will allow Qualcomm to integrate high-speed connectivity into its AI chip platforms to enable rapid data transfer, which will in turn lead to higher computing performance and reduced power consumption.\n\nQualcomm believes that Alphawave's \"products form a part of the core infrastructure enabling next generation services in a wide array of high growth applications, including data centers, AI, data networking and data storage.\" The chipmaker announced last month that it is set to reenter the data center market. The company is reportedly developing a custom AI chip platform using its Oryon central processing unit (CPU) and Hexagon neural processing unit (NPU) processors, which it claims are capable enough to meet AI inferencing workloads in data centers.\n\nThe latest acquisition is another piece of the puzzle as Qualcomm gears up for the launch of a data center-focused chip platform. The company has already announced that it is partnering with Saudi Arabia-backed AI venture HUMAIN to build AI data centers in that country, suggesting that Qualcomm could get a foot in the door and eventually make its presence felt in the huge custom AI processor market.\n\nImportantly, there is space for another player in this market which is currently dominated by Broadcom with an estimated share of 70%. Marvell Technology controls the rest of this market. So, if Qualcomm can develop a cutting-edge product, it could end up becoming the third player here. That could give its business a big boost in the long run, considering the end-market opportunity on offer.\n\nThe valuation and the existing growth drivers make the stock worth buying\n\nQualcomm currently gets its revenue from selling chips that go into three product lines -- handsets, automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT). All these segments are benefiting from the proliferation of AI. This explains why Qualcomm's top line in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 jumped 15% year over year to $10.8 billion, while adjusted earnings shot up 17% year over year.\n\nThe adoption of AI across these three markets is set to grow at a healthy pace. For example, AI adoption in the automotive market could grow at an annual rate of 37% over the next decade, while generative AI shipments are expected to increase at an annual rate of 78% through 2028. If Qualcomm is able to add another growth driver to its portfolio in the form of data centers, it won't be surprising to see it growing at a stronger pace in the long run.\n\nThat's why buying Qualcomm stock right now could turn out to be a smart thing to do, as it is trading at just 15 times trailing earnings.", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:15:57.976775+00:00"}

Still, that doesn’t stop me from seeing the stock as a long-term Buy—especially since my bullish", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-qualcomm-qcom-long-term-220400493.html", "published_at": "2025-06-11T22:04:00Z", "source": "TipRanks", "text": "Roughly 18% of its assets are classified as goodwill, indicating a strong track record of acquisitions, which is clearly part of its strategy to acquire intellectual property (IP) or talent rather than build everything in-house. One recent example is the $2.4 billion acquisition of the UK-based semiconductor firm Alphawave .\n\nAs a fabless semiconductor company, Qualcomm relies on external manufacturing partners such as TSMC (TSM) and Samsung (SSNLF) for chip production. Notably, only approximately 7% of its $55.3 billion in total assets is allocated to property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), which is relatively low compared to the industry average. This underscores the efficiency of its asset-light business model and the minimal physical infrastructure required to support its operations.\n\nWhen looking for value stocks, one of the most important factors—if not the most important—is a company’s ability to generate consistent earnings. Examining QCOM’s balance sheet reveals a capital-light, high-margin model driven by intellectual property (IP) and characterized by heavy investment in research and development (R&D) .\n\nBeyond that, Qualcomm’s asset-light model allows it to generate very high returns on its investments, highlighting its operational efficiency, strong financial health, and consistent value creation for shareholders. This helps justify the company trading at a slightly stretched valuation when considering its operational profits relative to enterprise value.\n\nStill, that doesn’t stop me from seeing the stock as a long-term Buy—especially since my bullishness comes from Qualcomm’s key competitive advantage: its ability to build the Snapdragon platform, which integrates a modem, CPU, and even a GPU chip—something no other competitor can currently match. This positions the company to tap into new business opportunities that could help offset its current customer concentration.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) has underperformed over the past year, declining 26%, primarily due to macroeconomic factors rather than internal company mechanics. Although the company’s fundamentals remain very solid, it has faced some headwinds, such as concerns that its business is too concentrated on Apple (AAPL) for modem revenue, despite its broader operations still being more rooted in the Android ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, approximately 12% of Qualcomm’s total assets are tied to IP licensing and chip design. That makes sense, given its dominant position in the Android smartphone chip market, especially in the high-end segment with its Snapdragon lineup.\n\nThe Power of Lean Capital at Work\n\nGiven that around 37% of Qualcomm’s total assets are intangible, it’s worth considering the company’s actual operational efficiency once these intangibles are excluded. To gain a clearer picture, it is sensible to examine how Qualcomm allocates its limited tangible capital to generate profits.\n\nOver the past twelve months, Qualcomm produced an operating profit of $12.3 billion. During the same period, its net working capital was approximately $2.7 billion, and its invested capital—mainly property, plant, and equipment, and other intangibles—totaled roughly $8.28 billion. Dividing the operating profit by this invested capital plus working capital yields an eye-catching ~112% return on capital (ROC).\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) revenue, earnings and profit margin history\n\nThat kind of number highlights Qualcomm’s exceptional operational efficiency, something typically only seen in asset-light, IP-driven tech or software companies. For context, most of these firms operate with a return on capital (ROC) well below 50%.\n\nIn short, despite a balance sheet loaded with intangibles, Qualcomm proves that it’s highly efficient with the real capital it uses. And that translates into three key advantages: sustainable value creation, a durable competitive moat, and stronger financial flexibility.\n\nWhy Qualcomm’s Price Tag Might Still Make Sense\n\nEven a company with a high return on capital isn’t necessarily a buy—not if you’re overpaying for it. That’s why it’s vital to assess operating profitability in relation to the company’s total valuation, not just traditional P/E or P/B metrics. One way to do this is by comparing operating profit to enterprise value (EV), which reflects what the market is actually paying for the entire business.\n\nIn Qualcomm’s case, we can measure this by dividing its operating profit by its enterprise value (EV). Over the last twelve months, Qualcomm generated $12.3 billion in operating profit, while its current enterprise value stands at $164.6 billion. That results in an earnings yield of 7.5%.\n\nTo interpret that number correctly, it should be compared to Qualcomm’s cost of capital. Using a 10-year treasury yield of 4.5%, a beta of 1.2, and an equity risk premium of 4–5%, the estimated cost of equity falls between 9% and 10%. Since the earnings yield of 7.5% is below this range, Qualcomm doesn’t appear particularly cheap at the moment. However, judged against historic performance against the S&P 500 (SPX), QCOM stock has underperformed.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) vs. SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)\n\nThat said, this isn’t necessarily a red flag. Even if the stock looks a bit expensive on this metric, Qualcomm continues to create value through its exceptional return on capital and strong cash generation. This is reflected in its sustainable 2.28% dividend yield and $16.5 billion in share buybacks over the past four years.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Dividend Date & History\n\nGiven Qualcomm’s maturity, profitability, and operational efficiency, a lower earnings yield may be viewed as acceptable, reflecting a premium for quality and stability.\n\nIs QCOM a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nAnalyst sentiment on Qualcomm stock is somewhat mixed. Out of 17 experts who’ve issued ratings in the past three months, eight are bullish, eight are neutral, and just one is bearish. Still, there’s little hesitation when it comes to upside expectations. Qualcomm’s average stock price target is at $177.75, suggesting ~14% in potential upside over the next twelve months.\n\nQualcomm’s Value Goes Beyond the Price Tag\n\nWhile traditional valuation metrics may indicate that Qualcomm is undervalued, I believe that perspective overlooks the company’s strong operational efficiency. Qualcomm doesn’t need to appear “cheap” to represent a compelling investment opportunity. Its robust, above-average returns on capital, driven by an asset-light business model, demonstrate its ability to create substantial shareholder value and may, in fact, justify a valuation premium.\n\nViewed through this fundamental lens, and given Qualcomm’s consistent track record of long-term value creation, I consider it a solid long-term investment, even at its current, relatively full valuation.\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue", "fulltext_ok": true, "error": null, "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T11:16:00.398081+00:00"}

This demands rapid and continuous investment in technological advancements, which strains the margin. NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is emerging as a major competitor for Qualcomm in automotive. NVIDIA Drive solutions offer hardware and software tools that developers need for autonomous vehicle development. QCOM is also facing stiff competition from Intel Corporation INTC in the emerging field of AI PCs. Moreover, long-time customers such as Apple and Samsung’s focus on in-house chip development is a major concern.\n\n\n\nQualcomm has a significant presence in China. A vast part of its customers includes Chinese manufacturers, which further clouds the revenue-generating potential owing to the strained bilateral trade relationship with the United States. The imposition of high tariffs can significantly impact Qualcomm’s revenue stream.\n\n\n\nMoreover, Qualcomm has conducted several strategic acquisitions to expand its portfolio to cater to the automotive, AI and IoT markets. Although its aggressive acquisition spree can boost market opportunity, it also raises integration risks.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nQCOM shares have declined 26.4% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 18.7%. The company has outperformed Intel but underperformed relative to NVIDIA. Intel has declined 33.5%, while NVIDIA has increased 18%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimate Revision Trend of QCOM\n\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have decreased 0.25% to $11.81 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 has decreased 3.18% to $12.19. This portrays bearish sentiments about the stock’s growth potential from investors.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEnd Note\n\nQualcomm is witnessing healthy market traction in the automotive, Android handset and industrial IoT markets. Its new Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform is already witnessing solid momentum, as major mobile makers such as HONOR and Vivo are set to adopt the chipset. Its efforts to strengthen its business model, revenue diversification, and portfolio expansion through a combined approach of innovation and acquisitions are positive.\n\n\n\nHowever, Qualcomm’s extensive reliance on China and growing Sino-U.S. trade uncertainties are major concerns. Growing competition in each of its served markets is weighing on margins. Downtrend in estimate underscores investors’ growing concern about the company’s long-term prospects. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Qualcomm appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.
