Figma's valuation at debut far exceeds the $20 billion price tag from a now-abandoned buyout deal with industry giant Adobe in December 2023.  \"Fast-growing software IPOs have been extremely rare during the past three years, so deals like this tend to get a lot of attention,\" said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs."^^xsd:string ;

Apple has struggled to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet's Google, both of which have attracted hundreds of millions of users to their AI-powered chatbots and assistants.  Apple, in contrast, has leaned on outside data center providers to handle some of its cloud computing work, and despite a high-profile partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI for certain iPhone features, has tried to grow much of its AI technology in-house, including improvements to its Siri virtual assistant."^^xsd:string ;

You don't want American presidents dictating who runs companies, but certainly his opinion has merit and weight.\"Intel and Tan did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment."^^xsd:string ;

    ex:summary "STORY: U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, with the Dow dropping about one percent, the S&P 500 shedding four-tenths of a percent, but the Nasdaq ticked up nearly two-tenths of a percent.It was the fourth session out of five that the technology-heavy Nasdaq posted a record close.AI-chip leader Nvidia was the primary factor. Its shares jumped 4% after the company unveiled plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chip to China, explained Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance.\"As we know, Nvidia is the highest-valued stock in the market in the world, north of $4 trillion. So, when Nvidia moves sharply higher, which it is today, that in and of itself can move the Nasdaq. But Oracle, Apple, Microsoft, which are now over 500, those tech stocks are back in control for sure, and that is what's moving the market today.\"The news buoyed other chipmakers, with Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer gaining nearly six-and-a-half and seven percent, respectively.Meanwhile, Wall Street banks kicked off second-quarter earnings season, with their stocks whipsawing in volatile trade.Shares of Wells Fargo slid five-and-a-half percent after the bank cut its net interest income forecast, though it beat quarterly profit estimates.JPMorgan Chase raised its 2025 net interest income outlook, but shares still ended lower.BlackRock said its assets under management hit a new high in the second quarter as global markets rallied, but its shares tumbled nearly six percent after it said a large Asian institutional client pulled money from an index strategy.Bucking the trend, Citigroup climbed more than three-and-a-half percent to its highest finish since the global financial crisis, after its traders delivered a windfall that boosted second-quarter profit.Data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer prices posted their biggest jump in five months in June, hinting that tariffs may be starting to heat up inflation.Still, underlying inflation stayed moderate.Markets are betting the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady this month, with a more than 50% chance the central bank will resume rate cuts in September."^^xsd:string ;

The Trump administration this month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) to China,  reversing an effective ban imposed in April designed to keep advanced AI chips out of Chinese hands due to national security concerns.
